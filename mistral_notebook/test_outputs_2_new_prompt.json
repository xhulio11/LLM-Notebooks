    " Title: U.S. Accuses China of Intellectual Property Theft, Raising Questions on Innovation and Trust\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a report on Monday, the Pentagon accused China of stealing innovative ideas from American industries for strategic gain. This allegation, while not new in business circles, marks the first time the United States government has made such a claim so explicitly. The accusation forces China's leaders to confront two questions:\n\n1. Why does China resort to systematic intellectual property theft through cyber-espionage, reverse engineering, and other means, when it could trust itself to innovate?\n2. Why can't China simply innovate independently, given its significant government investments in research and the production of engineers?\n\nIndustrial theft is common in almost every country, including the U.S. However, China's scale and official level of intellectual property theft have led the U.S. government to point a finger at Beijing. According to one American think tank, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, China's theft of U.S. intellectual property cost nearly 1 million U.S. jobs in 2009.\n\nDespite China's investments in \"independent innovation,\" such as science parks and clean energy, the country's top-down economic planning and state-run enterprises hinder the emergence of a Steve Jobs-type figure. An official policy since 2006 to quickly innovate Chinese industry has led to high rates of plagiarism in scientific papers and other research misconduct.\n\nChina's long dependency on foreign technology and its drive to develop its economy quickly may be reasons for its tendency to take other people's creative work. However, it could also be that a people living under a ruling party that suppresses the truth don't feel safe in striving for truth. India, which has far less government money for research, does well in its open society to inspire technological innovation.\n\nTruth-seeking has a long tradition in the West, where religion focuses on the idea of a rational Creator. China also has a long history of importing ideas, such as Mao Zedong importing communism and Deng Xiaoping bringing in Western-style market capitalism. The quest for truth is not alien to China; it now simply needs to look to its own people for creativity rather than take it from elsewhere.",
    " Title: White House Security Clearance Process Allegedly Weaponized by Career Bureaucrats, Says Federal Security Clearance Lawyer\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal security clearance lawyer, Sean M. Bigley, has accused a small group of career bureaucrats in the White House personnel security office of using the security clearance process as a tool to obstruct President Trump's agenda and prevent him from installing appointees who will execute it. This allegation bolsters White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly's criticism of the security office and sheds light on recent incidents involving security clearances that have embarrassed the administration.\n\nMr. Bigley, who represents several senior administration officials caught up in the process, stated that the security clearance process is being weaponized by anti-Trump bureaucrats. He described the process as quicksand that ensnares the President's team. The foot-dragging in the security clearance process is prevalent throughout the administration, but it is most visible and startling at the White House.\n\nThe completed FBI background checks routinely get snagged by the office, also known as EOP Security, which is manned by fewer than a dozen career officials. The office has a reputation for bureaucratic inefficiency stretching back several administrations, but it now has adopted an adversarial stance toward Mr. Trump.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bigley, there is a hostility and institutional arrogance in the lack of willingness to engage from EOP Security. He stated that he is unable to get a phone call returned, and he is representing senior people in the administration who are asking for basic answers as to why EOP Security is still sitting on their background investigation a year after it has been completed.\n\nSecurity clearance problems grabbed headlines in early February when Rob Porter was forced to resign as White House staff secretary after his two ex-wives went public with accusations of spousal abuse. The White House mishandled the episode, and public outrage, fueled in part by a photograph of ex-wife Colbie Holderness with a black eye, quickly forced the White House to oust Mr. Porter.\n\nThe nearly yearlong delay occurred in the personnel security office. Mr. Porter was one of as many as 40 officials at the White House working with interim security clearance after more than a year because the process was mired. When the FBI background check reveals negative information about a White House official, the personnel security office usually would inform the chief of staff and White House counsel about the \"suitability\" concern. A White House aide with a \"suitability\" problem would usually resign.\n\nThe FBI delivered the background check to the personnel security office in March 2017. Security clearance professionals have questioned why the information was not transmitted to Mr. Kelly or White House counsel Donald McGahn. \"The question mark is whether that was communicated to anybody else in the administration,\" said Mr. Bigley. \"Based on my experience dealing with EOP Security, I think they probably did just sit on this and drop the ball.\"\n\nMr. Kelly targeted the communication breakdown in a memo outlining an overhaul of the security clearance process in the wake of the Porter debacle. He ordered the FBI to hand-deliver background investigation files to the White House counsel, bypassing the personnel security office.\n\nThe overhaul of the security clearance system, including reining in the number of interim clearances, prompted Mr. Kelly to order the downgrade of Mr. Kushner's top-secret clearance. Mr. Kushner still has clearance for access to government secrets although not at the highest level, which would include the president's daily briefings by intelligence agencies.",
    " Title: President Trump's Actions and Media Interactions: A Daily Political Update\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events over the past week, President Donald J. Trump has engaged in a public feud with CNN, continued efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and hosted a Fourth of July celebration at the White House.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump shared a video of himself body-slamming someone with a CNN logo superimposed on his face, prompting a response from CNN stating, \"It's a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters... We will keep doing our jobs. He should start doing his.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly working on changes to the GOP health care bill this week, rather than repealing Obamacare first as suggested by the president. Trump is set to return to Washington D.C. tonight to celebrate the Fourth of July. He and First Lady Melania Trump will host a picnic for military families at the White House Tuesday, followed by a viewing of fireworks.\n\nThe president's actions towards the media have been described as a \"strategy\" but also as impulsive outbursts driven by short-term tactical decisions. The president's tweets and actions are a source of controversy, with some viewing them as a return to the norm and others as a cause for concern.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie's spokesperson stated that Christie and his family spent Sunday on a closed beach despite ordering a government shutdown. In response to criticism, Christie's spokesperson said, \"He did not get any sun. He had a baseball hat on.\"\n\nPresident Trump's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, defended the president's CNN tweet Sunday, stating that \"no one would perceive that as a threat.\" Bossert also praised Trump as the \"most genuine president... we've seen in [ his ] lifetime.\"\n\nRepublican Governor John Kasich of Ohio has criticized the current version of the Senate Republican health care bill, stating that it is \"not an acceptable choice\" and makes it harder for states to treat opioid addicts. Kasich said, \"If you cut $750 billion out of Medicaid, and in the out years you basically starve the program, we have to choose between children, seniors, the disabled, the addicted, the mentally ill.\"\n\nAt least 17 states are balking at the Trump administration's request for voter registration data as part of the new election integrity commission, with six states outright declining to provide the information. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon has expressed \"serious doubts about the commission's trustworthiness.\"\n\nThe Note is a daily feature that highlights the key political moments of the day ahead.

    " Title: US Justice Department Launches Criminal Investigation into Michael Cohen, Trump's Former Lawyer\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Justice Department has announced that Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, is under criminal investigation. Prosecutors are reportedly focusing on Cohen's business dealings rather than his work as a lawyer.\n\nAccording to a court filing, Cohen has been under investigation for months. The filing was in response to efforts by Cohen's own lawyer to stop prosecutors from reviewing material seized from Cohen's office on Monday. Cohen's team argues that the papers are covered by the attorney-client privilege.\n\nPresident Trump has condemned the office raid, calling it \"disgraceful\" and \"an attack on our country.\" During a court hearing in New York on Friday, prosecutor Tom McKay accused Cohen of trying to use attorney-client privilege \"as a sword to challenge the government's ability to review evidence.\"\n\nGovernment prosecutors also said they believed Cohen had \"a low volume of potentially privileged communication\" because he seems to only have one client - President Trump. The filing stated, \"It is neither apparent that Cohen, in his capacity as an attorney, has many, or any, attorney-client relationships other than with President Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe filing added that while Cohen was an attorney, \"he also has several other business interests and sources of income.\" The investigation is reportedly focused on Cohen's personal business dealings.\n\nA new lawyer for President Trump, Joanna Hendon, said the president had an \"acute interest\" in the case. Ms. Hendon, who was hired on Wednesday, asked the judge to adjourn the session so she had more time to prepare.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, the president phoned Cohen to \"check in\" on him today. Lawyers tend to advise clients not to discuss investigations, which means their discussion could cause them problems, depending on what they talked about.\n\nIn a separate development, Cohen reportedly negotiated a $1.6 million settlement with a former Playboy model on behalf of a Republican fundraiser, according to a Wall Street Journal article. Elliott Broidy, a Los Angeles investor, acknowledged \"a consensual relationship\" with the Playmate, who became pregnant.\n\nMr. Broidy said it was \"unfortunate\" that the personal matter was \"the subject of national discussion\" because of the involvement of Cohen. Mr. Broidy was previously in the news after he urged President Trump to sack then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over a diplomatic dispute.\n\nCohen has admitted to having paid a porn actress, Stormy Daniels, $130,000 before the 2016 US presidential election. Ms. Daniels claims she had an affair with Mr. Trump, and he and his lawyers made attempts to buy her silence.",
    " Title: \"The New York Times Corrects Inaccuracies and Errors in 2016 Reporting\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Times, in a move to maintain transparency and uphold journalistic integrity, has issued corrections for several significant errors, inaccuracies, and misrepresentations in its reporting from 2016. The following is a list of the five most notable instances:\n\n1. Claim of 17 Intelligence Agencies Agreeing on Russia:\nIn a June report, The New York Times repeated the baseless claim that 17 U.S. intelligence agencies agreed Russia was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election. This claim was debunked by the \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation fact-check team in a report published approximately one month prior. The New York Times later issued a correction, acknowledging that only four intelligence agencies came to a consensus on Russian meddling.\n\n2. Parody Twitter Account Mistaken for North Korean Government:\nNew York Times reporters incorrectly attributed a tweet mocking American military efforts to the North Korean government, when the tweet was actually the product of a parody account. The DPRK News Service, which claims to be the \"official News feed of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea,\" is run by two Americans, according to The Washington Post. The New York Times later issued a correction acknowledging they fell for the parody.\n\n3. Food Stamps and Soda Reporting:\nThe New York Times misreported data from a government study on what people buy on food stamps, then updated the story with an additional error without issuing a correction. The central claim of the January story, headlined, \"In the Shopping Cart of a Food Stamp Household: Lots of Soda,\" was that the Department of Agriculture has a report showing food stamps recipients spend nearly 10 cents of every dollar on soft drinks. However, this number is almost double what the report actually said. The updated version still incorrectly stated that soft drinks are not included in the \"sweetened beverages\" category, when in fact, they are.\n\n4. Attorney General Jeff Sessions Statement:\nNew York Times editor Jonathan Weisman was forced to retract a June tweet insinuating Attorney General Jeff Sessions was corrupt. Weisman asserted former FBI Director James Comey testified that Sessions asked him directly to call the Russia probe \"a matter.\" However, Comey had actually testified that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, not Sessions, had approached him with that request.\n\n5. Correction to Editorial Attacking Sarah Palin:\nAfter a man shot up a GOP congressional baseball practice in May, The New York Times used a debunked conspiracy theory to attack former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in an editorial. The paper baselessly linked her campaign messaging to the shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011. After substantial public backlash, The New York Times heavily edited the piece and added a correction, stating, \"An editorial on Thursday about the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs.\"",
    " Title: Understanding Narrow Political Victories: A Call for Empathy and Bipartisanship\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent electoral college votes have confirmed the narrow victories of the expected candidates, with Donald Trump winning by 77,744 votes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This small margin of victory has led to significant changes, including a more conservative Supreme Court, a potential rollback of Obamacare, and a shift in policies regarding fossil fuel usage.\n\nThis is not the first time that such a large difference in public policies has been made by a small vote margin. For instance, if Al Franken had not been declared the winner of the 2008 U.S. Senate race in Minnesota by 302 votes, there would have been no 60th vote to push through Obamacare in 2010.\n\nThe political system in the United States is known for producing big policy consequences from small vote margins, even microscopic ones. This has been strengthened in recent decades by increasing partisan polarization. In the past, political scientists suggested that the country should have one clearly liberal and one clearly conservative party. Today, we have a two-party system that incentivizes each party to aim for more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nHowever, this system also emphasizes what divides us, as often neither party gets to 50 percent. This has been the case in 15 of the 41 Democratic-Republican presidential contests since 1856, and in the 1876 presidential race, when Samuel Tilden lost by one electoral vote.\n\nIn light of the recent election results, Michael Barone, a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner and a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, offers suggestions for moving forward. One suggestion is to empathize with those who hold different political views. By understanding why good people support the candidate you oppose, one can change one's view and foster a more empathetic society.\n\nAnother suggestion is to stop playing team ball, as there is a gulf between Trump's views and those of many conservatives and elected Republicans. With no incumbent Democratic president, liberals will have no single leader setting an agenda.\n\nLastly, Barone advises against getting strung out on process arguments, such as the recent debate about the Electoral College. Process arguments are often insincere, and all parties should focus on understanding and working towards a more empathetic and bipartisan society.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree on Denuclearization of Korean Peninsula; Trump, Xi Discuss Tensions with North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a phone conversation on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on the shared goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, according to a White House statement and a report on Chinese state television. During the call, Xi requested that the U.S. and North Korea tone down their recent rhetoric and avoid actions that could escalate tensions.\n\nThe leaders affirmed that the recent adoption of a new United Nations Security Council resolution regarding North Korea was an important and necessary step toward achieving peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. They agreed that North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior. The leaders also reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe White House confirmed early Saturday that Trump and Xi spoke on Friday. The statement added that Trump was looking forward to meeting with Xi in China later this year. The trip, announced in April, was recently confirmed by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who met in Manila with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nTrump has urged China to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program, which North Korea says is nearing the capability of targeting the United States. China is North Korea's biggest economic partner and source of aid, but says it alone cannot compel Pyongyang to end its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged Saturday to do \"everything, to the best of my ability,\" to protect his nation's people as tensions escalate over North Korea's plans to send missiles over Japan toward Guam. Abe made the comments while visiting his father's tomb in his ancestral hometown of Nagato, in western Japan.\n\nOn Friday, Japan's Defense Ministry said it was deploying four surface-to-air Patriot interceptors in western Japan to respond to a possible risk of fragments falling from missiles. The ministry did not confirm whether newly appointed Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera has already issued an order to shoot down incoming missiles.\n\nTrump on Friday issued fresh threats of swift and forceful retaliation against nuclear North Korea, declaring the U.S. military \"locked and loaded\" and warning that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, would \"regret it fast\" if he takes any action against U.S. territories or allies.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Surges in January, Wages Increase at Largest Pace in Nearly a Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States added 200,000 jobs in January, and wages rose at the fastest pace in more than eight years, according to the latest report from the U.S. Department of Labor. The unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.\n\nThe nonfarm payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month, following a rise of 160,000 in December. The average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent in January to $26.74, building on December's solid 0.4 percent gain. This boosted the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest rise since June 2009.\n\nThe robust employment report indicates a strong momentum in the economy. Economists attribute job gains to buoyant domestic and global demand. However, the report suggests that the U.S. economy is approaching full employment, and job growth is expected to slow this year. Companies are reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, which economists say will force some to significantly raise wages as they compete for scarce labor.\n\nWage growth in January was likely supported by increases in the minimum wage that came into effect in 18 states in January, as well as the tax cut. Companies like Starbucks Corp and FedEx Corp have announced plans to boost wages for workers due to the tax cuts, and further gains are expected in February when Walmart raises entry-level wages for hourly employees at its U.S. stores.\n\nWhile the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are unquestionably healthy, the actual growth numbers for the first quarter of 2018 remain to be seen. The New York Fed's estimate for Q4 of 2017 was robust, but the actual number ended up falling well short. The economy's strength and the extent of its growth are subjects of ongoing debate among economists.",
    " Title: CIA Director Warns of Potential Increased Terrorist Attacks, Political Divide on Prevention Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nCIA Director John Brennan delivered an urgent warning to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, stating that the Islamic State (ISIL) has the capacity to carry out further Orlando-style terrorist attacks in the near future. Brennan stated, \"We judge that ISIL is training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks.\"\n\nBrennan explained that ISIL is exploring various methods for infiltration, such as joining the flow of refugees into Western countries, using smuggling routes, and commercial travel. The Islamic State reportedly has a significant number of Western fighters who could potentially serve as operatives for attacks in the West.\n\nThe political landscape regarding the prevention of future terrorist attacks in the United States is divided, with Democrats advocating for stricter gun laws and Republicans urging tougher action against ISIS and Islamic extremists. Critics of President Barack Obama argue that his immigration policies and foreign policy decisions have contributed to terrorist attacks, such as the Orlando massacre.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., stated that the president is \"directly responsible\" for the Orlando mass shooting due to the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, which led to the rise of ISIS. McCain later retracted the statement, saying the president's policies led to the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is set to vote on new gun control legislation on Monday. Democrats are advocating for a policy called \"no fly, no buy,\" which would prohibit individuals on a terror watch list from purchasing a firearm. Under current law, the FBI is already notified when terror suspects attempt to buy weapons. House Republicans have stated they do not plan to consider new gun legislation.\n\nPresumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump criticized the president during a speech in Dallas on Thursday, vowing to protect American gun rights. Trump stated, \"To a large extent he's blaming guns and I'm going to save your Second Amendment folks. I'm going to save your Second Amendment.\" Earlier in the week, Trump suggested that more people at the Orlando nightclub with guns could have prevented the tragedy.\n\nDuring his visit to Orlando on Thursday, President Obama criticized this suggestion, stating, \"The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to assure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense.\"\n\nIn a show of solidarity, Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama placed flowers at the Orlando memorial. Meanwhile, a Christian from Illinois drove 1,200 miles to place 49 crosses at the site, each cross bearing the name of a victim. The individual, Greg Zanis, explained, \"My message today is love your brother, love your neighbor. Do not judge them... I'm just offering hope in a very hopeless situation.\"",
    " Title: FBI Foils Terror Plot in Brooklyn, New York, Arresting Three Uzbek Men Planning to Join ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted a series of terror raids in Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday, resulting in the arrest of three men from Uzbekistan who were allegedly planning to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State (ISIS) and potentially carry out acts of domestic terrorism in the United States.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the youngest man, identified as Akhror Saidakhmetov, reportedly posted on an Uzbek-language website in the last six months that he would buy a machine gun and shoot police officers and FBI agents if his plan to join ISIS was thwarted. In August 2014, 24-year-old suspect Abdurasul Hasanofvich Juraboev allegedly posted on the same board that he would kill President Obama if ISIS asked him to.\n\nThe plot is described as \"aspirational, not operational,\" but the early stages of the plan seemed to be progressing, as Saidakhmetov was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) while attempting to board a plane to Istanbul. Juraboev's plane ticket would have taken him to Turkey a month later. The third suspect, Abror Habibov, allegedly operated a domestic support network for the trio.\n\nThe individuals were reportedly inspired by the Islamic State's social media outreach program, including Tweets and forum posts calling for \"lone wolf\" jihadis to launch attacks in America and Europe. Fox News reports that two of the men came to the attention of law enforcement last summer after they expressed online support for the group. They have been charged with conspiracy to provide material support to the Islamic State and could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe UK Daily Mail quotes Saidakhmetov's detailed plans, as laid out to a criminal informant, to carry out acts of violence if he could not enter Syria. He reportedly stated that he would \"just go buy a machine gun, AK-47, and shoot all police.\" He had a four-stage plan in mind: \"It is legal in America to carry a gun. We will go and purchase one handgun and then go and shoot on a police officer. Boom! Then we will take his gun, bullets, and bulletproof vest. Then we will do the same with a couple of others. Then we will go to the FBI headquarters and kill the FBI people.\"\n\nThe New York Daily News also reports a quote from a post allegedly left by Juraboev on an ISIS-aligned website: \"We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present [in Syria]. I am in the USA now but we don't have any arms. Is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I'm saying is to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the heart of infidels.\"\n\nThe three men do not appear to have been particularly skilled or sophisticated terror operatives. However, as the New York Daily News notes, \"lone wolf\" jihad does not require much in the way of clever strategy or slick tradecraft. The report concludes with a reminder from NYPD counter-terrorism chief John Miller, who warned back in June that there were more than 100 would-be jihadis lurking in New York City.",
    " Title: Romney's Vice Presidential Pick: Condoleezza Rice - A Potential Game Changer for the 2012 Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe speculation surrounding Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick for the 2012 presidential race has gained momentum, with former Bush administration Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice emerging as a strong contender. This development was reported by the Drudge Report on Thursday, and Romney's wife, Ann, has hinted at the possibility of a female running mate.\n\nRice received a warm reception at Romney's donor retreat in Utah and a standing ovation at a GOP women's fundraiser in Washington, D.C. This week. If selected, Rice would be the first African-American woman to be on a major party's presidential ticket, a move that could help the GOP regain ground with minority, female voters, and single women, who have been a demographic challenge for the party.\n\nRice's selection would not be a mere political fad, as her experience and political acumen would compensate for Romney's lack of international experience. As a former secretary of state, Rice's expertise on foreign policy would be a valuable asset to the ticket. However, her stance on abortion and her role in the Bush administration, particularly in the Iraq war and the weapons of mass destruction controversy, could face opposition from both the left and the right.\n\nRice has also shown political courage by standing up for immigrants, opposing individual states' efforts to increase the pursuit of illegal immigrants. This stance could help the Romney campaign win over Latino voters, a critical demographic in the upcoming election.\n\nAnother critical reason for Romney to pick Rice is her involvement in the education reform movement. She has partnered with Joel Klein, the former chancellor of the New York City public school system, to draw attention to the crisis in American public education. The duo co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations panel that examined the failure of public education as a threat to America's national security.\n\nThe panel's report found that 75 percent of American young adults do not qualify to serve in the military due to criminal records, physical unfitness, or inadequate levels of education. This includes about half of the nation's black and Hispanic students, who drop out of high school. The report also highlighted the U.S. State Department's inability to find enough foreign-language speakers to serve as interpreters and translators.\n\n\"The education crisis may well be the greatest threat to our national security,\" Rice stated at a recent speech before the Heritage Foundation in Washington. \"The crisis in K-12 is producing unemployable people who will ultimately be on the dole because they will have nowhere else to go.\"\n\nIn his election night speech in New Hampshire last week, Romney expressed a desire to \"stop the unfairness of urban children being denied access to the good schools of their choice.\" Rice's message on education reform could help jump-start the debate and potentially reform Romney's image, giving the education reform movement a boost.\n\nRegardless of the outcome in November, a Romney-Rice ticket could create a political legacy for both candidates and serve their country by addressing the critical issue of education reform. An earlier version of this column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.",
    " Title: Wood Mackenzie Predicts Solar Energy as the Next Major Breakthrough in U.S. Energy Supply\n\nArticle:\n\nThe declining oil prices may be slowing the U.S. shale boom, but the nation will remain a leading global producer of oil and natural gas well into the future, thanks to advances in drilling technology. As the U.S. energy sector looks to the future, a new study by Scotland-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie suggests that solar energy could be the next major breakthrough.\n\nIn a study titled \"Is Solar the Next Shale?\", Wood Mackenzie argues that steep reductions in the costs of making solar modules put that technology in a strong position to compete with other forms of electric power in many parts of the U.S. The study predicts that by 2020, parity between the economics of large-scale solar installations and those for gas combined-cycle and combustion plants will exist in 19 states, increasing to 38 by 2030.\n\nThe study asserts that, just as shale extraction reconfigured oil and gas markets, no other technology is closer to transforming power markets than distributed and utility-scale solar. Solar energy will continue to be a small part of total U.S. electric generating capacity, accounting for 6% of the nation's generating mix in 2035, compared to just 1% now. However, a relatively small amount of solar capacity can go a long way toward disrupting electric power markets.\n\nFor example, solar power contributes the most during the day, when the sun is shining and demand for electricity is often at its peak. That's also when fossil-fuel power plants, including natural gas units, make most of their money. Moreover, the trend is set to continue, as the cost of solar continues to come down while the cost of combined-cycle gas plants, the preferred option for utilities, rises.\n\nPrajit Ghosh, a research director with Wood Mackenzie, explains, \"We certainly see an upside to solar, a significant upside. And you really don't need that much solar to hurt the economics of fossil-fuel plants. Even a small amount of solar can have a pretty significant impact on the value of gas and coal plants and reliability.\"\n\nThe growing challenge for the electric power industry and its regulators is to integrate solar into the grid without forcing gas-fired power plants offline and disrupting the reliability of utility systems. California is already grappling with the issue, and other regions with significant solar potential, like Arizona, New Jersey, and Texas, will increasingly do so.\n\nRegarding the federal investment tax credit for solar systems on residential and commercial properties, which is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2016, Ghosh does not see any major setback for solar. He states, \"The level of cost savings we expect [in solar] will more than compensate for any reduction in tax credit support.\"\n\nBill Loveless, a veteran energy journalist and television commentator in Washington, wrote the article. Loveless is the former host of the TV program Platts Energy Week.",
    " Title: CNN Tonight with Don Lemon Draws Criticism for Segment Mocking Trump Supporters\n\nArticle:\n\nA segment on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon has sparked controversy after guests Wajahat Ali and Rick Wilson engaged in a discussion that some viewers perceived as mocking President Trump's supporters. The conversation, which took place on Saturday, included derogatory comments about the President's base, their geographical knowledge, and their reading and writing abilities.\n\nRick Wilson initiated the exchange by stating that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \"knows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn\u2019t find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and an actual crane.\" He further described Trump's base as a \"credulous, boomer rube\" demographic.\n\nWilson then mimicked a southern accent to say, \" 'Donald Trump\u2019s a smart one and y\u2019 all elitists are dumb.' \" Host Don Lemon laughed as Wilson mocked the voters. Ali joined in, saying, \" 'Your geography, maps, spelling, knowing other countries, sipping your latte.' \"\n\nWilson continued, \" 'All those lines on the map,' \" as Lemon's laughter persisted. Ali added, \" 'Only them elitists know where Ukraine is,' \" with both men laughing.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Ali jokingly apologized, saying, \" 'I'm sorry, it was Rick\u2019s fault. I blame Rick.' \" Lemon also attempted to regain his composure, stating, \" 'That was good. Sorry.' \"\n\nThe segment has drawn criticism on social media, with some users expressing disapproval of the perceived disdain, bigotry, and disrespect towards Trump supporters. Critics argue that the segment demonstrates a lack of decency and a disregard for those who hold different political views.\n\nThe controversy has led to discussions about the role of media in shaping public opinion and the importance of maintaining respectful and inclusive dialogue, particularly during political discourse.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Releases Transcripts of Interviews Regarding Trump Tower Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has released over 1,800 pages of transcripts from interviews with numerous figures involved in the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower. The controversial meeting, which initially fueled allegations of Trump campaign coordination with Russia, was downplayed in significance by Donald Trump Jr. and other key figures.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. testified that he was \"skeptical\" going into the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. In an email to him, Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting at the request of pop singer Emin Agalarov, suggested that someone had official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary Clinton and her dealings with Russia. However, the meeting provided no meaningful information and was primarily focused on Russian adoptions, according to Trump Jr.\n\nVeselnitskaya, in her written response, stated that no information specific to Clinton was provided in the meeting. She also lamented the \"kind of apocalyptic Hollywood scenario\" that a private conversation between a lawyer and a businessman can be turned into.\n\nTrump Jr. testified that if he was given information on Clinton, he would have then consulted with counsel to \"make an informed decision as to whether to give it any further consideration.\" He also noted that he was not aware of who would be in the meeting.\n\nIn addition to Trump Jr., the committee interviewed four other people who attended the Trump Tower meeting in New York: Rob Goldstone, Rinat Akhmetshin, Ike Kaveladze, and a translator. The panel was not able to interview Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, or Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, despite both attending the Trump Tower meeting.\n\nThe White House has stated that the president was involved in drafting an initial statement after news of the meeting broke last year. The statement said the meeting primarily concerned a Russian adoption program, though Trump Jr. later released emails showing he agreed to the sit-down after he was promised information on Clinton. The emails also show he accepted the meeting despite it being described as part of a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign.\n\nAsked in the interview if his father was involved in drafting the statement, Trump Jr. said: \"I do not know. I never spoke to my father about it.\" Trump Jr. also stressed that he did not tell his father about the meeting, saying \"I would not have wasted his time with it.\"\n\nTrump Jr. also told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he could not remember whether he had discussed the Russia investigation as a whole with his father, according to transcripts. He also said he did not think there was anything wrong with attending the Trump Tower meeting.\n\nLike Trump Jr. and Kushner, who released a public statement about the meeting last year, Goldstone said the meeting was disappointing. He said he reported back to Emin Agalarov that \"this was the most embarrassing thing you've ever asked me to do. I've just sat in a meeting about adoption.\"\n\nThe meeting is under scrutiny in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The testimony of Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson was also made public Wednesday, for a second time. His firm was behind the composition of the Trump dossier, filled with salacious and unverified allegations against the president regarding matters related to Russia.\n\nDespite Fox News' past reporting that Simpson was with Veselnitskaya before and after the Trump Tower meeting, Simpson said in testimony that he was not aware of the meeting beforehand, and was \"stunned\" to later learn about it. Trump Jr. testified that at the time of the Trump Tower meeting, he \"had never heard of Glenn Simpson or Fusion GPS.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement: \"These materials, taken in their entirety, provide the most complete public picture of the events surrounding the meeting to date. Americans can now review this unfiltered information and arrive at their own conclusions.\"",

The documents, which span from early January to April of 2017, include accounts of their first meeting, phone calls, and various other interactions.\n\nAccording to one memo, President Trump expressed \"serious reservations\" about the \"judgment\" of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with a Russian ambassador.\n\nIn a memo dated January 28, 2017, Comey claims he reassured Trump during a dinner that the FBI would be fair in its investigation into Russian collusion and interference in the 2016 election. Comey wrote that Trump had expressed a need for loyalty and expected it in return.\n\nDuring a phone conversation on March 30, Comey and Trump allegedly discussed the Russia investigation, with Trump urging Comey to tell the public that he was not under investigation. Comey wrote that he would \"see what we could do and we would do the work well and as quickly as we could.\"\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) reported on Thursday that the classified memos were sent to Congress and subsequently leaked to the press. The memos provide insight into the relationship between Comey and Trump during the early stages of the Trump administration.",
    " Title: Florida Surpasses 300,000 Confirmed COVID-19 Cases, Governor Addresses Testing Delays and Hospital Capacity\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida surpassed 300,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. The state now sits behind only California and New York in the number of confirmed cases it has reported. Health officials reported an additional 10,181 new confirmed cases Wednesday.\n\nFlorida took more than three months to reach 100,000 coronavirus cases but then took just two weeks to jump from 100,000 to 200,000. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis addressed the surge in infections during a news conference Wednesday, stating that the state is doing roughly 90,000 tests per day but that the results were taking too long to process.\n\n\"One thing that I think is clear is that we need to get these testing results back in a timely fashion,\" DeSantis said. The governor also announced that the state would be shifting business away from commercial labs that have not been able to return test results in 48 hours, as originally agreed upon when testing was expanded in the beginning of May. Contact-tracers have also said delays in testing results are making their jobs more difficult.\n\nFlorida also reported an additional 112 deaths on Wednesday. This was the third time in the past seven days it has reported more than 100 deaths, according to CBS Miami. More than 4,500 people have died in the state due to COVID-19.\n\nFlorida's emergency management director, Jared Moskowitz, compared the state's response to a hurricane, but one complicated by politics. \"When a Category 5 hits, nobody argues whether it was whether it was a Category 5, and in this disaster, we are arguing over everything,\" Moskowitz told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nDeSantis said additional medical personnel have been sent to Miami-Dade County, which is facing some of the highest infection rates in the state. Although the county's ICU beds are at capacity, the governor said the hospitals in the county still have plenty of other space that can be utilized for coronavirus patients. However, he added the real issue is a lack of healthcare workers.\n\nThe governor also announced the state will be introducing lanes at testing sites specifically for those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. People who use those lanes will administer the swabs themselves and their test results will be expedited, DeSantis said.",

In an internal employee meeting in July, Zuckerberg stated that he was \"worried\" about the possibility of a breakup and that he would \"bet that we will win the legal challenge\" if Warren were to pursue such a move.\n\nIn response to Zuckerberg's comments, Warren tweeted, \"What would really'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\"\n\nIn March, Warren outlined a plan to break up several tech giants, including Facebook, arguing that they have \"stifled innovation.\" If elected president, Warren stated that she would appoint regulators to unwind anti-competitive mergers like Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates, such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, have also expressed support for breaking up the tech giants.\n\nIn the July employee meeting, Zuckerberg expressed concern about the growing discussion around the power and dominance of tech companies and increased antitrust scrutiny from regulators. He argued that breaking up companies like Facebook would not solve the issues at hand and could actually make them worse. Zuckerberg argued that a broken-up Facebook would have fewer resources to detect hate speech and election interference efforts.\n\nZuckerberg's comments were made in the same month that Facebook reached a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy failures related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Critics argued that the deal was a slap on the wrist for a company that generates $16 billion in revenue in a three-month period. The Facebook staff meetings happened in the midst of an escalating national discussion over the power and dominance of the giant tech companies and increased antitrust scrutiny from regulators.",
    " Title: U.S. Evacuates Non-Emergency Personnel from Iraq Amidst Escalating Tensions with Iran\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has ordered the departure of non-emergency American employees from its diplomatic missions in Iraq due to perceived threats from Iran. The Trump administration is implementing new sanctions against Tehran and deploying additional forces to the Middle East to counter what it deems as an increased threat to U.S. soldiers and interests in the region.\n\nIran has labeled these actions as \"psychological warfare,\" and a British commander has expressed skepticism regarding U.S. military concerns about threats to its approximately 5,000 soldiers in Iraq, who are assisting local security forces in combating Islamic State jihadists.\n\nThe U.S. State Department announced that employees at both the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Erbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, are being immediately withdrawn due to safety concerns. The number of personnel affected and any specific threat details were not disclosed. Visa services were also suspended at the heavily fortified U.S. missions.\n\nA State Department spokesman stated, \"Ensuring the safety of U.S. government personnel and citizens is our highest priority... and we want to reduce the risk of harm.\"\n\nIn a similar move, Germany, which has 160 soldiers in Iraq, suspended military training operations due to increasing regional tensions. The Netherlands also suspended a mission providing assistance to Iraqi local authorities, according to Dutch news agency ANP.\n\nBoth the United States and Iran have stated they do not wish for war, and Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday he had indications \"things will end well\" despite the rhetoric. Iraq has stated it will maintain strong ties with Iran, the U.S., and regional neighbors, some of whom, like Saudi Arabia, view Tehran as an arch-rival.\n\nU.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN in an interview on Wednesday, \"I think we are now in a quite dangerous situation where a miscalculation by either side could lead us into conflict.\" Coons added, \"When you project force into a very volatile region and you've got real tension between Iran and the Saudis -- we have to be careful. We need a strategy.\"\n\nThe State Department reissued a travel advisory for Iraq, stating U.S. citizens were at high risk of violence and kidnapping. \"Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq,\" it said.\n\nA senior Iranian official stated on Wednesday that any conflict in the region will have \"unimaginable consequences.\"",
    " Title: Descendants of Confederate Military Leaders Divided on Military Base Name Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult indicates a significant majority of the general public is either indifferent or in favor of leaving military bases named after Confederate military leaders unchanged, or removing them. In an effort to shed light on the perspectives of the descendants of these leaders, \u2588\u2588\u2588 tracked down 16 relatives of eight Confederate military leaders whose names are associated with military bases or other prominent facilities.\n\nThe relatives, hailing from various political, geographical, and racial backgrounds, hold surprisingly consistent, though not unanimous, views. Most believe it is time for a change, with many advocating for the removal of their ancestors' names from all military monuments, buildings, streets, ships, planes, or paraphernalia. A minority, however, argue their ancestors deserve to be honored. Some family members hold diametrically opposing views, with some not speaking to each other over the issue.\n\nThe Army bases in question are Fort Rucker in Alabama, Forts Benning and Gordon in Georgia, Fort Polk and Camp Beauregard in Louisiana, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas, and Forts A.P. Hill, Pickett, and Lee in Virginia. These bases were established after the Civil War, primarily during two key military buildups to wage World War I and World War II.\n\nAt the time, many elected leaders from the South, including powerful members of Congress, were avowed racists and sought to recast the Civil War as not about slavery but a defense of states' rights. Only recently has the Army expressed a willingness to reconsider the names, following a deadly mass shooting in a Black church in South Carolina by a white supremacist in 2015.\n\nFor many descendants, there is no doubt about what needs to be done. Mimi Kirk, the great-great-great granddaughter of General John Brown Gordon, wants Georgia's Fort Gordon renamed to avoid honoring a leading white supremacist. Others, such as Tim Hill, 53, oppose changing the post in Virginia named for his direct ancestor, A.P. Hill, arguing that his ancestor fought for what he believed in and the fight was not about slavery but \"Northern aggression.\"\n\nOthers, like Milbry Polk, 66, whose forebear Gen. Leonidas Polk is honored with Fort Polk in Louisiana, argue for a reassessment of historical figures, advocating for role models from various backgrounds, including Native Americans, women, and African Americans.\n\nThe issue remains a contentious one, with many descendants still grappling with how their ancestor's legacy should be remembered. Stephen M. \"Sam\" Hood, Hood's cousin, maintains that it is instructive to look at the individuals who are honored, not the causes for which they served for a brief period of their lives or careers. However, most of the descendants who have shared their views believe it is past time to honor only Americans whom everyone can agree are deserving.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Instructs Federal Prosecutors to Monitor State and Local Shutdown Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr has directed federal prosecutors to be vigilant for overly restrictive state and local shutdown orders that may infringe upon individuals' constitutional rights. In a memo issued on Monday, Barr acknowledged that some restrictions are necessary and proper for combating the coronavirus pandemic, but others could potentially exceed constitutional and statutory protections.\n\nThe memo comes as some states begin to lift stay-at-home orders, while others remain cautious. Protests have emerged in certain parts of the country due to the surge in unemployment rates resulting from the shutdown orders.\n\nBarr stated that if a state or local ordinance exceeds the appropriate authority to halt the spread of COVID-19 and becomes an excessive infringement on constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may need to intervene in federal court.\n\nThe Justice Department previously filed a statement of interest in a Mississippi lawsuit, supporting a church after local officials attempted to prevent Holy Week services in a parking lot where people were sitting in their cars.\n\nIn an interview on Hugh Hewitt's radio program, Barr expressed concern that some state orders were \"disturbingly close to house arrest.\" He emphasized that while the objective was to flatten the curve of COVID-19 cases, that goal has largely been achieved, and states should now employ \"more targeted approaches.\"\n\nBarr's memo appoints the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan to coordinate the department's efforts to monitor state and local policies and take action if necessary.\n\n\"Many policies that would be unthinkable in regular times have become commonplace in recent weeks,\" the memo states. \"We do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public, but the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.\"\n\nPresident Trump was asked about Barr's directive during a Monday press briefing. Trump responded, \"Well, you'd have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I think he wants to see\u2014like everybody\u2014he wants to see people get back and he wants to see people get back to work. He doesn't want people to be held up when there's no reason for doing it. In some cases, perhaps it's too strict.

Trump stated, \"We're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind.\"\n\nTrump further elaborated, \"And the something else in mind, you know, people can't believe it, people can't believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on\u2014it's inconceivable. There's something going on.\"\n\nThe businessman has previously raised questions about Obama's birthplace and suggested he is not a Christian. In 2011, the White House responded to Trump's \"birther\" claims by releasing the president's long-form birth certificate.\n\nDuring an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show, Trump argued that Obama intentionally pursues ignorance on the topic of Islamism. Although Trump considered the president to be clueless, he also gave consideration to conspiracy theories that the president has ulterior motives.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who think maybe he doesn't want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesn't want to know about it,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Obama's handling of terrorism and, in February, accused the president of apologizing to Muslims after he visited a mosque to combat rhetoric against Muslim-Americans.\n\nSeveral journalists highlighted Trump's comments on Monday, a day after Omar Mateen killed 49 people and injured dozens more in a shooting at an Orlando, Fla., nightclub.\n\nTrump's comments on Monday were met with criticism on social media, with some comparing his statements to a Democratic suggesting 9/11 was an inside job on the day after the terrorist attacks.\n\nDuring the \"Today\" show interview, Trump stated, \"The president doesn't know [about radical Islamic terrorism] because he certainly does not do much about it in terms of intelligence, in terms of intelligence gathering.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that the president knows, if you want to know the truth. He won't even use the term 'radical Islamic terrorism.' I think he thinks that everyone's just a sweetheart,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He won't even use the term 'radical Islamic terrorism,' which I think is insulting to our country and it's insulting to everybody,\" he added.",

They also assert that they would perform better if given the opportunity to run the House.\n\nMr. Collins described the charges as \"meritless\" and vowed to clear his name. He suggested he did not want to become a distraction in the high-stakes election this fall, where control of Congress is at stake.\n\n\"Democrats are laser-focused on taking back the House, electing Nancy Pelosi Speaker, and then launching impeachment proceedings against President Trump,\" Mr. Collins said in a statement. \"They would not do anything more than to elect an 'Impeach Trump' Democrat in this District, which is something that neither our country or my party can afford.\"\n\nInitially, Mr. Collins stated he planned to stay on the ballot after the news first broke.

Carlson accused several CNN hosts, contributors, and guests of attempting to convince viewers that the Steele dossier was \"totally irrelevant\" to the FISA warrant application.\n\nCarlson specifically targeted CNN primetime anchor Don Lemon, who had previously claimed that the report purportedly found the Russia probe's origins \"legally sound\" and \"unbiased.\" In response, Carlson argued that Lemon was irresponsibly doubling down on a false narrative, as the report did not express what the CNN host claimed it did.\n\nSenator John Kennedy (R-LA) also weighed in, stating that reading the DOJ IG report made him feel as if he had taken acid. In a recent clip, CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo mocked President Trump for claiming he is a \"victim\" in the FISA firestorm, to which Carlson responded by suggesting that Cuomo had not read the report himself.\n\nCarlson also singled out CNN anchor and former Obama administration staffer Jim Sciutto, who in a 2018 tweet claimed the FBI would \"further corroborate information in the [Steele] dossier... before using such intel to justify the FISA warrant.\" Carlson argued that Sciutto was incorrect \"at best\" and had not yet issued a correction.\n\nThe host also criticized NBC News intelligence correspondent Ken Dilanian, who tweeted in 2018 that Trump is \"wrong about Carter Page, the dossier and the FISA warrant.\" Carlson remarked that Dilanian and his sources in the intelligence community were \"completely wrong.\"\n\nOverall, Carlson's criticism of CNN and other media outlets centers on their coverage of the DOJ IG report, which he claims has been misleading and inaccurate in portraying the origins and legitimacy of the Russia probe.",
    " Title: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich Criticizes President Obama's Immigration Policy as Unconstitutional Executive Action\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich has criticized President Barack Obama's immigration policy, characterizing it as an unconstitutional executive action rather than a new government program. In an opinion piece for CNN and his Gingrich Productions website, Gingrich argues that the president's policy, as outlined in a White House memo, includes several new programs without Congressional approval, budget appropriation, or spending authorization.\n\nIn his prime-time address on Thursday, President Obama described a plan that prioritizes the deportation of felons, criminals, and gang members over other undocumented immigrants. However, Gingrich notes that the White House's real policy, as outlined in the memo, is a 17-point plan that includes a deferred action program to provide work permits for at least three years to eligible illegal immigrants and establishes criteria to keep people exempt from deportation.\n\nAccording to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will create a deferred action program to give work permits to eligible illegal immigrants and establish criteria to keep people exempt from deportation. The DHS will have to employ thousands of bureaucrats to process those who \"come forward and register, submit biometric data, pass background checks, pay fees, and show that their child was born before the date of the announcement.\" Applicants will also have to prove they have been in the country for at least five years and will have to pay taxes.\n\nGingrich argues that the policy is not just a pause on deportations for millions of people in the United States illegally, but a new program that hands out work authorizations and processes more paperwork than many state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices. He also notes that while the president said his executive action will offer relief to a narrow number of people, the policy memo states that DHS will \"direct all of its enforcement resources at pursuing people who are 'national security threats, serious criminals, and recent border crossers.'\"\n\nGingrich also criticizes the president for assuring the nation that his actions are lawful and the same kind taken by presidents over the past half-century. Gingrich argues that Obama does not have any congressional sanction like his predecessors and that his actions are \"an order of magnitude larger\" than those of previous presidents.\n\nGingrich also compares the president's actions to those of Obamacare co-architect Jonathan Gruber, who infamously stated that the Obama administration depended on \"the stupidity of the American voter\" to enable the healthcare reform plan. Gingrich describes the address as \"a Gruber speech, and was designed to sound acceptable, even if it was a lie, a reference to Obamacare co-architect Jonathan Gruber's statements on how the Obama administration depended on 'the stupidity of the American voter' to enable the healthcare reform plan.\"\n\nGingrich concludes by stating that the president has described on video 22 times how he does not have the legal and Constitutional authority to enact the reforms he announced Thursday night. In 2011, Gingrich notes, Obama said that there are \"laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President.\" However, Gingrich argues that this has all changed, and \"it's a shame he apparently thinks, like Gruber, that Americans are all so stupid we won't figure out he's not telling us the truth today.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Christian Leaders Urge Recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital, but Embassy Move Delayed\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 60 influential U.S. Christian leaders have sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. Embassy there. However, a White House official told Reuters that President Trump will not move the embassy now due to concerns about complicating a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.\n\nThe U.S. has a long diplomatic history in the Holy Land, with the first U.S. consulate established in 1844 inside the walls of the Old City, near the Jaffa Gate. The building is now used by the Christian Information Center. In 1912, the consulate moved to a location on Prophet's Street, and then to a location where the U.S. representative to the Palestinian Authority now sits. This consulate reports directly to the State Department rather than the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. A U.S. government building providing consular services for U.S. citizens is about a 10-minute drive away, while the embassy remains in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe question remains whether the embassy will ever move to Jerusalem. In 1995, David Parsons, media director of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem (ICEJ), helped draft the Jerusalem Embassy Act. \"We actually met with [Arizona] Senator John Kyl up on Capitol Hill one day and we gauged that he was serious\u2026that moving the embassy was an issue that he wanted to do on principle. It was not politics. It was principle, and he asked us to draft a bill,\" Parsons told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News.\n\nHowever, the bill was changed as it went through Congress, and it included a presidential waiver authority, which allowed the president to suspend the bill if he certified it was in U.S. national security interests. \"It's fear that has kept us out,\" Parsons explained. \"It's been more than two decades since successive presidents have signed that waiver.\" The current waiver expires in June.\n\nIsraeli leaders hope that one day includes relocating the embassy. \"Israel reunited Jerusalem 50 years ago, in 1967. But the connection with the Jewish people to Jerusalem spiritually goes back 2,000 years,\" Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA), told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News. \"And our claim, our presence in Jerusalem, has been here for decades\u2026Jews have been streaming back to their ancient capital for years. And the movement of the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is an American recognition of the special ties of Jerusalem to the Jewish people. It may be symbolic, but it goes to the core of the identity of Israel.\"\n\n\"I think the U.S. moving the embassy to Jerusalem is the right thing to do. It's \u2013 it's way overdue, and, of course, it would be a blessing to \u2013 to the U.S,\" Parsons said. In 1950, Israel declared Jerusalem as its capital, and in 1967, it captured the Old City and the eastern part of Jerusalem. Then in 1980, Israel passed the Basic Law Jerusalem, incorporating all of the land captured in 1967 as its capital. That's when most embassies left Jerusalem for Tel Aviv, and ICEJ moved in.\n\n\"To represent Christians from all over the world who want to stand in solidarity with Israel, help secure it and help it reach its destiny and also want to stand in solidarity with their claim and connection to Jerusalem,\" Parsons said. And whether or not the U.S. Embassy eventually moves to Jerusalem, Parsons sees a glorious future for the city. \"This is that promised Son of David, the Messiah, [who] will rule and reign over the world in peace and righteousness. We believe that's Jesus, but I think a house of prayer for all people, that exalted throne of the Messiah during the Messianic age. This is Israel's ultimate destiny and Jerusalem's.\"",
    " Title: Sheriff Joe Arpaio Challenges Obama's Immigration Policy in Court, Claims Constitutional Violation\n\nArticle:\n\nArizona County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on illegal immigration, argued in a U.S. District Court on Monday that President Barack Obama's immigration policy, which aims to protect nearly 5 million people from deportation, is unconstitutional. The hearing marked the first courtroom challenge to Obama's immigration actions.\n\nArpaio and his attorney, Larry Klayman, presented their case before U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C. During the hearing, Howell seemed skeptical of the lawsuit, questioning whether Arpaio has legal standing to challenge Obama's action. She suggested that Congress is in a better position to question the president's authority rather than a federal court.\n\nA lawyer for the Obama administration called Arpaio's case a \"political dispute\" that should be dismissed. Howell, an Obama nominee, said she would issue a ruling soon. Klayman and Arpaio argue that the president violated the Constitution by bypassing Congress and making drastic changes to immigration programs.\n\nKlayman, a conservative who has previously targeted the president, has alleged that Obama falsely claimed U.S. citizenship. In October, Klayman petitioned the Homeland Security Department to start deportation proceedings against Obama.\n\nUnder the immigration program, the Homeland Security Department would prioritize the removal of immigrants who present threats to national security, public safety, or border security. DHS officials could deport someone if an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director determined that removing the person would serve an important federal interest.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Klayman and Arpaio argue that the administration's policy change encourages more illegal immigration and leads to increased crime, burdening law enforcement. The Justice Department argues that this theory is speculative and unsubstantiated. Obama's program places greater emphasis on removing criminal aliens and recent border crossers, the government countered.\n\nEvidence in the case includes a set of Arpaio press releases and letters to Homeland Security officials that claim more than 35 percent of immigrants living in Maricopa County illegally who wound up in Arpaio's jails in 2014 were repeat offenders, indicating, in the sheriff's view, that DHS has done a poor job of deporting criminals. Jennifer D. Elzea, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says that as a matter of policy, ICE does not comment on pending litigation. ICE, a DHS agency, can and does release immigrants who have been arrested on criminal charges, including those who have yet to be convicted, for a variety of reasons. In some instances, immigrants are released from immigration jails because they are from countries that won't provide travel documents or otherwise are not likely to be deported within a reasonable time.",
    " Title: Central American Migrant Caravan Reaches Tijuana as US Deploys Troops to Border\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of Central American migrants, including members of the LGBTQ community, have reached the Mexican border city of Tijuana, having separated from a larger caravan of 5,000 people in Mexico City. The smaller group, which numbered approximately 400, traveled by bus, unlike the majority of the larger group who have been making their journey on foot.\n\nThe 5,000 migrants, who are fleeing persecution, poverty, and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, began their journey from the city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras on October 13, a distance of approximately 4,350km (2,700 miles) from Tijuana.\n\nThe smaller group, which reached Tijuana on Tuesday, joined a smaller group of about 80 migrants who arrived at the border city on Sunday. The larger group is expected to arrive at the border in the coming days.\n\nThe smaller group, which includes many LGBTQ individuals, reportedly parted ways with the main caravan after weeks of what they described as discriminatory treatment by local residents and fellow travelers.\n\nDespite a harder US stance against them, the migrants have stated their intention to continue their journey to claim asylum. The journey poses numerous dangers, including attacks by criminal gangs, which is why many migrants feel safer traveling in numbers.\n\nUS Defense Secretary James Mattis is scheduled to visit the US-Mexico border on Wednesday, his first visit since thousands of troops were deployed. In response to the approaching caravan, up to 9,000 troops have been ordered to the border by President Donald Trump, who has referred to the caravan as an \"invasion.\"\n\nUS authorities closed down several lanes of traffic at two border crossings from Tijuana to California on Tuesday to install barbed wire fencing and barricades to reinforce security. There is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they express fear of violence in their home countries.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation temporarily barring migrants who enter illegally from claiming asylum. The caravans became a campaign issue in the US mid-term elections that took place last week, with Mr. Trump warning without evidence that the caravan includes \"gang members,\" \"hardened criminals,\" and even \"Middle Eastern terrorists.\"",
    " Title: Trump Calls for Samantha Bee's Firing Following Crude Remark About Ivanka Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump called for the termination of comedian Samantha Bee from her cable television program on Friday, following her use of a vulgar term about his daughter and White House advisor Ivanka Trump on her show \"Full Frontal.\" The incident marked the latest episode in a week-long debate over the language used by two television personalities, which has become a symbol of the country's political divide.\n\nOn Tuesday, Walt Disney Co's ABC network canceled a revival of \"Roseanne\" after its star, Roseanne Barr, made a racist remark in a post on Twitter, comparing a former top Obama administration official to an ape. Trump criticized ABC and Bob Iger, chief executive officer of Disney, on Twitter, but did not address the content of Barr's comments.\n\nBee's use of a crude term for the female anatomy to describe Ivanka Trump on \"Full Frontal\" on Wednesday, while discussing the president's controversial immigration policies, prompted Trump's criticism. \"Why aren't they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show?\" Trump said on Twitter on Friday. \"A total double standard but that's OK, we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!\"\n\nBoth Bee and the TBS cable network, which airs the show, apologized on Thursday. \"I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night,\" Bee said on Twitter. \"It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's remarks on Friday, TBS spokesman Sal Petruzzi said there would be no further comment beyond the earlier apologies. State Farm Insurance suspended its commercials, and Autotrader also suspended its sponsorship, calling Bee's comments \"offensive\" in a statement.\n\nTrump's presidential candidacy was thrown into crisis in 2016 after a tape emerged of him boasting about being able to grab women by their genitalia because of his star status. He had made those comments as he waited to film a segment for the TV program, \"Access Hollywood,\" in 2005.\n\nAfter \"Roseanne\" was canceled, the White House said the president would not defend Barr's comments but pointed to alleged media bias against the TV show, which portrays a working-class American family. The program, which originally aired from 1988 to 1997, has drawn praise from Trump since its return. Its reboot featured Barr portraying a Trump voter facing off against her sister, an ardent opponent of the president, and tackled other issues reflecting America's political divide.\n\nTBS is owned by Time Warner Inc, which is seeking to merge with AT&T Inc in a move opposed by the Trump administration. Disney is seeking to merge with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.",
    " Title: Trump Shifts Focus from North Carolina Rally Chants to Criticism of Liberal Lawmakers\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday attempted to redirect political pressure from his supporters' chants at a North Carolina rally, focusing instead on the comments made by four liberal lawmakers regarding U.S. policy and Israel.\n\nDuring his departure from the White House en route to his New Jersey golf club, Trump stated, \"They say things about Israel that's so bad I'm not even going to repeat them. They can't get away with that act.\"\n\nThe controversy arose after a Greenville crowd chanted, \"Send her back!\" on Wednesday, referring to Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee who became a U.S. citizen before being elected to Congress from Minnesota.\n\nTrump has been critical of Omar, who is part of a quartet of freshman Democrats known as \"The Squad.\" He has portrayed all four as the new \"extreme\" face of the Democratic Party. In a Sunday tweet, he told them to \"go back\" to their countries if they're unhappy. All four are citizens, and Omar is the only one who was born outside of the U.S.\n\nTrump disavowed the chant on Thursday, but since then, he has focused on the liberal lawmakers' comments rather than the criticism that he is stoking an ugly side of his base ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\"I don't care if it's good or bad about politics. Many people say it's good. I don't know if it's good or bad,\" Trump said. \"I can tell you this\u2014you can't talk that way about our country, not while I'm president.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the liberal lawmakers are exercising their First Amendment rights when they criticize U.S. policy, Trump responded, \"We have First Amendment rights, also. We can certainly feel and say what we want.\"\n\nTrump also stated that he did not take advice from First Lady Melania Trump or his daughter, Ivanka, on how to respond to the chants, denying reports to the contrary as \"fake news.\"",
    " Title: Polls Show Enduring Opposition to Obamacare, With Critics Citing Broken Promises and Rising Costs\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo recent polls have revealed a persistent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The Washington Post/ABC News poll, published yesterday, showed a 30 to 55 majority deeming President Obama's presidency a failure, with a significant number of respondents citing the president's divisive leadership and the implementation of Obamacare as key factors. The survey also reported a dismal 38 to 56 presidential approval rating on the implementation of Obamacare, and a majority opposed to the law itself, despite the poll's question wording that omits any mention of 'Obamacare' or the 'Affordable Care Act.'\n\nA similar trend is observed in a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll, with support for the president's signature domestic accomplishment significantly outweighed by opposition. Healthcare industry expert Bob Laszewski argues that the law may have been largely out of the news for the last few months, but a fresh round of cancellations and the coming open enrollment period are about to change that.\n\nThe 2015 Obamacare open-enrollment, set to begin in November, is expected to be problematic, according to Laszewski. The HealthCare.gov backroom is not yet built, a year and counting after it should have been. The number of people enrolled in Obamacare is currently unknown due to the lack of a government to insurance company accounting system.\n\nLarge businesses expect to pay between 4 and 5 percent more for health-care benefits for their employees in 2015, according to employer surveys conducted this summer. Few employers plan to stop providing benefits with the advent of federal health insurance mandates, but a third say they are considering cutting or reducing subsidies for employee family members. Employees are also paying more each year in out-of-pocket health care expenses, according to the surveys.\n\nNumerous polls have consistently found that roughly twice as many Americans say they've been personally hurt by Obamacare than helped. However, most consumers have responded that they have not been impacted one way or another. This trend is expected to change for millions in the coming months and years.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that higher costs and reduced benefits are on the way for many who are among the large majority of Americans receiving health coverage through their employers. The White House knew this was coming, and Senate Democrats voted down a Republican effort to reinforce the president's \"keep your plan\" promise, which continues to unravel for consumers for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition to Obamacare remains strong, with critics citing broken promises and rising costs as key factors. The upcoming open enrollment period is expected to bring further challenges and confusion, with millions of people potentially facing higher rates and the need to change their plans.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Criticizes President Trump in Washington Post Op-Ed, Trump Responds on Twitter\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, who will be sworn in to the Senate on Thursday, began the new year with a public condemnation of President Donald Trump in a Washington Post op-ed published Tuesday night. In the article, Romney criticized Trump for lacking the character and principles the office requires.\n\n\"When he won the election, I hoped he would rise to the occasion,\" Romney wrote. \"But, on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\"\n\nAs expected, the president responded to Romney's criticism on Twitter Wednesday morning. \"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast!\" he wrote. \"Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!\"\n\nSome have speculated that Romney's decision to speak out against the president's style, while still praising many of his policies and his appointment of conservative judges and Cabinet members, may mean he is positioning himself as a potential replacement to Jeff Flake, the Republican who most often publicly criticized the president.\n\nIn 2016, Romney openly criticized Trump, calling the candidate a \"phony\" and \"fraud.\" Trump also criticized Romney, calling him a \"failed presidential candidate\" who \"choked like a dog.\" After Trump's election, Romney changed his tune, and while he still said he thought the president was not \"a role model for my grandkids on the basis of his personal style,\" he praised some of the president's policy decisions and expressed interest in joining his administration. Trump also publicly supported Romney in his bid for the Senate.",
    " Title: Trump Pursues Bipartisan Tax Reform, Suggests Higher Taxes for Wealthy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is advocating for bipartisanship in his latest push for tax reform, meeting with a group of moderate members of Congress from both parties on Wednesday, September 13. The meeting follows Trump's recent deal with Democratic leaders to raise the debt ceiling, a move that has sparked controversy among some Republicans.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump suggested that wealthy Americans may face higher taxes under a new tax plan, stating, \"If they have to go higher, they'll go higher, frankly.\" This statement could potentially create a rift with Republicans, who generally oppose tax hikes. However, Trump's eagerness to strike a deal on tax reform may indicate a willingness to partner with Democrats.\n\nAs part of his tax push, Trump also scheduled a private dinner at the White House with congressional Democratic leaders, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California. The meetings come just one week after Trump made a deal to raise the debt ceiling with Schumer and Pelosi, a move that angered some Republicans and disrupted their legislative strategy through the end of the year.\n\nTrump appeared confident about an agreement over taxes, stating, \"The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan. We are looking for the middle class and we are looking for jobs \u2013 jobs being the economy.\" Trump's tax efforts are linked to the need for recovery efforts from hurricanes Harvey and Irma, as he tweeted, \"With Irma and Harvey devastation, Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before. Go Congress, go!\"\n\nSome Republicans who generally oppose tax hikes have not rejected Trump's idea of higher taxes for the wealthy outright. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, \"I'm willing to look at everything in trying to make sure that we get hard-working American taxpayers the most relief that we can.\"\n\nA tax overhaul is a key promise for Trump and other Republicans. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., stated, \"They want to see a pelt on the wall.\" He added, \"If it\u2019s not this, I don\u2019t know what it is.\" Despite Trump's enthusiasm for a deal, skeptics note that neither the Trump administration nor Congress have a specific tax plan yet.\n\nTrump's bipartisan push this week began at dinner Tuesday night at the White House with a group of senators in both parties. The White House stated that Trump and his guests discussed \"advancing the administration\u2019s legislative priorities, in particular tax cuts for the middle class.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who has clashed with Trump on some issues, said, \"We're going to do it no matter what.\" However, he added, \"We'd love to have the Democrats supporting and working with us in a constructive way on tax reform.\"\n\nThis article is based on information from the Associated Press and does not include personal opinions, political bias, or subjective language.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Efforts to Include Citizenship Question in 2020 Census May Affect Accuracy and Districting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is pursuing legal options to potentially include a citizenship question in the 2020 census, despite the Supreme Court's previous blocking of the question. The administration's efforts, according to legal and political experts, could lead to an undercount of residents in Democratic-leaning areas, which could benefit the Republican party in redrawing voting districts across the country.\n\nThe latest development came on Sunday evening, with the U.S. Department of Justice installing a new team of lawyers to handle the ongoing litigation that has been ongoing for over a year. Thomas Wolf, a lawyer who focuses on census issues at the Brennan Center for Justice, stated, \"Even if the question is [taken] off, if people are tweeting as if it may be a real possibility, it continues to raise fears and depress the count.\"\n\nThe U.S. Constitution requires the government to count all residents, regardless of their legal status, every ten years. The information collected becomes the basis for voting maps and distributing some $800 billion in federal funds each year. It is illegal for the Census Bureau to share information about individuals with law enforcement or immigration authorities.\n\nThe idea of asking residents about their citizenship status has nonetheless stoked fears that the survey would become a tool for the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. The president and his allies have argued that it is important to know about citizenship status, and characterized the question as something that should not draw controversy.\n\nA poll earlier this year showed 66% of Americans support the inclusion of the citizenship question. However, demographers, advocacy groups, corporations, and even the Census Bureau's own staff have said the citizenship question threatens to undermine the survey. Communities with high immigrant and Latino populations could have low response rates, potentially benefiting non-Hispanic whites, a core part of Trump's support, and helping Republicans gain seats in Congress and state legislatures, critics have said.\n\nThe question seemed dead in June, when the Supreme Court blocked it, saying the administration had given a \"contrived\" rationale for its inclusion. However, the high court left open the possibility that the administration could offer a plausible rationale. Department of Justice lawyers said on Friday that they were exploring other explanations. Trump also said he may try to force it into the survey through an executive order.\n\nLegal experts immediately slapped down the ideas. It will be hard to convince justices that a new explanation is not also contrived, and an executive order would not override the Supreme Court decision or undo other court orders blocking the citizenship question, they said. Thomas Saenz, the president and general counsel of MALDEF, a Latino rights group pursuing one of the cases against the administration, stated, \"Our government is not a dictatorship.\"\n\nTrump also said on Friday that although census forms are already being printed, the government could later produce \"an addendum.\" It is not clear how that might work, but census experts said it would be an unprecedented disruption to a process that has been in motion for years. An addendum would also likely be challenged in courts for running afoul of various administrative laws.\n\nOn Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion to prevent the citizenship question from being added. In the meantime, attention surrounding the legal debacle may already be hurting the census and helping Trump achieve his goals, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \"The longer he has this conversation, the worse it is for an accurate census count,\" she said.",
    " Title: U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Demands Action Against Cuba and Bolivia for Disrupting Political Prisoners Event, Causing Property Damage\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has demanded action from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres following disruptions caused by the Bolivian and Cuban delegations during a U.S. event highlighting the plight of political prisoners in Cuba. The event, titled \"Jailed for What? The plight of Cuba\u2019s political prisoners,\" took place in the U.N.'s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) chamber on Tuesday.\n\nThe event descended into chaos as diplomats from the two countries, including Bolivian Ambassador Sacha Llorenti, disrupted the event by banging on tables and shouting slogans. Speakers, including former prisoners and relatives of those currently imprisoned under the communist regime, struggled to be heard over the noise.\n\nIn a letter sent to Guterres on Friday and obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, Haley described the behavior of the Cuban and Bolivian diplomats as \"outrageous\" and called for action from the Secretary-General. The letter states, \"Due to the outrageous behavior of the Cuban and Bolivian U.N. delegations, this diplomatic event became a mob scene, and resulted in significant damage to U.N. property.\"\n\nHaley called for Guterres to condemn the unprofessional conduct of the Cuban and Bolivian diplomats and require the two delegations to pay for the property damage they caused. Initially, the U.N. stated that the U.S. would be contacted to pay for the damage to desks and earphones, but U.N. officials later said that the U.N. itself would bear the cost. Haley deemed this \"completely unacceptable\" considering the U.S. is the largest contributor to the U.N. budget, paying 22 percent of the budget and, therefore, any repair cost as well.\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, Haley was critical of the behavior of the delegations. \"Cuba\u2019s UN delegation destroyed property with their juvenile, unprofessional behavior that was a mockery of diplomacy,\" she said. \"There\u2019s no way the U.N. should pay for those repairs \u2013 with U.S. taxpayers footing 22 percent of that bill. The bill needs to be sent directly to Cuba.\"\n\nThe Cuban Mission has already called for an investigation into the event, stating it was a \"political comedy staged on false arguments and with supporting actors of a dark history at the service of a foreign power.\" The mission also accused the U.S. of subverting the legitimately established constitutional order and of pursuing an interventionist agenda.\n\nStephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that missions must certify that public meetings are consistent with the purposes and principles of the U.N. and are non-commercial in nature. He also stated that it is not the role of U.N. security to remove disruptive delegates unless they pose a physical threat.\n\nHaley welcomed the Cuban call for an investigation and suggested that the U.N. should also investigate the damage and the misconduct by the Cuban and Bolivian delegations, including removing access to the U.N. for those responsible. \"This conduct was an assault on the dignity, ideals, and fundamental purposes of the U.N.,\" she said.\n\nDujarric told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Secretary-General's office had received the letter and was looking into it. The Bolivian and Cuban missions did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The event on Tuesday still went ahead, with speakers yelling over the protesters, but the U.S. stated that the event was delayed after the Cuban delegation refused to allow security to conduct a sweep of the chamber.\n\nHaley, who is stepping down from her role at Turtle Bay in January, has been vocal in standing for the interests of the U.S. and its allies at the U.N. Last week, she criticized the U.N. General Assembly for electing a number of countries with poor human rights records to the controversial Human Rights Council, including Eritrea, Cameroon, Somalia, and Bangladesh. \"This lack of standards continues to undermine the organization and demonstrates again why the United States was right to withdraw from it earlier this year,\" she said.",
    " Title: Rick Perry's 2016 Presidential Campaign: An Analysis of His Exit and the Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nRick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, has announced his withdrawal from the 2016 presidential race. The author of the article expresses disappointment over Perry's decision, attributing it to the preferences of Republican voters, the Republican Party apparatus, and the media's focus on other candidates.\n\nThe author argues that Perry, despite not being particularly skilled at debating and lacking a significant polling boost, was a more qualified candidate than several others in the race. They question whether people genuinely believe Perry is less credible than candidates like Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, or Chris Christie, or that he is less capable of uniting the party and winning the White House.\n\nThe author criticizes the Republican National Committee and media organizations for allowing opinion polls to dictate the candidates' inclusion in debates during a time when public interest in the election is low. They argue that this approach unfairly favors low-polling candidates who can gain attention through unconventional means, such as memorable debate moments or controversial statements.\n\nThe article highlights Texas' success under Perry's governorship, citing its thriving cities, economic recovery, and equitable distribution of economic growth. The author suggests that Texas' record of success, particularly in contrast to the Mormon-Mountain West, offers a compelling narrative that the Republican Party should share with the nation.\n\nThe author criticizes the current debate-centric nature of the presidential race, arguing that being a skilled debater does not necessarily translate to being a successful president. They suggest that the early polling numbers, which led to Perry's exclusion from the main debates, unfairly burdened his campaign.\n\nThe author concludes by expressing their belief that Perry's presidential aspirations were lost due to the whims of the electoral process rather than his own inadequacies. They suggest that Perry's tax plan and record as a campaigner have improved since his previous run in 2012, and that his record as a governor is more credible than those of other candidates, such as Chris Christie, Scott Walker, and Bobby Jindal.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Disparities in Neighborhood Opportunities for Minority Children in U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nResearchers from Brandeis University and Ohio State University have found significant disparities in the neighborhood opportunities for children of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in the United States. The findings, published in the Child Opportunity Index, reveal that about 40 percent of black children and 32 percent of Hispanic children live in the lowest-opportunity neighborhoods in their respective metropolitan areas, compared to just 9 percent of white children.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from diversitydatakids.org, examining various neighborhoods based on socioeconomic indicators such as housing foreclosure rates and access to educational and healthcare facilities. The study shows that minority children are more likely to reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods that lack access to early childhood education centers, parks, health-care facilities, and other essential resources.\n\nWhite children do not experience this debilitating disadvantage even in the cities where they are worst off. The problem is most pronounced for white children in Honolulu, where 23 percent live in the lowest-opportunity neighborhoods. In contrast, 60.3 percent of the Albany metro area's black children and 57.6 percent of Boston's Hispanic children live in the worst neighborhoods.\n\nLiving in disadvantaged neighborhoods can have long-lasting consequences for children, according to a 2008 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study found that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is equivalent to missing a year or more of school, and the negative impact persists even after the child moves out of the area.\n\nThe Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates covered similar research in \"The Case for Reparations,\" focusing on Chicago, one of the most economically and racially segregated major U.S. cities. The average per capita income of Chicago's white neighborhoods is almost three times that of its black neighborhoods. A 2012 study by Harvard sociologist Robert J. Sampson found that a black neighborhood with one of the highest incarceration rates (West Garfield Park) had a rate more than 40 times as high as the white neighborhood with the highest rate (Clearing).\n\nBased on the Child Opportunity Index's data, these neighborhood disparities persist across the nation, placing America's minority children on a worse trajectory at the start of their lives.",
    " Title: Navy Secretary Nominee Philip Bilden Withdraws from Consideration\n\nArticle:\n\nPhilip Bilden, President Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Navy, has withdrawn from consideration for the post, citing concerns about privacy and separating himself from his business interests. This marks the second time a Trump nominee for a military post has withdrawn before confirmation.\n\nBilden, an intelligence officer in the Army Reserve from 1986 to 1996, relocated to Hong Kong to establish an Asian presence for HarbourVest Partners, a global private equity management firm. He recently retired from HarbourVest Partners after 25 years.\n\nEarlier this month, Vincent Viola, a West Point graduate and former airborne officer, also withdrew from consideration to be Secretary of the Army. Viola is the founder of several businesses, including the electronic trading firm Virtu Financial, and owns the National Hockey League's Florida Panthers and is a past chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Viola withdrew due to his inability to navigate the confirmation process and defense department rules concerning family businesses. The Army secretary post remains unfilled.\n\nReports of Bilden's withdrawal had been circulating for days but were denied by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who stated that Bilden was 100% committed to the role. In a statement on Sunday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis confirmed Bilden's decision and stated that he would recommend a new nominee in the coming days.\n\n\"This was a personal decision driven by privacy concerns and significant challenges he faced in separating himself from his business interests,\" Mattis said.\n\nIn his own statement, Bilden said, \"I informed Secretary of Defense Mattis with regret that I respectfully withdraw from consideration as nominee for the 76th secretary of the navy.\" He determined that he would not be able to satisfy Office of Government Ethics requirements without what he called \"undue disruption and materially adverse divestment of my family's private financial interests.\"",
    " Title: House Republican Leadership Scramble: McCarthy Steps Down as Speaker Candidate, No Clear Successor Emerges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has announced he will not run for Speaker of the House, plunging the House Republican Conference into a leadership scramble not seen in more than a decade. The decision leaves the House with no apparent line of succession to power, as Republicans grapple with ideological divisions and an uncertain governing agenda amid several legislative battles in the coming weeks.\n\nMcCarthy's decision, made Thursday afternoon before a planned closed party election, was influenced by a host of factors. He had initially believed he would win the speakership, but was reportedly crippled by the same problems that had dogged former Speaker John Boehner. One of these issues was the creation of the Select Committee on Benghazi, which some Republicans perceived as an attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nAs of now, the general consensus within the House Republican Conference is that there is only one man who can garner the 218 votes needed to be speaker: Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. Ryan has resisted calls to run in the past, but both Boehner and McCarthy have asked him to reconsider. He has canceled his fundraising appearances for the next 48 hours and is considering a bid.\n\nOther names being floated include Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, Mike Conaway and Bill Flores of Texas, John Kline of Minnesota, and Tom Cole of Oklahoma. Some of these lawmakers, most notably the retiring Kline, have been mentioned as caretakers of the office until after the 2016 elections. Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida and Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the two men who ran against McCarthy, are still in the race for the speakership.\n\nWith McCarthy remaining as majority leader, there will be no race for his position or whip. Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Tom Price of Georgia, who had been running for the majority leader job, will have to abandon their campaigns. Reps. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, Pete Sessions of Texas, and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma will all be forced to abandon their campaigns for whip.\n\nFormer Speaker John Boehner had planned to resign effective Oct. 30, but he will now stay on as speaker until Republicans select his successor. Boehner canceled an appearance on NBC's \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" after McCarthy withdrew from consideration.\n\nThe current state of chaos in the House Republican Conference recalls another dark time for the party. In Dec. 1998, during the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton, Louisiana Rep. Bob Livingston plunged the House into chaos by admitting to extramarital affairs and resigning from Congress. Livingston was speaker designate, slated to take the job from the outgoing Newt Gingrich. The admission stunned Capitol Hill, and the country.\n\nThe Republicans will need a unifying force once again, and this process will begin Friday morning when the party retreats to a room in the Capitol basement for a special GOP conference meeting. Party leaders want to get the Republican lawmakers on the same page.\n\n\"If we're going to be strong, we need to be united,\" McCarthy said at a news conference after his announcement. He said the party needs a \"new face,\" and he did not want to win the job with the bare minimum level of support. The conservative House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of roughly 40 Republicans, continues to loom large, having endorsed Webster Wednesday and vowing to vote together in the closed party election.",

The president presented the nation's highest award for public safety officers to six police officers who confronted the gunman in the Dayton shooting, and five civilians who helped others during the El Paso shooting.\n\nIn his address at the White House, Trump acknowledged the tragic events that occurred on August 3 in El Paso, where a white supremacist opened fire, killing 22 people and wounding 27 others. He also addressed the Dayton shooting on August 4, where a shooter killed nine people and injured 34 others.\n\n\"On Saturday, August 3rd, at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, the soulless and bigoted monster killed 22 innocent people and wounded 27 others. It was a racist attack motivated by pure evil,\" Trump said. \"The next day in Dayton, Ohio, a vile and wicked murderer stole nine lives and injured 34 others.\"\n\nIn Dayton, officers confronted the shooter within 30 seconds, a swift response credited with preventing more deaths. The officers awarded the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor were Sgt. William Knight and Officers Brian Rolfes, Jeremy Campbell, Vincent Carter, Ryan Nabel, and David Denlinger. All returned fire on the gunman, but it was unclear which officer or officers fired the bullets that killed Connor Betts, 24.\n\nTrump also honored five civilians who helped others as a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso. The five \u2014 Robert Evans, Gilbert Serna, Marisela Luna, Angelica Silva, and Chris Grant \u2014 risked their lives to help others. Grant, who was still recovering from a pair of gunshot wounds, was represented by his mother, Minnie Grant.\n\nGrant threw bottles and other merchandise at the gunman, Patrick Crusius, 21, to distract him and prevent him from shooting others. Trump highlighted Grant's actions, stating, \"Chris Grant was picking out snacks for his kids when he suddenly saw the murderer firing at innocent shoppers a few aisles away from him. Chris grabbed \u2014 listen to this \u2014 soda bottles and anything else in front of him and began hurling them at the gunman, distracting him from the other shoppers and causing the shooter to turn toward Chris and fire at Chris.\"\n\nTrump praised the heroes, stating, \"In the moments of darkness, danger, and despair, God calls the bravest to action. These 11 individuals answered the call. They stared down evil. They put love of neighbor above life itself, and we are blessed by their courage.\"\n\nThe twin shootings have sparked renewed national discussion on gun control, with Democrats and mayors from cities affected by mass shootings, including Dayton, pressuring the Senate and White House to act on House bills calling for stricter background checks. The president has at times expressed support for tougher background checks but has also questioned their value and praised the NRA since the latest mass shootings.",
    " Title: Iran's Nuclear Program Expansion: A Look at the Centrifuge Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent news conference, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the expansion of Iran's nuclear program, suggesting that the current number of centrifuges, estimated at 19,000, was a result of the program's growth during the Obama administration.\n\nAccording to Kerry, in 2003, Iran had 164 centrifuges, an offer that was not taken by the Bush administration. He stated that since then, the number of centrifuges has grown significantly. Analysts suggest that approximately 74% of the current centrifuges were installed since the Obama-Biden administration took office.\n\nBy late 2007, Iran reportedly possessed about 3,000 centrifuges. Over the course of the Bush administration's final 12 to 15 months, it is estimated that Iran added to, but did not fully double, the number of centrifuges it had installed. This would mean that roughly 25% of the current total of centrifuges had been installed when the Bush-Cheney era ended.\n\nSecretary Kerry's concise history of the Iranian nuclear program, which encompassed only the years 2003 and 2013, omitted significant details. Determining exactly when the regime crossed a given technical threshold can be difficult, given the opacity of the government and the complex of commercial, military, and scientific institutions that have contributed to the program over the last two decades.\n\nIn interviews before leaving Geneva, Kerry expanded on his theme, telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, \"You can't always start where you want to wind up.\" Kerry's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, stated that the administration has not questioned the fact that Iran has made progress on enrichment and developing a nuclear weapon, and that this is one of the reasons why they stepped up sanctions over the past couple of years.\n\nSecretary Kerry is scheduled to testify before Congress on Iran in a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Dec. 10, an opportunity to provide more clarity on the matter. When confronted with the notion that at least 70% of the expansion in Iran's centrifuge program took place on President Obama's watch, Psaki countered that the administration is focused on halting and rolling back the progress of Iran's program and working towards a comprehensive agreement to bring an end to it.",
    " Title: Senator Jeff Merkley Announces Support for Iran Nuclear Deal, Narrowing Vote Gap for President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon has announced his intention to vote in support of the Iran nuclear deal, bringing the number of senators publicly favoring the agreement to 31. This development places President Barack Obama just three votes short of securing the necessary support to protect the pact in Congress.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, Senator Merkley expressed his belief that the accord represents \"the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\" The Iran nuclear deal involves easing economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.\n\nWith Merkley's support, the Senate now has 31 senators publicly in favor of the deal. Barring defections, Obama needs three more votes from 13 Senate Democrats who have yet to declare their position. If Obama can secure 41 Senate votes by gaining the support of most of the remaining Democrats, the Senate may not vote on the agreement at all.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress has until September 17 to pass a resolution disapproving the deal reached in July between six world powers and Iran. President Obama has pledged to veto that resolution if it reaches his desk.\n\nWhile Republicans have been united in their opposition to the deal, only two Democratic senators - Charles Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey - have joined them so far. Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, is expected to announce his decision on Tuesday. Among other Democrats yet to disclose a position are Maryland's Ben Cardin and New Jersey's Cory Booker.\n\nThe only uncertain Senate Republican vote is that of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who remains undecided and is expected to make her decision after September 7.\n\nIn a statement on his website, Senator Merkley outlined his reasons for supporting the deal, while acknowledging \"significant shortcomings\" that require addressing with \"a massive intelligence program\" and monitoring. Merkley expressed concerns about the deal's allowance for Iran to import conventional arms after five years and ballistic missile technology after eight years, as well as the lack of restrictions on how Iran can use money it reclaims when sanctions are lifted.\n\nHowever, Merkley rejected a proposal from deal opponents to renegotiate the accord for better terms. If the U.S. rejects the deal and Iran resumes its nuclear program, \"the United States would be viewed by the international community as undermining a strong framework for peacefully blocking a potential Iranian bomb,\" Merkley stated.\n\nWhile the Republican-controlled House has enough votes to pass a resolution rejecting the deal, it remains unclear whether the Senate does. Assuming all 54 Senate Republicans oppose the accord, they would need support from six Democrats to get the 60 votes necessary to advance a resolution.",
    " Title: Republican Strategist's Predictions on Trump's Reelection and Impeachment Proceedings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn April 2018, political analyst and commentator Mark McKinnon, in a piece titled \"Trump 2020 Campaign Forecast: 99 Percent Chance of Thunder and Lightning,\" predicted that the impeachment of President Donald Trump could coincide with his reelection campaign. This prediction was based on the potential for a \"nation divided\" and the \"ultimate stress test\" on American democracy.\n\nFast forward to September 2019, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump, leading to renewed interest in McKinnon's prediction. In a follow-up piece titled \"Will Trump's Reelection Campaign Collide with Impeachment?\", McKinnon cited comments from veteran GOP strategist Roger Stone and a report from Axios, which suggested that Trump would run for reelection while playing the \"victim card\" if impeached but not convicted.\n\nSince Pelosi's announcement, McKinnon has received a series of messages from the Trump campaign and allied GOP organizations, which appear to be operationalizing the strategic concepts mentioned in McKinnon's pieces. These messages encourage supporters to turn impeachment into a campaign advantage, play the victim card, and exploit the circumstances to raise funds.\n\nThe messages assume that, as a Republican, McKinnon will overlook and excuse Trump's behavior, a presumption that troubles him. He states, \"I am proud to be an American who values the Constitution, separation of powers, and the well-being of our nation before my party.\"\n\nMcKinnon's renewed interest in the potential collision of Trump's reelection campaign and impeachment proceedings has led to questions about the future of the Republican Party and the nation. He wonders if Republican elected leaders and voters will stand with Trump no matter what, even if the evidence proves he violated his oath of office. He also questions whether the country is heading towards a monumental constitutional crisis that could lead to an \"uncivil war.\"\n\nMcKinnon concludes by questioning the actions of Senator Lindsey Graham and invoking the name of the late Senator John McCain, suggesting that McCain would have acted differently in this situation. The article ends with McKinnon expressing his hope that the Republican Party will do what is right for the nation.",
    " Title: Michelle Obama Stumps for Virginia Governor Candidate Terry McAuliffe, Raises Funds for US Senate Candidate Edward J. Markey\n\nArticle:\n\nMichelle Obama, the wife of President Barack Obama, is actively campaigning in key 2013 races, despite the ongoing political scandals surrounding the White House. On Thursday, she will raise funds for Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chief running for Virginia governor, at a hotel fundraiser in Fairfax County.\n\nJosh Schwerin, spokesman for the McAuliffe campaign, stated, \"Michelle Obama has been a leader on standing up for women, military families, and children. Terry McAuliffe is committed to continuing that work. She is one of the most popular figures in America, and we're really excited to have her here in Virginia.\"\n\nThe Virginia race is an off-season election, but it is critical as the state, captured twice by President Obama, is considered purple and is a target for Democrats aiming to convert it for the foreseeable future. The contest between McAuliffe and GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli is heating up, with both candidates trying to woo female voters and reach across the aisle to build a winning coalition to succeed Republican incumbent Bob McDonnell.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, commented, \"The first lady is traditionally a great draw for a big crowd, and she has little of the downside presented by her husband's controversies. People assume that the first lady is not involved in Oval Office skullduggery, and usually, this is the correct evaluation.\"\n\nLast week, Michelle Obama brought in an estimated $600,000 for Rep. Edward J. Markey (D), who is running for the US Senate in Massachusetts against Republican Gabriel Gomez. Obama has also appeared recently at the Democratic National Committee's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Leadership gala in New York City.\n\nAt these events, the first lady's message is that in backing these candidates or issues, voters are helping her husband's cause. Republicans, with a national leadership void, do not have an equally charismatic counterpart for her.\n\nAccording to Gallup, President Obama's approval rating has slipped below the 50 percent watermark, at 48 percent. By contrast, Gallup's most recent polling of the public's view of the first lady showed her with a 65 percent favorable rating.\n\nTracy Sefl, a Washington-based Democratic consultant, said the first lady \"speaks with a combination of accessible language and emotion\" and \"audiences find her magnetic.\" At campaign events, she does not have to delve into the weeds of congressional inquiries, and the questions or interruptions that have sometimes intruded on the president's public events do not occur when the first lady hits the trail.\n\n\"Her calendar is highly strategic,\" Sefl adds. \"Democrats recognize that her appearances on behalf of marquee candidates like Terry McAuliffe are all the more valuable during this lighter election cycle year. The spotlight she commands becomes even brighter. She's proven to be a Teflon first lady.\"\n\nHowever, some speculate that the recent appearances could indicate more than a savvy political use of the more popular Obama. In the waning months of her husband's tenure, Hillary Clinton turned her attention to a US Senate bid in New York, so could this be an early sign of how formidable a candidate Michelle Obama might be?\n\nOr has the Princeton and Harvard Law grad effectively tired of the Washington scene?\n\nProfessor Sabato, for his part, thinks the first lady \u2013 despite her proven campaign skills \u2013 will probably move onto other things. \"I'd be willing to bet Michelle Obama won't run for office,\" he says. \"While she's clearly enjoying the platform her current unofficial office brings, she would not have chosen politics as the family profession. Hillary Clinton is the exception that proves the rule about first ladies. Unlike Hillary, the rest have been quite happy to move back into semi-private life once the White House tour of duty is over.\"\n\nMichelle Obama will appear Thursday for McAuliffe at the Sheraton in Tysons Corner. Tickets range from $100 to $750; several hundred supporters are expected.",
    " Title: Trump Called to Release Secret Obama Administration Documents for Transparency\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is expected to face doubts about his legitimacy from the day he takes office, with opponents potentially portraying him as governing in unprecedented and reckless ways. In response, it is suggested that Trump should follow the precedent set by President Obama by releasing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration.\n\nIn 2009, shortly after taking office, President Obama released many of the secret Bush administration legal memos that explained the president's authority to order torture, deploy troops in American towns and cities, and ignore the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on warrantless, unreasonable searches. These disclosures signaled a new era in Washington and helped give Obama a reputation as a champion of civil liberties.\n\nIt is proposed that Trump should quickly reveal the secret memos underlying Obama's \"targeted killing\" drone assassination program, as well as the paper trail preceding and following the U.S. bombing of Libya in 2011. The release of these documents could help prevent similar foreign policy follies in the future and vindicate Trump's warnings on the campaign trail about U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War.\n\nThe Obama administration has been criticized for its handling of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, with federal agencies reportedly censoring government files or denying access to them. If Hillary Clinton had won the presidency, some people would have blamed the State Department's \"slow walking\" of FOIA requests for her emails, which she improperly kept on a private server.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also has a dreadful FOIA record, with political appointees stifling FOIA responses in a process that \"reeks of a Nixonian enemies list.\" Under Obama, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) became far more intrusive and abusive, launching \"enhanced patdowns\" that require screeners to touch passengers' breasts and genitals. The TSA conceals almost all information over its groping (which has caught zero terrorists) with a \"sensitive security information\" FOIA designation that justifies perpetual secrecy.\n\nExposing TSA coverups and reining in the agency would create a bounty of early goodwill for the Trump administration. House GOP should not get a pass on ethics, and Trump's promise to end and replace the Affordable Care Act would be greatly assisted by releasing the memos behind Obama's endless \"fixes\" to that law.\n\nRecent polls show that fewer than 20% of Americans now trust the federal government. Excessive secrecy spurs many Americans to presume that their rulers are up to no good. Regardless of the policies that Trump chooses, it would be a booster shot for democracy to reveal the back story of the Obama era.",
    " Title: Gender Pay Gap Remains Stagnant Despite Progress, Research Shows\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday marks Equal Pay Day, a day designated annually by the National Committee on Pay Equity to highlight the number of additional days women must work to earn what men did in the previous year. In 1963, when President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, a woman working full-time year-round typically earned 59 cents for every dollar paid to her male counterpart. By 2013, the latest year of available census data, this ratio had improved to 78 cents on the dollar.\n\nHowever, a closer examination reveals that progress in closing the gender pay gap has slowed over the past decade. The longer the gap persists, the less it can be attributed to factors other than discrimination.\n\nRecent research by the Economic Policy Institute shows that men still outearn women at every rung of the income ladder. The higher up the ladder, the larger the gap. In 2014, women in the 95th percentile of female earners made 79% of wages for men at the 95th percentile, while women in the lowest 10th percentile made 91 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts. At the high end, corporate norms are likely the biggest factor influencing pay scales, and while policies differ from company to company, the result is that women are still paid much less than men. At the low end, the minimum wage is a significant factor influencing pay scales, and since that applies to everyone, there is less pay disparity at the bottom of the ladder. Yet, even at that, women in low-wage jobs are paid less than men in low-wage jobs.\n\nThe gender pay gap is also pronounced among college-educated workers. The higher the level of education, the larger the gap. Men and women who have attended but did not graduate from college have the narrowest gap, with women making about 80% of what men made (or about $16 an hour on average for women versus $20 for men). Among those who have graduated from college, women's pay is about 78% of men's pay (or about $26 an hour on average for women; $33 for men), and among those with advanced degrees, women make about 74% of what men make (or about $33 an hour on average for women; $44 for men).",
    " Title: EPA's Tier 3 Gasoline Regulations: Costs Outweigh Benefits, Critics Argue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated 1,920 regulations since President Obama's 2009 inauguration, with many of these regulations imposing high economic and unemployment costs while providing few health or environmental benefits, according to The Heritage Foundation. The latest regulation, known as the Tier 3 rules, aims to further improve air quality by reducing sulfur in gasoline. However, critics argue that the benefits of these regulations are minimal, while the costs are significant.\n\nSince 1970, cars in the United States have reduced 99% of pollutants that once came from tailpipes, according to air pollution expert Joel Schwartz, co-author of \"Air Quality in America.\" Recent models start out cleaner and stay cleaner throughout their lives, reducing on-road emissions by an average of 8-10% per year. This has led to improved air quality, a trend that continues.\n\nFrom 2004 under Tier 1 and 2 rules, refiners have reduced sulfur in gasoline from an average of 300 parts per million to 30 parts per million, a 90% drop. By 2022, existing emission-reduction requirements will further reduce volatile organic pollutants by 62%, carbon monoxide by 51%, and nitrous oxides by 80%, on top of reductions achieved between 1970 and 2004.\n\nDespite these reductions, the EPA is now proposing to further lower sulfur levels to 10 parts per million. However, the agency's own computer models demonstrate that the Tier 3 rules would yield essentially no air quality or health benefits when earlier and ongoing reductions are factored in. In fact, Tier 3 improvements would reduce monthly ozone levels by barely 0.5 parts per billion on average to 1.2 parts per billion at peak levels, according to estimates by Environ International Corp. Using EPA models, these reductions would be equivalent to saving 5 to 12 cents out of $100 million.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute and other industry experts estimate that the Tier 3 rules would cost $10 billion in upfront capital expenditures and an additional $2.4 billion in annual compliance expenses. They would raise the price of gasoline by 6 to 9 cents per gallon, on top of new state fuel-tax hikes and gasoline prices that have increased from $1.79 to $3.51 per gallon of regular unleaded under President Obama.\n\nThese costs ripple throughout the economy, affecting job creation and retention, the price of goods and services, commuting costs, and the price tag on family vacations. They kill jobs and harm poor families most of all.\n\nMoreover, these Tier 3 rules are part of a larger regulatory regime that imposes costs to address risks and achieve benefits that exist only in EPA and environmental-activist computer models, press releases, and fear campaigns. They are an integral part of the administration's war on coal and other fossil fuels.\n\nAnother serious problem is that the EPA always assumes there is no safe threshold level for pollutants and that they must constantly be ratcheted downward, eventually to zero. This flies in the face of what any competent epidemiologist knows: The dose makes the poison. There is a point below which a chemical is not harmful. There are even chemicals that at low or trace quantities are essential to proper operation of our muscular, brain, and other bodily functions but at higher doses, can be poisonous. There are also low-level chemical, radiation, and pathogen exposures that actually safeguard our bodies from cancer, illness, and other damage, in a process known as hormesis.\n\nCritics argue that the EPA's actions are forcing us to expend vast financial, human, and technological resources to achieve minimal or even zero quantifiable health benefits. They call for science-based standards and common-sense regulations. Scrapping the unnecessary Tier 3 rules is a good place to start, according to critics. Citizens and lawmakers need to make certain the EPA and the president get the message.",
    " Title: Western Women Joining ISIS: A Closer Look at Female Jihadists\n\nArticle:\n\nAn estimated 30 Muslim women from the West, primarily British, are believed to have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, sparking shock among the wider public. This development, however, is not a new phenomenon, as Muslim women have long been influential in Islamic jihad.\n\nIn her book \"Wanted Women,\" Deborah Scroggins details the case of Afia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist from Pakistan who was found guilty in New York City of attempted murder of U.S. personnel investigating her material support to Al Qaeda. Siddiqui, now serving an 86-year sentence in federal prison, is a chilling example of a female Islamist who became a violent jihadist.\n\nExperts at Kings College International Center for Radicalization in Britain have been monitoring the online activities of 21 women among the 500 Britons thought to be in Syria with ISIS. These women's social media activity reveals they often attract other women to ISIS and support ISIS' recognition that in order to perpetuate itself, it must procreate.\n\nWomen are drawn to ISIS for various reasons. Some respond to ISIS' leader, Baghdadi, who has called upon them to help build the new Islamic State and assume traditional roles of marriage and childbearing. Others are skilled workers, such as doctors, nurses, and engineers, who are sought after by ISIS. Some women, however, seek combat and are joining to wage war.\n\nIn the United States, the recent case of 19-year-old Sharon Conley of Colorado is a chilling example of an American female newly converted to Islam and seeking jihad, imagining she will engage in combat, work as a nurse, and marry a fighter. Even under FBI interrogation, she remained committed to waging jihad.\n\nFemale Islamists, even violent jihadists, have long been prominent. In 2010, Afia Siddiqui was found guilty in New York City of attempted murder of U.S. personnel investigating her material support to Al Qaeda. Siddiqui's descent into radicalization and her equally disturbing rise to national adulation in Pakistan, where she remains lionized as a \"Daughter of the Nation,\" was detailed by Deborah Scroggins in her book.\n\nISIS, recognizing Siddiqui's stature, even offered to give up its captives in return for her release in an attempt to broaden its global outreach. In our correspondence, Scroggins reminded that her scholarship of Siddiqui underlined how \"women have always been swept up by the romance of jihad just like men.\"\n\nAt their most extreme, female jihadists become suicide bombers. Developed by the female Tamil Tigers, suicide bombing was imported by Hezbollah and became the hallmark of the Second Intifada against Israel. Radical clerics issued fatwahs legitimizing women as suicide bombers.\n\nDr. Anat Berko, a counterterrorism expert with the Israeli Defense Force, named them \"The Smarter Bomb,\" based on her 14-year studies of captured female Palestinian jihadists. Berko found their motives were as numerous as their identities. Some, sexually compromised in ways that they thought sullied their honor, believed martyrdom would absolve them of sin. Others were militant operatives, as politically motivated as their male counterparts.\n\nRegardless of what attracts them, women jihadists serve a fleeting purpose for ISIS. They are unaware that they will progressively lose their freedoms as they empower Islamism through their actions. Western women are joining ISIS nonetheless, so Americans must recognize the deadly ideology that attracts them for what it is: lethally totalitarian, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, supremacist, and profoundly anti-democratic. Political Islamism, whether espoused by men or women, is the gravest threat to secular democracy man has known. By unveiling these invisible women for the radical Jihadists they truly are, we can begin to confront Islamist ideology for what it is: a singularly lethal assault upon our sacred ideals.",

The meeting was scheduled to discuss the recent raids on immigrant communities.\n\nOn Thursday, Guti\u00e9rrez and Torres said Republicans asked them to leave the meeting with Homan. Guti\u00e9rrez stated, \"In 20-plus years, I have never heard of the Republicans controlling what meetings Democrats can have with officials of the executive branch and never had a staffer ask me to leave a meeting to which I am entitled to attend.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said during a press conference that ICE determined the guest list for the meeting. Initially, the list excluded all members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, but the Democrats were able to convince them to invite the caucus chairwoman, Michelle Lujan Grisham.\n\nCaucus members said the decision to exclude them was striking as they had initiated the meeting with Homan to discuss the raids happening in cities across the country. Agents have arrested more than 680 undocumented immigrants in what President Donald Trump touted on Twitter as a \"crackdown on illegal criminals.\"\n\nThe meeting was canceled at the last minute, with ICE stating that Homan's decision not to meet with the Hispanic Caucus was because they had invited too many people, and holding a meeting of that size without making it bipartisan would have broken congressional rules.\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Representative Grace Napolitano of California called the explanation \"bullshit\" and said administration officials routinely met with nonpartisan groups of lawmakers. A bipartisan meeting with the acting director was arranged for Thursday, but members of the Hispanic Caucus were not invited.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez and Torres attempted to enter the meeting while other members of the caucus waited outside. Guti\u00e9rrez was asked to leave first, followed by Torres. After leaving the meeting, the Democrats waited outside with other members of the caucus and held a prayer vigil for the families affected by the immigrant raids.\n\nAshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said his office had organized the briefing and \"at the request of DHS, limited to members with jurisdictional interests in immigration enforcement.\" Strong added, \"Members of the CHC expressed interest in attending, and to accommodate the request, we welcomed the chair of the CHC to join on behalf of the other members. We are confident that the CHC chair is capable of representing the views of her caucus, and this arrangement was made very clear to the CHC ahead of time.\"\n\nImmigrant rights groups brace for more deportation raids, with Pelosi stating, \"I've never seen anything like it and hopefully never [will] again.\" Meanwhile, Senator Kamala Harris of California took to the floor of the Senate to denounce the president's actions on immigration. Harris stated, \"I rise because the president's actions have created deep uncertainty and pain for our refugee and immigrant communities.\"\n\nAcross the country on Thursday, immigrants\u2014naturalized citizens, legal residents, and undocumented\u2014refused to go to work in protest against Trump's immigration actions. The boycott, known as a \"day without immigrants,\" was intended to highlight immigrants' contributions to the American workforce.\n\nRaids and mass detentions were tools that President Barack Obama frequently used from 2009 to 2017, and he deported at least 2.4 million people, more than any previous president. However, the first operations of Trump's presidency fanned fears around the country that his promised plan to deport millions of undocumented people had begun. ICE has stated that the raids were \"routine\" and no different than the arrests, detentions, and deportations carried out under the Obama administration, which targeted undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds or repeated immigration violations.",

In the tweets, Trump referred to Khan as a \"stone cold loser\" and accused him of being \"nasty\" to the U.S. President.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the Observer, Khan had previously described Trump as \"one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat.\" Khan blamed Trump for stoking the rise of the \"far right\" around the world. Trump is seen as a figurehead of this global far-right movement.\n\nKhan's comments came in response to Trump's criticism of him in a tweet earlier this month, in which Trump called Khan a \"very nasty guy\" who had done a \"terrible job\" as mayor of London.\n\nIn another diplomatic kerfuffle, Trump on Sunday denied calling Meghan Markle, now a member of the royal family, \"nasty.\" In an audio recording of his comment to The Sun newspaper, Trump did use the word \"nasty,\" but he also was complimentary about Meghan. The reporter asked Trump if he would be sorry not to see Markle, who is on maternity leave. Trump responded that he did not know that Markle had been critical of him during the campaign.\n\nThe reporter then asked Trump about having an American become a member of the British royal family. Trump responded, \"I think it's nice. I'm sure she'll do excellently.\" Trump also expressed hope that Meghan would do well as a member of the royal family.\n\nThe exchange between Trump and Khan is the latest in a series of public spats between the U.S. President and foreign leaders. The state visit is expected to focus on trade and security issues, as well as the special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K.",
    " Title: Hawaii Legislature to Consider Marriage Equality Act in Special Session\n\nThe Hawaii Legislature is set to begin a special session on Monday to consider the Marriage Equality Act, which would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. The governor called for the session to allow lawmakers to deliberate on the bill.\n\nThe debate over same-sex marriage in Hawaii dates back to 1990, when gay couples applying for a marriage license in the state sparked the national debate that led to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a federal law that was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.\n\nProponents of the bill, including Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie, are advocating for legislation that would make Hawaii the 15th state to legalize gay marriage. They argue that the bill aligns with the state's Aloha spirit of equality and could boost tourism.\n\nOpponents of the bill have organized protests, contending that Hawaiian voters, not the state's lawmakers, should decide the issue. In 1993, the state's supreme court ruled in favor of same-sex unions, but a constitutional amendment adopted five years later transferred jurisdiction from the courts to the Legislature, which then banned same-sex marriages.\n\nRallies in support of and against the bill have taken place in Honolulu over the weekend, with more rallies scheduled for Monday. The Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii has announced its support for the bill, marking the largest denomination to endorse the issue, which has divided people of faith.\n\nIf the measure is approved, it would take effect on November 18. A public hearing on the matter will be part of the special session on Monday, according to the Hawaii Legislature's website.\n\nIn addition to the 14 states where same-sex marriage is already legal and the District of Columbia, 35 states have enacted laws restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples, as a recent map by The Washington Post shows.",
    " Title: 2020 Candidate Kamala Harris Suggests Potential Prosecution of President Trump Post-Office\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a 2020 presidential candidate, has stated that if she were to win the White House, her Department of Justice would likely charge President Donald Trump with obstruction of justice. In a recent interview with NPR Politics Podcast, Harris expressed her belief that former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump due to the Justice Department's policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges, according to Harris.\n\nHarris emphasized the importance of accountability for all individuals, including the president. \"I believe that they would have no choice and that they should [pursue charges],\" Harris said, referring to the Department of Justice.\n\nThis suggestion from Harris follows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) reported comments last week, stating, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\"\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) have also hinted at the possibility of criminal charges against Trump, while Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has stated that no one is above the law without explicitly advocating for charges against the president.\n\nPresident Trump has reacted to these comments by calling Pelosi a \"nasty, vindictive, horrible person.\" Representative David Cicilline (D-R.I.) defended Pelosi's remarks, comparing them to then-candidate Trump's \"lock her up\" chants directed at Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. A 2018 New York Times report also mentioned that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey.",
    " Title: NRCC Launches Fake News Websites to Disguise Political Messaging\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has reportedly created a series of fake news websites to disseminate Republican messaging, disguised as local news. The websites, such as \"Des Moines Update\" and \"Aurora Update,\" are tailored to the districts of Democratic candidates and promote partisan messaging under the guise of news articles.\n\nThe sites, which have been active since 2014, are designed to appear as authentic local news websites, with sections for popular and most-viewed articles and videos. However, these sections are populated with content culled from NRCC opposition research. The source of the content is not immediately apparent, with the NRCC disclaimer appearing only at the bottom of the page, well below other links and separated by a significant amount of white space.\n\nOne example of the content on these sites is an article from the \"Tuscon Update\" targeting Arizona Democrat Ron Barber. The article, titled \"Arizona Democrat Ron Barber faces questions about pay equality,\" excerpts an article from the Arizona Daily Star reporting on the NRCC's attacks on Barber regarding his office's pay gap between men and women. The article, however, is actually a piece of NRCC-funded content, as it relies on statistics and calculations provided by the NRCC.\n\nThis practice, known as talking-point laundering, represents a streamlined approach to disguising GOP messaging as news. In the past, the NRCC would have had to rely on the lax ethics standards of certain cable news outlets to transform their handiwork into \"journalism.\" The NRCC is reported to have created around two dozen of these sites, targeting both Democratic challengers and incumbents across the country.",

In a surprise interview at the Wired 25 conference on Monday, Bezos stated that the internet, in its current form, is a confirmation bias machine.\n\nWhen asked about his perspective on the current state of technology, Bezos responded to Wired editor-at-large Steven Levy's question, \"how you\u2019re viewing this difficult moment for technology.\" A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that social media algorithms rely on confirmation biases to surface the most relevant content for users.\n\nAlessandro Bessi, a postdoctoral researcher with the Information Science Institute at the University of Southern California who co-authored the paper, told CNN, \"Our analysis showed that two well-shaped, highly segregated, and mostly non-interacting communities exist around scientific and conspiracy-like topics. Users show a tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs.\"\n\nLast week, Facebook announced it had removed 800 pages and accounts that were stirring up political engagement ahead of November's midterm elections by publishing misleading or fake stories that preyed on people's ingrained biases. Google's search has consistently been accused of political bias, but Google's explainer on how Google News chooses items states that most headlines a user sees are selected via Google's algorithms based on past usage history on Google Search, YouTube, the News app itself, and other properties. Conspiracy theory rabbit holes on YouTube show how users can create confirmation bias feedback loops for themselves.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been criticized for allowing tribalistic abuse to run rampant on the platform, and recently announced a plan to start addressing the problem. Bezos, however, remains optimistic about technology despite its shortcomings. He argued that it's better to disrupt than not innovate at all.\n\nBezos also acknowledged that biotech, while having dual uses, will save lives and cure diseases, but will also have dual uses. While Bezos was quick to point the finger at social media giants, he also welcomed scrutiny and criticism.",
    " Title: Misleading Crowd Photos: A Look at the Camera Trick Used in News Photography\n\nArticle:\n\nAs businesses reopen and people venture out to parks and beaches, photographs of seemingly crowded areas may appear in the news or on social media, leading to concerns about social distancing guidelines being ignored. However, these images can be misleading due to a common camera technique used by photographers.\n\nPhotographers often use a zoom or telephoto lens when shooting crowds, which compresses the foreground and background of a picture, making everyone appear closer together. An article on crowd photos in Outdoor Photography Guide explains that a 300mm lens \"compresses the crowd and makes it look larger yet more compact, creating more vibrant, more amplified photos.\"\n\nThis technique can make a \"crowd\" appear denser than it actually is, as demonstrated in a comparison of two photographs of the same beach on the same day, taken by the same photographer. In the original shot, people may appear to be standing very close to each other, but an aerial view shows that they are actually quite far apart.\n\nThis camera trick can be used deliberately to mislead, but it is also a convenient way to show many people in a crowd without having them appear at different sizes or with a lot of space between them. It's important to note that a photographer who uses this technique is not necessarily trying to deceive; there may be another reason why they photographed the scene the way they did.\n\nFor example, one newspaper editor pointed out that the photographer of a much-shared beach reopening shot \"shot the photo... with a long lens because she wanted to get as much of the beach as she could to accurately depict the scene.\"\n\nLandscape architect Jeff Cutler also demonstrated how different camera lens lengths can change the appearance of a crowd by photographing a local beach with several different lenses. This technique can also be used in video, as shown in a tweet that features a boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland, which appears to be \"packed\" with people. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the camera lens exaggerates the density of the crowd.\n\nThese misleading crowd shots can create unnecessary anxiety and tension, as people may be trying to avoid crowds and these shots may make it appear as though social distancing rules are being ignored. If infections do not rise with reopening, some may use these photos to claim that everything was crowded and that social distancing was not necessary. It's important to remain vigilant and maintain proper social distancing, but it's also important to be aware of the camera tricks that can make a situation appear more dire than it is.",
    " Title: Six Key Points to Watch in the CNBC Republican Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican presidential debate is set to take a more combative turn as candidates prepare for the CNBC debate on Wednesday. The GOP field has seen a shake-up in recent weeks, with Donald Trump no longer maintaining his invincible front-runner status due to the rise of Ben Carson. Jeb Bush has faced struggles, but promises a more assertive approach. Carly Fiorina has failed to convert strong debate performances into winning poll numbers, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has left the race.\n\nHere are six key points to watch in the CNBC debate:\n\n1. Donald Trump vs. Ben Carson: Trump, who has primarily targeted more seasoned politicians like Bush, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul, is expected to take on Carson following the latter's rise in the polls. Trump's recent attacks on Carson's religious affiliation have fueled speculation that Carson could be on Trump's vice presidential shortlist. Carson, known for his reserved demeanor, has stated he has no interest in becoming an attack dog.\n\n2. Jeb Bush's comeback: Bush will be two spots removed from Trump for the first time, signaling his recent struggles. The former Florida governor's national poll numbers have remained in the single digits behind political novices like Trump and Carson. Bush's advisers suggest he may show a more fiery and loose side during the debate.\n\n3. Carly Fiorina's momentum: Fiorina, who had a breakout performance in the last debate, is expected to discuss her focus on winning over voters at a steady pace, rather than relying on a series of breakout moments.\n\n4. The debt limit issue: Raising the debt ceiling has become a divisive topic among Republicans. This week, congressional leaders and the White House reached a two-year budget deal that would raise the debt ceiling. Candidates' stances on the debt limit could potentially divide the candidates on the stage.\n\n5. Lower-tier candidates' performances: Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Rand Paul rank at the bottom of the polls and face pressure to boost their rankings and persuade donors to continue funding their campaigns.\n\n6. Audience engagement: With the Iowa caucuses three months away, candidates will need to persuade viewers not to change the channel, as the debate coincides with Game 2 of the World Series. The first two GOP debates were record-setting blockbusters, but it may be challenging to maintain such high viewership numbers as the novelty of the debates wears off.",
    " Title: Former Governor Mark Sanford Seeks Old Congressional Seat in South Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, who was disgraced by an extramarital affair in 2009, is seeking to return to Congress. The vacancy in the state's 1st Congressional District was triggered by the resignation of Republican Rep. Tim Scott, who was appointed to replace outgoing Sen. Jim DeMint in December.\n\nSanford is one of 16 Republican candidates vying for the open seat. He previously held the position before running for governor. With a bitter divorce from his wife, Jenny, now behind him, Sanford is seeking a second chance from the public.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Sanford expressed, \"At some level or another we all hope for redemption.\" Sanford's colorful past, which includes an infamous affair that led to his public admission of being on the Appalachian Trail while he was actually traveling to Argentina, is not the only distraction in the race.\n\nOne of Sanford's GOP rivals, Teddy Turner, is the son of CNN founder Ted Turner. Turner's family ties, deep pockets, and sudden rise in some internal polling have made him a significant target. Opponents are filling mailboxes with attack ads on Turner, with some tying the candidate to one of his father's ex-wives, Jane Fonda.\n\nIf the Republican primary winner manages to navigate the race, they will likely face Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of Stephen Colbert, the host of Comedy Central's \"Colbert Report.\" Colbert Busch insists her candidacy is no joke, stating, \"This is not a joke. I don't think anybody would think that this was a joke. This is all too important.\"\n\nOther notable candidates in the race include State Sen. Larry Grooms, who has collected important local endorsements and boasts a staff that includes Hogan Gidley, a former spokesman for Rick Santorum, a former senator and Republican presidential candidate in 2012.\n\nWith such a short election schedule and a crowded field of candidates, the race could turn on name recognition, potentially favoring Sanford. John Avlon, a CNN political contributor whose family has lived in South Carolina for decades, noted that Sanford's honesty about his imperfect personal life has made him more relatable to voters.\n\nDespite his transgressions, the former governor maintains he is worthy of the public trust. Sanford asserts he has learned some important life lessons after wandering off-trail. \"Oddly enough, I think you learn from the valleys of life rather than the peaks,\" Sanford said.",
    " Title: Speculation Mounts Over Steve Bannon's Future in Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nRumors are circulating that Steve Bannon, a key advisor to President Donald Trump, may be on his way out of the White House. After two months of policy blunders that have tarnished Trump's image, speculation is rife that Bannon, the former Breitbart chief and campaign strategist, is losing favor with the President.\n\nIn a recent interview, Trump was asked about his feelings towards Bannon. The response, a reflection of Trump's familiar pattern, suggested that Bannon played a minor role in his campaign and that Trump's success was largely self-achieved.\n\n\"I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,\" Trump said. \"I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn\u2019t know Steve. I\u2019m my own strategist and it wasn\u2019t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.\"\n\nThis statement, reminiscent of Trump's previous declarations about other top campaign aides, has historical significance. According to Bill Palmer, the last two times the Trump team distanced itself from top campaign lieutenants who were implicated in the ongoing investigation of Russian espionage ties to Trump's presidential bid, the move was intended to distance the White House from Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.\n\nWhether Trump's statement implies that Bannon, too, is about to be implicated in Russian ties is unclear. However, \"he was not involved in my campaign until very late\" as a response to \"do you have confidence in Steve Bannon?\" is, at the least, a clear sign that Trump is contemplating distancing himself from Bannon.",
    " Title: Fact-Check: Bernie Sanders' Proposed Tax Rate on Incomes Above $29,000\n\nArticle:\n\nMultiple social media posts claim that 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is proposing a 52% tax rate on incomes above $29,000 a year. Examples of these claims can be found on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit.\n\nDuring the ninth Democratic debate on February 19, 2020, in Las Vegas, Nevada, former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg questioned Sanders' alleged plan to raise taxes for incomes above $29,000 to fund his health care plan. However, the debate transcript and video show no instances of anyone saying \"52%\" in relation to Sanders' proposed tax increase.\n\nIn the debate, Buttigieg expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in funding Sanders' health care plan, stating that even after raising taxes on incomes above $29,000, there would still be a multi-trillion-dollar funding gap. Sanders responded by stating that premiums would be eliminated, and individuals would save money due to the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments, and deductibles.\n\nThe 52% figure in the claim likely originates from a memo released by Sanders' Senate office ahead of the introduction of the Medicare for All Act of 2019. The memo discusses different tax proposals to finance Sanders' healthcare program, including a progressive income tax schedule with a 52% tax rate strictly applied to incomes over $10 million.\n\nHowever, the only evident proposal in the debate that could raise taxes on incomes above $29,000 is a 4% income-based premium applicable to all households making more than $29,000. This 4% premium is the only tax increase mentioned during the debate that could potentially affect incomes above $29,000.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Bernie Sanders plans to tax anyone making above $29,000 a year 52% is false. The 52% tax rate is only mentioned in relation to incomes over $10 million in Sanders' financing proposals for Medicare for All.",
    " Title: The GOP Establishment's Record of Choosing Candidates: A Review\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the perceived failure of the Republican Party (GOP) establishment in choosing successful candidates. It highlights several high-profile GOP candidates, including Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole, and both George Bush presidents, and argues that their presidencies were not successful. The article also mentions Ronald Reagan, who is considered the only undeniably successful Republican president of the modern era, but notes that he overcame the opposition of the GOP establishment.\n\nThe article further discusses the Senate, stating that today's Republican stars were once primary enemies of the GOP establishment, citing examples such as Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio. The article also mentions the Conservative Victory Project launched by Karl Rove, a former advisor to George W. Bush, which aims to protect entrenched Republicans against future challengers like Marco Rubio.\n\nThe article criticizes the GOP establishment's record of choosing candidates, citing examples such as former Florida Governor Charlie Crist, who abandoned the party after losing the primary to Marco Rubio. The article also compares the GOP establishment's record to that of Sarah Palin, who is credited with influencing the election of several successful Republican candidates, including Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio.\n\nThe article also discusses the upcoming 2014 elections, with 13 Republican senators facing re-election. The average tenure of these senators in Washington is over 18 years, and the article argues that they have failed to address the economic and moral deficit of increasing federal spending and national debt. The article mentions Senators Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Pat Roberts of Kansas, who have been in office for 40 and 32 years, respectively.\n\nThe article concludes by discussing a new, independent group called The Real Conservatives National Committee, which aims to take on the GOP establishment and elect real conservative leaders. The article cites the success of grass-roots challengers in primary races against the GOP establishment candidates and argues that the party needs more candidates like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio. The article ends with a call to action, urging readers to take a page out of Sarah Palin's playbook and take on the establishment.",
    " Title: NRA Files Lawsuit Against Florida Over New Gun Law\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida on Friday, hours after Governor Rick Scott signed legislation imposing new restrictions on guns in response to the February 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Florida, alleges that the new Florida law violates the Second and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms, and the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law. The NRA's lawsuit argues that the bill, which raises the age to buy firearms to 21, infringes on the Second Amendment rights of young adults. The NRA contends that the bill is particularly offensive to women under the age of 21, who are \"much less likely to engage in violent crime than older members of the general population who are unaffected by the ban.\"\n\nThe Florida bill includes new gun control measures, such as a three-day waiting period on most firearms, a ban on bump stocks, and a provision that allows police to petition in court for a risk protection order, which would let authorities restrict gun and ammunition possession for those considered a danger to themselves or others. The bill does not include an assault weapons ban.\n\nThe NRA's lawsuit names Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Rick Swearingen, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as defendants. Bondi, a Republican, said in a statement that she is proud of the law. \"This bill is not perfect, and sadly it will not bring back the 14 lives lost in the horrific school shooting, but the safety of our children is not a political issue \u2014 it's simply the right thing to do,\" she said.\n\nCameron Kasky, one of the survivors of the Parkland shooting, said in a tweet that the Florida bill was only the first step. The bill also includes a controversial provision to allow certain school employees to carry guns as part of new school security measures. School districts can participate in \"school guardianship\" programs that train and arm school employees.",
    " Title: U.S. Officials Grapple with Threat Posed by American Fighters in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. officials are grappling with the issue of American citizens joining the conflict in Syria, with at least 140 individuals reported to have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq so far. The number of U.S. passport holders involved in the fighting has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, according to U.S. intelligence officials.\n\nOne such individual is Eric Harroun, a former Army private who spent about six weeks fighting with rebel groups in Syria. Harroun's case highlights the complexity and potential dangers of American citizens joining the conflict in Syria.\n\nHarroun initially joined the Free Syrian Army, a group that the Obama administration is considering supporting with more arms and training. However, he later joined an avowedly anti-American Islamist fighting force called the Al-Aqsa Islamic Brigades. This led to his arrest on terrorism charges upon his return to the U.S.\n\nHarroun's case is not unique. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted that Harroun's story is an example of an American with concern for the Middle East who gets caught up in a situation beyond their comprehension. Neil MacBride, the U.S. attorney who led the Harroun prosecution, stated that there has yet to be a happy ending from a U.S. citizen going abroad and fighting on the ground in Syria.\n\nThe problem in Syria is the chaotic nature of the fighting, making it difficult to distinguish one group from another. In Harroun's case, his lack of Arabic language skills compounded the issue.\n\nU.S. law enforcement's approach now appears to be to assume the worst, with the FBI starting to arrest people before they leave for Syria. This is due to the complex and challenging nature of the Syrian battlefield, where groups overlap and allegiances shift.\n\nEventually, U.S. officials decided Harroun was not such a threat. After six months in solitary confinement in Alexandria, Va., he was released with time served and charged with illegally providing weapons to a foreign fighting force. However, Harroun's story ends tragically, as he died of an overdose of prescription pills in April. His family attributed his death to an accident.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Faces Three Challengers in 2020 Republican Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump, the incumbent U.S. president, has faced criticism from three Republican candidates vying for the party's nomination in the 2020 primary contest. The latest challenger, Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor, announced his candidacy during an interview with Fox News on Sunday.\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Trump referred to Mr. Sanford, two other hopefuls, and their campaigns as \"badly failed candidates.\" He also brought up Mr. Sanford's extramarital affair with an Argentine woman in 2009, describing her as his \"flaming dancer friend.\"\n\nMr. Sanford, aged 59, is expected to center his campaign on cutting government debt and spending. In his interview, he expressed concerns about the president's approach to debts and deficits, stating, \"The president has called himself the king of debt, has a familiarity and comfort level with debt that I think is ultimately leading us in the wrong direction.\"\n\nDonald Trump now has three official challengers for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination. This is noteworthy given the president's current popularity within the party. However, none of the candidates appears to pose a serious threat to the president at this time.\n\nIn April, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld became the first person to challenge Mr. Trump. He was followed by conservative radio host and former lawmaker Joe Walsh at the end of August. The Republican National Convention, at which the nominee will be formally chosen, will take place in late August 2020 after a series of state primary elections and party caucuses.\n\nSome state Republican parties, including in South Carolina, have decided not to hold primaries in 2020, clearing the path for Mr. Trump and saving money. This move is expected to benefit the incumbent president, as no sitting president in the modern era has lost the race to be their party's nominee.\n\nMr. Sanford criticized Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential election but ultimately supported him. However, he became one of the president's toughest Republican critics in Congress when Mr. Trump took office. That stance cost him the Republican primary when his seat was up for re-election last year. He was beaten by a pro-Trump challenger who went on to lose the election to her Democratic opponent.\n\nElection day is still more than a year away, but the race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump is already well underway.

    " Title: President Trump Signs Executive Order on Law Enforcement Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order titled \"Safe Policing for Safe Communities\" on Tuesday, aiming to address racial disparities in policing and the criminal justice system. The order, which follows the death of George Floyd, is intended to uphold clear and high policing standards, promote accountability in law enforcement, and equip police officers for constructive community engagement.\n\nThe executive order covers use of force best practices, information sharing to track officers with repeated complaints, and federal incentives for police departments to deploy non-police experts on issues like mental health, homelessness, and addiction.\n\nTrump's order also addresses efforts in Congress to pass legislation on criminal justice reform, which have reportedly faced obstacles. The president did not provide details of the order during a Monday roundtable, stating that it would have \"some solutions.\"\n\nThe White House emphasized that the order aims to help law enforcement build trust and effectively serve the community as the first line of defense. Trump has been sparring with local officials and dealing with backlash over his handling of the unrest following Floyd's death, trying to balance his desire to be a \"LAW & ORDER!\" president with his campaign's efforts to court black voters.\n\nIn a separate development, multiple Atlanta officers have resigned this month as morale is reportedly at an all-time low. The White House stated that the order would help law enforcement build trust and effectively serve the community.\n\nTrump has faced criticism over his handling of the protests and riots, particularly regarding an incident in which federal law enforcement cleared protesters from Lafayette Square. Critics have suggested that the clearing of the square was to allow Trump to visit a nearby church, while Trump allies, including Attorney General Bill Barr, have stated that the clearing of the square had been planned well in advance.\n\nCurrently, Trump is threatening to step in with federal forces to clear protesters from a six-block area of downtown Seattle, known as the \"Capitol Hill Organized Protest\" or CHOP, which has been declared \"cop-free\" by its occupants. Trump has urged local officials to take back control of the occupied part of their city, but neither Governor Jay Inslee nor Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan has expressed much desire to do so.",
    " Title: Uber Driver Accused in Michigan Shooting Rampage\n\nArticle:\n\nThe suspect in a shooting rampage that left six people dead and two others injured in Michigan on Saturday night is identified as Jason Dalton, a married father of two who was working as an Uber driver, according to USA Today. Dalton, 45, passed a background check when he was hired by Uber, the company told the paper.\n\nAuthorities are investigating a Facebook post that suggests Dalton picked up Uber customers around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said he was aware of the post but was not prepared to discuss it.\n\nDalton lived in a ranch-style house just outside Kalamazoo, where the shootings occurred, with his wife of at least 15 years and two children, ages 10 and 15, according to USA Today.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told WMMT-TV that Dalton was arrested without incident early Sunday morning in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt. Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl was wounded outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, and a father and son were killed outside a Kia dealership, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. A woman shot outside an apartment complex was in serious condition as of early Sunday, Matyas said. The 14-year-old girl was in critical condition.\n\nMatyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as \"our worst-case scenario.\"\n\nThe shooting spree began about 6 p.m. in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Richland Township on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County, where a woman was shot and seriously wounded. The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said. Matyas told WWMT-TV that the man did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and that weapons were found in his vehicle.\n\nMichigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz called the shooting spree \"incomprehensible,\" according to Fox 17 Online. Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city also is known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition for students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for more than a decade.",
    " Title: Saudi Arabia Maintains 2 Million Barrels Per Day Spare Capacity, White House Says\n\nArticle:\n\nThe leader of Saudi Arabia has affirmed that the Kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day (bpd) spare capacity, which it will use if and when necessary to ensure market balance, according to a statement from the White House. The announcement comes after President Donald Trump asked the Saudi Arabian King to increase oil production during a phone call on Friday.\n\nTrump had earlier tweeted that Saudi Arabia had agreed to produce more oil, potentially up to 2 million bpd, to offset a decline in supply from Iran following the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May and the imposition of oil sanctions. However, the White House statement on Saturday rowed back on Trump's tweet, stating that the Saudi leader was ready to raise output if needed but did not specify a specific increase.\n\nSaudi Arabia, along with other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC nations, including Russia, had agreed on June 22 to boost production by a combined 700,000 to 1 million bpd. Any 2 million bpd increase would be at least double market expectations.\n\nThe White House statement undercut Trump's earlier tweet, which suggested that the extra Saudi oil would help offset a decline in supply from Iran. Trump was not specific on whether the additional 2 million barrels was a per-day figure, but worldwide daily demand is nearing 100 million bpd.\n\nSaudi Arabia has a maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million bpd, but it has never tested that level of production. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Thursday to discuss energy security.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November when the United States re-imposes sanctions against Tehran. U.S. officials are pressing allies in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East to adhere to the sanctions, with the aim of pressuring Iran into negotiating a new agreement.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Washington of trying to turn Iranians against their government, while Iran's rial currency has lost up to 40% of its value since last month, when Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal. Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, accused the United States and Saudi Arabia of trying to push up oil prices and acting against the foundation of OPEC.",
    " Title: Justice Department Faces Challenges in Federal Investigation of George Zimmerman's Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department is encountering obstacles in its investigation of potential civil rights violations by George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, with the main hurdle being the lack of evidence indicating racial bias on Zimmerman's part before the 2012 shooting.\n\nIn the aftermath of Zimmerman's acquittal, the department announced its intention to consider a possible federal case. However, previously filed FBI documents reveal that agents have not uncovered any accounts suggesting Zimmerman exhibited racial bias prior to the shooting. Sanford police detective Chris Serino told FBI agents last year that he considered Zimmerman as having \"a little hero complex,\" but not as a racist.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder, in his first post-verdict comments, confirmed on Monday during a speech in Washington, D.C., that the department continues to investigate while expressing concern for the Martin family and those pressing the DOJ. He stated that the department is \"mindful of the pain felt by our nation\" over the \"tragic, unnecessary shooting death\" of Martin.\n\nHolder emphasized the opportunity to address the charged issues involved in the case and urged that \"we must not... let this opportunity pass.\" He even suggested the possibility of bias in this case, stating it's important to address \"underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents.\"\n\nThe attorney general, however, stated that the department would act \"in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.\" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney indicated that President Obama would keep his distance from the consideration, adding that the merits of the case will be \"evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice.\"\n\nFlorida defense attorney Brian Tannebaum told FoxNews.com that the \"number one challenge\" for DOJ is the evidence, or lack thereof. \"There's been an acquittal. The evidence has not changed. It's not like the feds are going to go in and find more evidence,\" he said. Tannebaum understands the Justice Department's response to public sentiment, but \"I don't foresee it becoming a federal case.\"\n\nThe question of racial bias is crucial because, if the Justice Department were to pursue a federal case against Zimmerman, federal hate-crimes law is one of the few tools the department would have. The statute bars \"willfully\" causing injury to someone else \"because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person.\"\n\nThe department has used federal civil rights law before to pursue defendants who had been acquitted at the state level. However, in what is perhaps the most famous such case\u2014the Rodney King beating\u2014the circumstances were different. First, there was a highly publicized video of the King beating. No such video of the Martin shooting is known to exist.\n\nSecond, the two officers ultimately convicted on federal charges in that case were charged with using or permitting unreasonable force under \"color of law\"\u2014this applies only to law enforcement. The separate federal hate-crimes law applies to both law enforcement and civilians. However, it's unclear how the Justice Department could prove racial bias.\n\nSerino, the Sanford detective, told FBI agents last year that after examining the case, it appeared Zimmerman was suspicious of Martin because of his \"attire, the total circumstances of the encounter, and the previous burglary suspects in the community.\" Serino told the FBI that there had been several burglaries in the area, and that gang members in the community \"typically dressed in black and wore hoodies.\"\n\n\"When Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody, Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious,\" Serino said, while describing Zimmerman as \"overzealous.\" The FBI document was posted on the Smoking Gun website.\n\nMcClatchy also has reported on another set of documents that show FBI agents interviewed dozens of people in the course of probing possible racial bias, but nobody would say Zimmerman showed such bias before the shooting.\n\nThe department may find itself in a vulnerable spot, not only because of prior interviews which found no evidence of bias, but also due to allegations of intervention in the case. Last week, a conservative watchdog accused an obscure agency within the DOJ of helping support the \"pressure campaign\" against Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting last year.\n\nJudicial Watch claimed documents and public accounts showed \"extraordinary intervention\" by the department in the campaign that eventually led to Zimmerman's prosecution. The department, however, claims that it dispatched agency representatives to reduce tensions in the community\u2014not to take sides.\n\nThe department is under heavy pressure from some groups to pursue the case further. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and other House Democrats called a press conference on Monday to urge the Justice Department to \"conduct an immediate and thorough investigation.\" The NAACP started the drive to pressure the DOJ to continue its probe by posting a petition Sunday morning on the website MoveOn.org.\n\n\"The most fundamental of civil rights\u2014the right to life\u2014was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,\" the group wrote. Attorney General Eric Holder plans to speak at the NAACP convention on Tuesday.",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Looming Deadlines as Obama Administration Warns of Early Debt Limit Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is facing a potential fiscal crisis as the Obama administration has warned House Republicans that a deal on increasing the federal debt limit may need to be reached earlier than expected. In a letter from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to House Speaker John Boehner, the administration expressed concern over two looming deadlines that have yet to be addressed.\n\nThe first deadline is the prevention of a partial government shutdown, which requires Congress and the Obama administration to agree on at least a temporary spending deal. While such a bill is typically reached without significant partisan wrangling, this year's effort is complicated by Republicans insisting any measure should include the steep cuts known as sequester that started in the spring, and by some Democrats demanding their removal. Additionally, a small group of Tea Party-backed Republicans is pushing for the defunding of the president's health care law, whose official signup date is Oct. 1, to be stripped from any budget bill.\n\nThe second deadline is the debt-ceiling deadline, which Lew stated in his letter on Monday will follow close behind. According to Lew, the Treasury Department will run out of \"extraordinary measures\" \u2013 tactics to avoid bumping up against the debt ceiling \u2013 in the middle of October, risking a default unless Congress raises the cap.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew told Boehner, R-Ohio, that extending borrowing authority does not increase government spending; it simply allows the Treasury to pay for expenditures Congress has previously approved. Lew emphasized that protecting the credit of the United States is the responsibility of Congress because only Congress can extend the nation's borrowing authority.\n\nBoehner's office responded, stating that the debt ceiling is a reminder that \"under President Obama, Washington has failed to deal seriously with America's debt and deficit.\"\n\nIn 2011, Boehner and Obama reached a complex deal, agreeing to roughly $900 billion in immediate spending cuts in exchange for an increase in borrowing authority by a similar amount. This deal set the groundwork for the sequester cuts now in place, as well as more increases in the debt ceiling. However, the high-wire act had a significant economic impact, roiling financial markets worldwide and contributing to Standard & Poor's downgrading the credit rating on U.S. bonds.\n\nThe current debt ceiling is $16.7 trillion. Economists had predicted for months that the federal government would no longer be able to pay its bills after Labor Day, but at least some thought the deadline was closer to November.\n\nIf the government cannot increase its borrowing authority, Lew stated that the Treasury would have to use the $50 billion in cash it currently holds, with no solid way of predicting when all of that money will be spent.\n\nThe White House and a group of Republican senators have reportedly been working on proposed fiscal deals to avoid last-minute negotiations, but these talks have allegedly stalled. Though Boehner indicated last week that he wants to pass a short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, he reportedly vowed on Monday to put up a \"whale of a fight\" over the debt limit.\n\n\"I've made it clear that we're not going to increase the debt limit without cuts and reforms that are greater than the increase in the debt limit,\" Boehner said at a fundraiser for Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson, according to the Idaho Statesman.\n\nMichigan Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, after Lew's letter, urged the GOP to increase the debt limit.\n\n\"With just nine legislative days currently scheduled in September, Republicans must return to Congress prepared to move beyond the kind of brinksmanship that undermined our economic recovery two years ago,\" Levin said. \"It is time for Republicans to do the right thing \u2013 not the far right thing.\"",
    " Title: Florida Hurricane Irma: Governor's Response and Media Coverage\n\nArticle:\n\nA massive storm, identified as Hurricane Irma, moved through Florida, displacing an estimated five million people. The storm affected the entire state, including a large population of retired Americans. Florida Governor Rick Scott issued numerous warnings and monitored the activities of the state's National Guard and first responders. He described the storm as a \"catastrophic\" event and urged citizens to pray for the state.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, the national media, often referred to as the Mainstream Media, faced criticism for its response. The Washington Post published an article titled \"Florida Governor Has Refused to Recognize Climate-Change Risks, Critics Say.\" The article focused on Governor Scott's perceived lack of acknowledgment of climate change risks, with no response from the Governor's office.\n\nThe debate about climate change and its role in hurricanes like Irma is ongoing. Some scientists argue that global warming contributes to such events, while others dispute this claim. It is important to note that the connection between hurricanes and global warming is not yet conclusively proven.\n\nGovernor Scott, like many others, has expressed concern about the potential human factor in global warming. He advocates for policies that allow for global growth, arguing that this would enable the world to address climate issues through technological development and innovation.\n\nThe article concludes by mentioning the persistence of political rhetoric, particularly from the left, which is described as \"poisonous.\" The author expresses doubt about the effectiveness of the proposed solutions to address global warming and questions the consensus among scientists regarding the issue.\n\nThe author also touches on the role of anger in politics, noting its prevalence among the left and the lack of a similar phenomenon on the right. The article ends with a reference to the Ku Klux Klan, suggesting a comparison between the intensity of political anger on the left and on the far right. This comparison may be seen as controversial or divisive, and it is important to note that the Ku Klux Klan stands for ideologies that are widely condemned as hateful and discriminatory.",
    " Title: Trump Sets Six-Month Deadline for Congress to Address DACA, Ending Obama-Era Program\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Tuesday that President Donald Trump has given Congress a six-month deadline to address America's immigration system, with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program set to end after that period. The DACA program, established in 2012, grants work permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to end DACA, which protects approximately 800,000 people from deportation, was based on the argument that it was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch. Only Congress has the power to create such programs, Sessions stated.\n\nIn a statement, President Trump said, \"As President, my highest duty is to defend the American people and the Constitution of the United States of America. At the same time, I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are a nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.\"\n\nBefore the announcement, Trump had hinted at his decision through a tweet on September 5, 2017, stating, \"Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA!\"\n\nThe administration hopes that six months will be sufficient time for Congress to come up with a legislative fix before the government stops renewing permits for people already covered by the program. President Trump said, \"The legislative branch, not the executive branch, writes these laws \u2013 this is the bedrock of our Constitutional system, which I took a solemn oath to preserve, protect, and defend.\"\n\nThe DACA program was created to protect young immigrants, often referred to as \"dreamers,\" who did not choose to violate U.S. immigration law as they were brought into the country by their parents or other family members.\n\nMany people have protested ending the program due to its economic impact. According to a survey from the Center for American Progress, 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed. A survey respondent stated, \"Because of DACA, I opened a restaurant. We are contributing to the economic growth of our local community. We pay our fair share of taxes and hire employees... It will be hard to maintain my business if DACA ended.\"\n\nSome members of President Trump's evangelical advisory board have asked him to protect the \"dreamers.\" The Washington Post reports that Atlanta pastor Jentzen Franklin and others pleaded with the president to preserve DACA last week in a meeting in the Oval Office. A White House official stated that delaying the enforcement by six months will give Congress time to act on a broader solution for immigration reform.",
    " Title: Trump Endorses Paul Ryan, Reunites with House Speaker After Public Spat\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has publicly endorsed House Speaker Paul Ryan, days after a public spat between the two top Republican figures. In a campaign stop in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Mr. Trump expressed his support for Mr. Ryan, stating, \"I support and endorse our Speaker... Paul Ryan.\"\n\nThe endorsement comes after Mr. Trump refused to endorse Mr. Ryan and Senator John McCain in their campaigns for re-election in November, shocking party members on Tuesday. Mr. Ryan, the party's highest-ranking elected official, had himself long delayed endorsing Mr. Trump.\n\nDuring the campaign stop, Mr. Trump emphasized the need for unity, stating, \"We need unity - we have to win this election.\" He added that while they might \"disagree on a couple of things,\" they agreed on a lot as well. Mr. Trump also endorsed Sen. McCain and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte.\n\nIn an earlier interview with the Washington Post, Mr. Trump had stated he was \"just not quite there yet\" when asked if he would endorse Mr. Ryan and Sen. McCain. The same phrase was used by Mr. Ryan before he finally endorsed the Republican presidential candidate.\n\nMr. Ryan and Sen. McCain had both criticized Mr. Trump's attacks on the bereaved parents of a U.S. Muslim soldier killed in Iraq. The soldier, Humayun Khan, was killed by a car bomb in 2004 at the age of 27.\n\nAnthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter, provides analysis on the Trump campaign, suggesting that the candidate's enthusiastic audiences and campaign coffers full of cash make a comeback story likely. The roller-coaster ride of the Republican establishment's relationship with Mr. Trump has seen periods of reluctant acceptance and sky-is-falling hysteria. However, the general election sprint is only just beginning, and there may still be periods of resigned accommodation ahead. If Mr. Trump can maintain a focused message and avoid controversial statements, the polls could narrow to a more typical partisan split.",
    " Title: Hollywood Stars Call for Unity at the 92nd Academy Awards, but Media Focuses on Political Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 92nd Academy Awards, held on February 9, 2020, witnessed a call for unity and camaraderie from two key award winners, Renee Zellweger and Joaquin Phoenix. However, their messages of inclusion, civility, and the importance of finding common ground were largely overshadowed by the political divide in media coverage.\n\nRenee Zellweger, who won the award for her lead role in \"Judy,\" emphasized the unifying power of shared heroes. She stated, \"When we look to our heroes, we agree, and that matters. Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, Dolores Huerta, Venus and Serena and Selena, Bob Dylan, Scorsese, Fred Rogers, Harriet Tubman... When we celebrate our heroes, we're reminded of who we are as one people united.\"\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, who won for his role in \"Joker,\" also emphasized the need for unity in the face of various societal issues. He said, \"I've been thinking a lot about some of the distressing issues that we are facing collectively. I think, whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we're talking about the fight against injustice.\"\n\nThe calls for unity and common ground made by Phoenix and Zellweger during one of the most glamorous events on the U.S. calendar received little media attention. While Phoenix's calls for equality were the subject of a CNN entertainment piece, both their speeches were satirically analyzed in an article from Vulture.\n\nAs political polarization continues to threaten the fabric of American democracy, reminders of commonalities are crucial. It is baffling that these calls for civility, made during a highly publicized event, received little media attention.\n\nIn a time when the media often seems eager to acknowledge extreme polarization, it is encouraging to see powerful voices championing the value of common ground. This positive message is one that all Americans can get behind.\n\nWe invite our readers to share their thoughts on this topic. Be a part of the solution to finding solutions. Tell us here.",
    " Title: Deaf Community Highlights Systemic Barriers and Awareness of Police Interactions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent performance of the national anthem at the Super Bowl by a deaf individual has sparked discussions about the experiences of deaf individuals, particularly in interactions with law enforcement. The performer, whose name is unavailable, highlighted several instances of mistreatment and fatal encounters between deaf individuals and police officers.\n\nRobert Kim, a deaf man, was beaten and tasered by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb in 2012. Daniel Kevin Harris was shot and killed by a North Carolina state trooper in 2016. In 2014, Pearl Pearson was badly beaten by police officers, and Magdiel Sanchez was shot and killed by police in front of his home in Oklahoma City in 2017.\n\nThese incidents are part of a pattern, as Amiel Fields-Meyer noted in a 2017 article for The Atlantic. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires the government to provide \"effective communication\" and \"reasonable accommodation,\" but gaps in cultural competency among law enforcement have led to strained and sometimes deadly interactions with the deaf community.\n\nThe performer, in their article, also highlighted other inequalities faced by the deaf community, such as limited access to mental health services, healthcare, sign language, inadequate online accessibility, lack of employment opportunities, and more. These inequalities disproportionately affect people of color.\n\nThe performer's appearance at the Super Bowl was intended to raise awareness of systemic barriers and stigmas attached to deafness, and to move people to action. Despite the failure of Fox to make the performance accessible to all, the performer hopes that it did achieve that goal.\n\nThe performer's parents took action by learning to sign for their deaf children, making them feel seen and respected. Today, the performer is teaching their hearing child to sign as well. Respecting all languages and identities, the performer believes, can only lead to better laws and a higher quality of life.\n\nThe National Association of the Deaf (N.A.D.) has posted video of the performer's entire performances of \"America the Beautiful\" and the national anthem on YouTube.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee Members Allege Obama Administration Broke Law in Bergdahl Prisoner Exchange\n\nArticle:\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Obama administration's decision to release five high-level Taliban members in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl without Congressional consent persists on Capitol Hill. As more details emerge about the deal, which many view as a bad decision, several lawmakers are questioning the legality of the swap.\n\nOne of these lawmakers is Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. On Tuesday, two top lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee stated that the Obama administration violated the law by not informing Congress before the prisoner exchange that led to Bergdahl's release.\n\nSenator Feinstein and Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss argued that the administration disregarded serious concerns they had about the deal to swap Bergdahl for five Taliban detainees. Chambliss stated he had not had a conversation with the White House about a possible exchange for at least 18 months.\n\n\"It comes to us with some surprise and dismay that the transfers went ahead with no consultation, totally not following the law,\" Feinstein told reporters following a closed-door meeting. \"And in an issue with this kind of concern to a committee that bears the oversight responsibility, I think you can see that we're very dismayed about it.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, who put the Blind Sheik in prison for his role in the first World Trade Center bombing, echoed these concerns on Fox News' The Kelly File. McCarthy, who has a new book out, has stated that this situation could be grounds for impeachment. Judge Andrew Napolitano agrees, stating that this argument is \"very, very valid.\"\n\nThe White House, who expected the Bergdahl decision to be met with \"euphoria,\" now faces a significant issue.",
    " Title: US Government Shutdown Reaches 22nd Day, Longest in U.S. History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing partial shutdown of the United States government has surpassed the previous record, marking the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 22 days. The standoff between political parties shows no signs of resolution.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is withholding approval of a budget unless it includes funding for a border wall with Mexico. Approximately a quarter of the federal government remains shut down until a spending plan is agreed, leaving 800,000 employees unpaid.\n\nOn Friday, these workers, including prison guards, airport staff, and FBI agents, missed their first salaries of the year. President Trump has recently dismissed speculation that he is planning to declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and secure the necessary funds for the border wall, a key election promise.\n\nIn response to a question about an emergency declaration, Trump stated, \"If they can't do it [resolve the problem], I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right.\" However, Democrats have indicated they would mount an immediate legal challenge if Trump were to make such a move.\n\nOn Friday, some workers who missed their first payday of the year shared their blank payslips on social media. Oscar Murillo, an aerospace engineer at NASA, posted his $0 check on Twitter and stated he had actually lost money due to mandatory deductions. Another Twitter user, Cat Heifner, shared what she said was her brother's payslip, showing he had been paid one cent for his work as an air traffic controller.\n\nA food bank in Washington, D.C., is arranging five pop-up markets on Saturday for unpaid federal workers. Radha Muthiah, head of Capital Area Food Bank, said dozens of volunteers were working to pack bags of food for affected staff.\n\nCraigslist has been inundated with listings from government employees trying to sell their possessions. Items ranging from beds to old toys have been listed as \"government shutdown specials.\" One advertisement for a child's rocking chair reads, \"Sells for $93.88 at Walmart. Asking $10.\" The seller notes, \"We need money to pay bills.\"\n\nOf the 800,000 federal employees going unpaid, about 350,000 are furloughed, a kind of temporary lay-off, while the rest are continuing to work. Thousands have reportedly applied for unemployment benefits amid the financial uncertainty.\n\nOne major airport, Miami International, will close an entire terminal this weekend due to a shortage of security agents caused by the shutdown. The agents are \"essential\" federal workers and are expected to work, despite not being paid until the shutdown ends. Instead, many agents are calling in sick in protest of the situation, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nThe House and Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill on Friday to ensure all government workers receive retroactive pay after the shutdown ends. The president is expected to sign the legislation. However, this may provide little consolation to those federal employees currently facing financial hardship with no end in sight to the impasse.\n\nAt a roundtable discussion about border security on Friday with state and local leaders, Mr. Trump again demanded that Democrats approve funding for a wall or steel barrier. However, the Democratic leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, stated, \"When the president acts, we will respond to whatever he does.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, senior White House aide Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, is among those who have cautioned the president against declaring a national emergency. US media report the White House is considering diverting some of the $13.9 billion allocated last year by Congress for disaster relief in areas such as Puerto Rico, Texas, and California to pay for the wall. However, Republican congressman Mark Meadows, who is close to the president, stated that this option was not under serious consideration.\n\nFor further information or to speak to a BBC journalist, please contact the following numbers or methods:\n- Phone: [BBC contact number]\n- Email: [BBC email address]\n- Twitter: [BBC Twitter handle]\n- Facebook: [BBC Facebook page]\n- Instagram: [BBC Instagram handle]\n- WhatsApp: [BBC WhatsApp number]\n- Postal mail: [BBC postal address]",

The perpetrators fled, leaving the terrified children to deal with the aftermath of the unspeakable cruelty. The Palestinian response was one of celebration, with Palestinian newspapers describing the act as a \"heroic\" one.\n\nIn response to the violence, the White House expressed \"deep concern\" and \"strongly condemned\" the violence against Israeli and Palestinian civilians. However, the statement also called for both parties to \"refrain from actions and rhetoric that would further escalate tensions,\" with an implied blame towards Israel. The U.S. government is \"monitoring\" the situation with a \"growing sense of alarm.\"\n\nIsraeli President Benjamin Netanyahu faced a difficult time getting a fair hearing for Israel at the U.N. During his address, he pointed out that Iran, guaranteed by Obama's deal to obtain a nuclear bomb, continues to threaten the Jewish state. The General Assembly audience remained silent during Netanyahu's speech, with no applause or even a rumble of applause.\n\nThe same audience had cheered Obama the day before for his deal with the Iranian government. The silence of the American delegates during Netanyahu's speech was particularly notable, with no response to his statements about Iran's continued spread of fear and terror, and its opposition to American and democratic interests.\n\nPresident Obama's handling of the Middle East has been criticized, with some accusing him of not liking Jews or Israelis. However, the White House dismisses such accusations as canard. The ongoing violence in the region has raised concerns about the effectiveness of Obama's leadership in the Middle East, with some questioning his understanding of the situation.",
    " Title: Veteran Lawyer Emmet Jopling Bondurant II to Argue Redistricting Case Before Supreme Court 55 Years After Initial Voting Rights Case\n\nArticle:\n\nEmmet Jopling Bondurant II, a veteran lawyer who was part of a landmark voting rights case in the 1960s, is set to argue before the Supreme Court once again, 55 years later. The case, which concerns partisan redistricting, or gerrymandering, will see Bondurant representing the side that seeks to block the practice.\n\nBondurant, now 82, was a student at the University of Georgia during the 1950s, but he did not actively participate in the civil rights movement. However, his legal career took a significant turn in the 1960s when he became involved in the Wesberry v. Sanders case, a case that aimed to ensure equal populations in congressional districts.\n\nHistorian Doug Smith, author of On Democracy's Doorstep: The Inside Story Of How The Supreme Court Brought \"One Person, One Vote\" To The United States, noted that urban populations had grown significantly leading up to the 1960s, but politicians were not adjusting the districts. In Michigan, for example, about 800,000 people lived in the largest district, which included Detroit, while just over 117,000 people lived in the smallest district.\n\nBondurant compared the practice at that time to partisan redistricting today. \"They did not want the districts changed,\" he said. \"They did not want new competition. They did not want new voters. They wanted the old voters they already had. And that is one form of gerrymandering.\"\n\nIn the upcoming case before the Supreme Court, Bondurant is set to argue for the side asking the court to block the practice. He spent his nights and weekends working on the Wesberry v. Sanders case for free, a time-consuming effort due to the data involved, as it was before even hand-held calculators.\n\nBondurant argued before the Supreme Court for the first time on November 18, 1963, at the age of 26. He has since won numerous big corporate cases, but he is perhaps best known for his work in civil rights cases. In the 1990s, he helped secure the exoneration of Gary Nelson, who spent about a decade on death row. In the 1980s, he risked his reputation arguing for an Atlanta woman in a gender bias case.\n\nBonduratn has also backed small civil rights groups like the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center in Atlanta, founded by Helen Kim Ho. Kim Ho, the center's founder, praised Bondurant's work, stating, \"Ultimately the work and the fight was ours, but he stepped in at a critical time, and we're grateful for it.\"\n\nIn 1964, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bondurant's side, requiring states with more than one House representative to have districts with the same population. The ruling gave more power to urban and suburban areas, and it forced politicians to get more creative about how they draw districts, according to Smith.\n\n\"It's at that point then when the drive toward gerrymandering really starts to kick up to another notch,\" Smith said.\n\n55 years later, Bondurant is set to argue before the Supreme Court again. This time he's asking the court to block partisan redistricting in North Carolina, where the legislature ensured that Republicans would dominate the congressional delegation despite the state being closely politically divided. Bondurant has no plans to retire or quit trying to improve democracy in the country through the courts.\n\n\"I'd rather spend my time doing that than playing golf, in part because I play golf so badly that the opportunity not to play is itself a positive,\" Bondurant said. \"But, this is really important stuff, and it's very fundamental.\"",
    " Title: Colorado House Passes Limits on Ammunition Magazine Size and Universal Background Checks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Colorado House of Representatives passed bills on Monday, limiting the size of ammunition magazines and implementing universal background checks for gun purchases. The debates, which took place over two days, have attracted national attention as lawmakers attempt to address recent mass shootings.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House passed four bills amidst strong opposition from Republicans, who were joined by a few Democrats in some of the close votes. The proposed ammunition restrictions limit magazines to 15 rounds for firearms and eight for shotguns. The bill passed with a vote of 34-31.\n\nRepresentative Rhonda Fields, a Democratic sponsor of the bill and representative of the district where the shootings at an Aurora theater occurred last summer, stated, \"Enough is enough. I'm sick and tired of bloodshed.\" Fields' son was also fatally shot in 2005.\n\nRepublicans argued that the proposals infringe upon Second Amendment rights and will not prevent mass shootings, such as those in Aurora and a Connecticut elementary school. Republican Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg stated, \"This bill will never keep evil people from doing evil things.\"\n\nThe House also approved a bill requiring background checks on all gun purchases, including those between private sellers and firearms bought online. Other proposals would ban concealed firearms at colleges and stadiums, and another requires that gun purchasers pay for their own background checks.\n\nThe closest vote was on the background check measure, which passed with a vote of 33-32. Democratic Rep. Ed Vigil, who represents rural southern Colorado, voted against the four bills, stating his decision was rooted in the state's rugged history.\n\nThe Senate still needs to consider the proposals. Democrats will need to be more unified in their support there because their advantage is only 20-15, meaning Republicans need only three Democrats to join them to defeat the bills.\n\nHouse lawmakers began debating the bills on Friday. During the debate, Vice President Joe Biden called four Democrats, including two in moderate districts, to solidify support for the measures. Democratic Rep. Dominick Moreno, who represents a district in suburban Denver, was among the four lawmakers. He said Biden \"emphasized the importance of Colorado's role in shaping national policy around this issue.\"\n\nCastle Rock Republican Rep. Carole Murray brought up Biden's calls during Monday's debate, stating she did not appreciate \"East-coast politicians\" trying to influence Colorado legislators.\n\nDemocratic Gov. John Hickenlooper supports the expanded background checks and thinks gun buyers should pay for them. He also said he may support limits on the size of magazines, if lawmakers agree to a number between 15 and 20. He has not decided whether to support banning concealed firearms on campuses and stadiums.\n\nRepublicans argue that students should have the right to defend themselves. Republican Rep. Jim Wilson said, \"Do not disarm our young adults in general and our young women in particular on our college campuses in the name of a gun-free zone.\"\n\nThe gun debate highlights a fundamental philosophical difference between many Democrats and Republicans. Democratic Rep. Dickey Lee Hullinghorst, the Democrats' leader in the House, stated, \"I resent the implication that unless we all arm ourselves, we will not be adequately protected.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Christ Holbert became emotional while explaining his opposition to the bills. He said he understood Rep. Rhonda Fields' concern, given her district and her son's shooting in 2005, but stated, \"I care passionately about the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, and the oath that we have taken.\"",
    " Title: Biden Leads Among Voters Dissatisfied with Both Candidates in 2020 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2020 United States presidential race, presumed Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden is currently leading incumbent President Donald Trump among voters who view both candidates unfavorably. This trend is particularly noticeable among disgruntled voters in key states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump won by narrow margins in 2016.\n\nAccording to exit polls in 2016, approximately 1 in 5 voters in these states did not have a favorable opinion of their presidential options. Mr. Biden outperformed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton among these disillusioned voters by significant margins in Wisconsin (37 percentage points), Pennsylvania (25 points), and Michigan (21 points). These voters contributed to Mr. Trump's slim victories in their states, with the president carrying all three by fewer than 80,000 votes combined.\n\nRecent polls indicate that the same dissatisfied voters will be crucial this fall. Surveys from Monmouth University show that the share of respondents who do not have high opinions of either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden has been hovering around 20% since March. However, the most recent poll showed Mr. Biden besting Mr. Trump among this subset of voters by a 59% to 17% margin.\n\nPatrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, notes a shift in the composition of the \"dislike both\" group compared to the 2016 election. In 2016, these voters were evenly split between those leaning Democratic (42%) and those leaning Republican (40%). This year, an overwhelming 51% of \"favor neither\" voters lean Democratic, while 21% lean Republican.\n\nAnother difference between the two election cycles is that the pool of \"favor neither\" voters has shrunk because more Republicans appear to have picked sides, according to Mr. Murray. \"Either they have decided to like Trump or they no longer consider themselves Republican,\" he said.\n\nA Morning Consult poll of 27,754 registered voters released this month found Mr. Biden holding a 45% to 42% lead over Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden also holds a substantial lead among voters with unfavorable views of both candidates, with a 46% to 14% advantage.\n\nA recent OH Predictive Insights poll in Arizona, a state that Democrats have carried only once since 1972 (Bill Clinton in 1996), found Mr. Biden with a 50% to 43% edge over Mr. Trump among likely voters. The poll also shows Mr. Biden with a massive lead among voters who think their choices are unappealing. \"The gap in their support is striking,\" said Mike Noble of OH Predictive Insights, noting that more than six in ten (63%) of these voters say they would vote for Mr. Biden, while only 6% say they would vote for Mr. Trump.",
    " Title: Democratic Senators Coordinate Disruptions at Kavanaugh's Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday witnessed a series of disruptions, orchestrated by Democratic senators who aimed to delay the Supreme Court nomination process due to concerns about document access.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Kavanaugh delivered his opening statement, vowing to be a \"neutral and impartial arbiter\" after facing harsh criticisms from Democrats. Many Democrats attempted to object, delay, or adjourn the hearing, citing the lack of access to documents and time to review the files they had received.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., seemed to acknowledge the coordinated nature of the disruptions when asked by GOP Sen. Thom Tillis about reports that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a phone call over the holiday weekend discussing protest plans. Durbin stated that there was a phone conference where \"many issues were raised,\" including concerns about the release of over 100,000 documents related to Judge Kavanaugh and the committee's decision to classify these documents as \"committee confidential.\"\n\nAccording to Politico, citing unnamed sources, Democrats considered staging a mass walkout during the confirmation hearing. However, the party's top lawmakers decided against such a move, fearing the backlash from a made-for-TV moment would only help the Republican Party and impede any chances to stop the nomination of Kavanaugh.\n\nThe consideration of such a drastic move revealed a split between the party's more liberal wing, who wish to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh by any means necessary, and more senior Democrats, who believe the nomination should be defeated only by following rules and norms.\n\nYounger Democrats, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, disrupted Tuesday's hearing almost immediately and urged the committee to delay the hearing amid protests by liberal activists, some of whom were arrested. Harris received praise for her defiance of the chamber's norms.\n\nBy not staging a walkout, however, Democrats allowed themselves to become part of the process and question Kavanaugh in the upcoming hearings, hoping to mobilize opposition to his candidacy.\n\nThe obstructionist tactics, which may boost some lawmakers' reputations among the increasingly liberal base, may still backfire when it comes to the confirmation of Kavanaugh. Democrats ultimately need to convince moderate Republicans to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of the swing votes that could stop the nomination, dismissed Tuesday's protests as \"a lot of drama.\"\n\nAnother notable moment from Tuesday's hearing was when Fred Guttenberg, father of Jaime Guttenberg who was killed in the Parkland shooting, approached Kavanaugh for a handshake, only for the nominee to walk away. The committee's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, invited Guttenberg to sit in the audience, stating that he \"knows firsthand how Brett Kavanaugh's extreme views on guns could lead to more massacres.\" Guttenberg, however, stated that it was his decision to approach Kavanaugh.",
    " Title: Who Lost Egypt? A Look at U.S. Relations and the Arab Spring\n\nArticle:\n\nThe question of who lost Egypt has been a topic of discussion following the U.S. government's reported decision to reduce aid to Egypt against the wishes of key Arab allies and Israel. The answer can be traced back to June 4, 2009, with President Obama's speech, \"A New Beginning,\" at Cairo University, where he outlined his vision for U.S. relations in the Middle East.\n\nIn his speech, Obama expressed his belief in the yearning of people for freedom, the rule of law, and equal justice. Many in the Arab world took his words at face value, but the promises turned out to be hollow.\n\nJonathan Guyer, a senior editor of the Cairo Review of Global Affairs, wrote this week that contradictory diplomatic and military messages suggest a weakened U.S. in dealing with one of its closest allies in the Middle East. Guyer noted that Washington does not even know what it expects from Cairo.\n\nThe term \"Arab Spring,\" used to describe the wave of protests that swept across the Arab world in 2011, is a source of contention for many Egyptians and those familiar with the country. The term, apparently first used by the Christian Science Monitor and Foreign Policy, irked Arab writers like Rami Khouri of the Beirut-based Daily Star. He noted that the protesters themselves preferred the words revolution or \"thawra\" in Arabic, and awakening, or \"sahwa.\"\n\nThe term Arab Spring also rings hollow because it can refer to the failed Prague Spring of 1968, which Russian troops put down brutally, or the Spring of Nations in Europe of 1848, which also arguably resulted in little change.\n\nDuring Egypt's election campaign, many journalists and the Obama team failed to understand the Muslim Brotherhood, a group many reporters described as \"moderate.\" Mohammed Morsi, the head of a party backed by the Brotherhood, won roughly 25 percent of the votes in the first round of the elections in late May 2012. In a runoff election against a discredited crony of ousted President Hosni Mubarak, Ahmed Shafik, Morsi won 51.7 percent of the vote to 48.3 for Shafik. That's hardly a resounding endorsement.\n\nWithin months, Morsi essentially declared himself the supreme ruler of the country and led Egypt through the arrest and torture of opponents, along with the collapse of the economy that left many people without food. Western journalists and the Obama team described the Muslim Brotherhood as the democratically elected government. After 14 million Egyptians protested against the Brotherhood, the military took over, albeit with a heavy hand that I abhor.\n\nThe reduction in foreign aid to Egypt is likely to make relations significantly worse rather than bringing about democratic change\u2014if that is the administration's intention. The question of who lost Egypt is complex, but it can be argued that the Obama administration has made numerous errors, while Western journalists have played a significant role in losing one of our most important allies.",
    " Title: U.S. Proposes Collecting Social Media History from Visa Applicants for Enhanced Vetting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. State Department has proposed a new policy that would require nearly all visa applicants to disclose their social media identities used in the past five years. The proposal, which affects approximately 14.7 million people annually, would also request five years of telephone numbers, email addresses, and travel history.\n\nThe information gathered would be used to identify and vet those seeking both immigrant and non-immigrant visas. Applicants would also be asked if they had ever been deported from a country or if any relatives had been involved in terrorist activity.\n\nThe proposal does not apply to citizens from countries that the U.S. grants visa-free travel status, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Germany. However, citizens from non-exempt countries like India, China, and Mexico could be affected if they visit the U.S. for work or a holiday.\n\nOfficials have defended the proposal, stating it would help identify potential extremists. The proposal comes after the shootings in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, where authorities missed signs of radicalization in messages on a messaging platform sent between the attackers.\n\nUnder rules brought in last May, officials were told to seek social media handles only if they felt \"that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting.\" The tougher proposal comes after President Trump's promise to implement \"extreme vetting\" for foreigners entering the U.S., which he said was to combat terrorism.\n\nThe State Department stated, \"Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats.\" They further added, \"We already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.\"\n\nThe proposal is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget and will allow the public two months to comment before a decision is made. Civil liberties groups have condemned the policy as an invasion of privacy that could damage free speech.\n\n\"People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,\" said Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"We're also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term 'terrorist activities' because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe social media platforms covered in the proposal include US-based entities such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, and YouTube. The New York Times reports that overseas platforms such as China's Sina Weibo and Russia's VK social network would also be included.",
    " Title: Legal Expert Warns of \"Dangerous\" Impeachment Process Against President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nAn expert legal witness, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, testified Wednesday that the current legal case for impeaching President Trump is \"woefully inadequate\" and \"dangerous.\" The House Judiciary Committee held its first impeachment inquiry hearing.\n\nIn his opening statement, Turley expressed concern about the \"integrity\" of the impeachment process based on the case being built against Trump. He stated, \"One can oppose President Trump\u2019s policies or actions but still conclude that the current legal case for impeachment is not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous, as the basis for the impeachment of an American president.\"\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, which began in September, centers on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, Trump pressed Zelensky for investigations that could help him politically, including those relating to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nTurley argued that while Trump's comments about the Hunter Biden deal with Burisma are worthy of criticism, they do not constitute a case of bribery. He stated, \"The issue is not whether these comments are correct, but whether they are corrupt.\" Turley added that if Trump \"honestly believed that there was a corrupt arrangement with Hunter Biden that was not fully investigated by the Obama administration, the request for an investigation is not corrupt, notwithstanding its inappropriateness.\"\n\nTurley, a Republican witness, testified alongside three other legal scholars, all of whom are witnesses for the Democrats. The hearing is set to establish the stage for the next phase of the House impeachment inquiry into the president. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., announced the hearing, which will weigh whether the president\u2019s actions reach a level of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" and warrant articles of impeachment.\n\nThe president and counsel declined the invitation to participate in the hearing, as stated in a letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone. The hearing is expected to follow a similar format to the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s public hearings last month, with Democrats and Republicans given equal time to present their arguments.\n\nTrump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky prompted a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. Trump has challenged the accuracy of that complaint, though the transcript released by the White House did support the core allegations that he pressed for politically related investigations.\n\nThis week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., transmitted a report with the majority's findings from their inquiry, which concluded that Trump withheld nearly $391 million in military aid from Ukraine, conditioning its delivery as well as a White House visit for Zelensky on a public announcement that he was conducting investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden's, business dealings in Ukraine, as well as issues related to the 2016 election. The Democrats' report also accuses Trump of committing obstruction by instructing witnesses not to comply with congressional subpoenas.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee drafted a report of their own, which rejected Democrats' claims, stating there is no evidence for impeachment.",
    " Title: U.S. and U.K. Pledge to Pursue \"Phenomenal\" Post-Brexit Trade Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed his commitment to a significant post-Brexit trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom during his state visit to London. At a joint news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump stated, \"As the UK makes preparations to exit the European Union, the United States is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between the US and the UK.\"\n\nTrump suggested that the potential trade between the two countries could be two to three times the current amount. May, who is stepping down as head of her Conservative Party this week, has faced criticism for her handling of Brexit. The new prime minister will be responsible for achieving Brexit and any bilateral trade deal with the U.S.\n\nTrump praised both Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit supporter, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign minister, during the news conference. He expressed his support for Johnson, stating, \"I know Boris, I like him, I've liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job.\" Trump also expressed his appreciation for Hunt, saying, \"I know Jeremy, I think he'd do a very good job.\"\n\nThe issue of Huawei's involvement in 5G networks was discussed, with Trump stating that he would work out any differences with the U.K. regarding security cooperation. The Trump administration has advised allies to avoid using Huawei's 5G technology due to concerns about potential Chinese espionage. Huawei denies these allegations.\n\nTrump's state visit, initially promised in January 2017, is intended to celebrate the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K., boost trade links, and reaffirm security cooperation. The visit has been criticized for potentially embarrassing May, but Trump steered clear of such rhetoric during the visit.\n\nMay praised the \"precious and profound\" alliance between the two nations but acknowledged that friends could also disagree, as demonstrated by their differing stances on the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. The U.K. continues to support the international agreement aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions, while the U.S. has withdrawn from the deal. May also emphasized the importance of cooperation and compromise in strong alliances.",
    " Title: Media Outlets Facing Financial Struggles Amid Anti-Trump Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe financial struggles of several media outlets, including The Weekly Standard and Vice, have been reported, with some outlets looking for buyers or reevaluating their strategies in a bid to become profitable. The Weekly Standard, a 28-year-old neoconservative institution, is reportedly heading towards dissolution, following its founder, Bill Kristol's, three-year focus on attacking President Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe same week that The Weekly Standard's troubles broke, Vanity Fair published a report about the struggles faced by left-wing, millennial-targeted digital media outlets with a focus on anti-Trump content, such as Vice, Vox, Mic, Buzzfeed, and Mashable. These outlets are either looking for buyers or significantly reevaluating their strategies. Mic laid off most of its workers, while Vice and Vox are reportedly firing staff.\n\nCable TV network CNN has also been criticized for devoting its resources to a relentless, partisan crusade against President Trump. CNN's ratings have suffered, with the network falling behind both the Hallmark Channel and Home and Garden Television in October.\n\nThe financial struggles of these media outlets, which have focused on attacking President Trump, have been dubbed as a \"resistance\" media strategy. The strategy, however, has been criticized for being corrosive to the country and a losing business model.\n\nKristol, a neoconservative hero during the George W. Bush administration, was the editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard, which was one of the most important conservative outlets. However, during the 2016 campaign, Kristol became determined to oppose President Trump, promising a major, serious third-party candidate to defeat both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Despite most of the Republican Party coming together to elect Trump, Kristol continued his anti-Trump crusade, even going as far as to primary pro-Trump Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz with a Never Trump challenger.\n\nKristol's relentless anti-Trump campaign has been criticized as ego, obsession, and farce, as President Trump delivered victory after victory on issues Kristol long claimed to care about. Despite Kristol's continued threats against President Trump, it appears that the bulk of The Weekly Standard's funding will be reassigned to its sister publication, The Washington Examiner.\n\nJeff Ballabon, CEO of B2 Strategic, a political advisor, media consultant, and former CBS executive, has commented on the financial struggles of these media outlets, stating that building resistance credentials by demonizing President Trump is not only lousy for journalism, but also terrible for business.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Advocates for Iran Nuclear Deal, Criticizes U.S. Foreign Policy at Democratic Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first Democratic debate of the 2020 presidential campaign, Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) distinguished herself by advocating for the United States to rejoin the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and criticizing the country's foreign policy.\n\nWhen asked about rejoining the Iran nuclear deal, Gabbard, a veteran of the Iraq War, responded with an unequivocal \"yes.\" She warned about the potential consequences of war, stating, \"War with Iran would be worse than war with Iraq.\" Gabbard criticized President Donald Trump and his advisors, including Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others, for creating a situation that could lead to a war with Iran.\n\nGabbard's position contrasted with the other candidates on stage. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) stated that he would not automatically re-enter the Iran deal, suggesting a better deal could be negotiated. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) expressed a desire to reenter the deal but also advocated for stricter terms. Klobuchar also emphasized that any war with Iran would require congressional authorization.\n\nThroughout the night, Gabbard kept the focus on the U.S.'s aggressive foreign policy. When asked about the gender pay gap, Gabbard declined to answer the moderators' question, instead choosing to denounce the country's interventionist foreign policy.\n\nLater in the debate, when Representative Tim Ryan (D-OH) referenced the recent deaths of two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan as a reason to continue the war in the country, Gabbard responded, \"Will you tell the parents of those two soldiers that we have to be engaged? That is unacceptable. We have lost so many lives, we have spent so much money.\"\n\nGabbard's single-minded focus on war and peace has been a central theme of her longshot campaign from the beginning. When announcing her intention to run to CNN's Van Jones, Gabbard stated, \"There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace.\"\n\nThis focus on foreign policy is unlikely to win her many votes, given the predominance of domestic policy in the debate and the Democratic primary as a whole. However, Gabbard's willingness to prioritize foreign policy over a softball, red meat question about raising wages for women was a refreshing moment amidst the otherwise dreary, shockingly left-wing rhetoric from the rest of the Democratic field on stage tonight.",
    " Title: Lame-Duck Speaker John Boehner Clears the Way for Budget Agreement Ahead of House Speaker Election\n\nArticle:\n\nJust days before the election of a new speaker of the House, outgoing Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, has fulfilled his promise to \"clear the barn\" for his successor. In a swift move, two contentious issues were resolved: raising the debt ceiling by next Tuesday and reaching a budget agreement.\n\nShortly before midnight, a 144-page budget resolution was submitted to the House Rules Committee. The tentative agreement increases federal spending by $80 billion over the next two years, with half of the increase allocated to defense programs and the other half to domestic programs. The agreement also includes cuts to Medicare and Social Security disability benefits to help offset the spending increase. Additionally, the deal lifts the debt ceiling until March 2017.\n\nRep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., expressed support for the deal, stating, \"This is one of those moments when it's important that leadership step in and take the ball and run with it.\"\n\nHowever, as details of the agreement leaked, many hard-line conservatives objected to being excluded from the negotiations. The deal was reportedly reached in talks that involved only five parties: the top two Republicans in Congress, the top two Democrats, and the White House.\n\nRep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., criticized the process, saying, \"This is what we've been going through for five years, where the leadership team negotiate a deal without speaking to any members of the [Republican] conference\u2014apparently not even the committee chairmen who are in key positions\u2014and then expect all of us to vote for it.\"\n\nWhile Boehner hopes \"clearing the barn\" will make his successor's job easier, some members of the Republican caucus argue that his presumptive heir\u2014Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin\u2014will inherit a deal many Republicans are already criticizing. They contend that Ryan should have been involved in the negotiations.\n\nHowever, Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, believes it is beneficial that Ryan's fingerprints are not on this budget deal. \"I think this somewhat insulates Paul [Ryan],\" said Flores. \"But I still believe if there's somebody that does not like this and they're passionate about it, that they'll take out their feelings on Paul.\"\n\nThe House could vote on this budget agreement as early as Wednesday, the same day Republicans are expected to officially nominate Ryan as the next speaker.",
    " Title: Candidates Obama and Romney Campaign in Iowa and Nevada Ahead of November 6 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nWith 13 days remaining until the November 6 election, both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, included trips to Iowa and Nevada on their schedules. Each candidate aimed to energize their supporters and cast doubts about the other in a race that appears to be tied.\n\nAt rallies in Davenport, Iowa, and Denver, Colorado, President Obama employed attack lines he has used in recent days against the former Massachusetts governor. He referred to one of his latest jibes against Romney as \"Romnesia,\" suggesting that his opponent forgets his past positions due to this condition.\n\nObama stated, \"I want to go over the symptoms with you, Davenport, because I don't want you to catch it. I do not\u2014I\u2014I do not want it to spread. If you say you won't give a big tax cut to the wealthy but you're caught on video promising your tax cut would include the top 1 percent, then you might have 'Romnesia.' If you talk about how much you love teachers during a debate, but just a few weeks ago you said we should not hire anymore teachers because they won't grow the economy, you probably have 'Romnesia.'\"\n\nObama also attempted to counter Romney's charge that he lacks a second-term agenda by pointing voters to a plan his campaign made public this week.\n\nIn Reno, Nevada, a state that was hit hard by the housing market collapse, Romney stayed with his main economic argument as to why he should be elected president instead of Obama.\n\nRomney said, \"I\u2014I was just a few days ago speaking with a\u2014a man. As I recall, he was in his 50s. And he said that the job he used to have was at $25 an hour plus benefits. But the job he has now is $9 an hour without benefits. And he said, you know, I'm showing up on the employment rolls, but my life has changed dramatically.\"\n\nObama has consistently led Romney in state polls in Nevada, though his lead has generally been within the margin of error. Similarly, several Iowa polls have given the president a slight lead or show the race as tied.\n\nOn Obama's schedule for Wednesday was a trip to Burbank, California, for a taping of the Tonight show with Jay Leno and a stop in Nevada where Romney had been earlier in the day.\n\nThe president's midweek travels were part of a 48-hour campaign blitz meant to energize his voters. Besides Iowa and Colorado, the president was scheduled to hit Florida, Ohio, and Virginia with a stopover in Chicago where he hoped to set an example for others by voting early.\n\nFor his part, Romney had Iowa on his Wednesday schedule as well, while his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, was in Cleveland delivering a speech on upward mobility.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama campaign officials on Wednesday tried to undo a minor but gratuitous mess they created by changing their minds and releasing a transcript of Obama's interview with Des Moines Register executives, part of the president's effort to seek the endorsement of that newspaper's editorial board. The president gave the interview on the condition that it would be off-the-record. A similar interview with Romney was done on-the-record.\n\nThe Romney campaign had a bigger mess to deal with: continued fallout from a comment by Richard Mourdock, a Republican candidate in Indiana running for U.S. Senate. Mourdock, who is backed by the Tea Party, caused a ruckus by saying during a debate Tuesday that pregnancies caused by rapes are \"intended\" by God.\n\nRomney's campaign distanced itself from Mourdock's statement, but there were calls for the Republican nominee to take further action because he appears in an ad endorsing Mourdock.\n\nThen there was Donald Trump. The reality show star, real-estate developer, and celebrity birther on Wednesday offered $5 million to the charity of Obama's choice if the president makes public his college transcript and U.S. passport.\n\nWhite House and Obama campaign spokespeople indicated they would not be taking up Trump on his offer.",
    " Title: Al Smith Dinner: Trump and Clinton's Friendly Roast Turns into a Contentious Exchange\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, traditionally a time for presidential candidates to offer light-hearted jokes about themselves and their opponent, turned into a contentious exchange between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump on Thursday.\n\nTrump, who spoke first, seemed to struggle with maintaining a comedic tone throughout his speech. He joked about the politicians who had previously supported him before his presidential campaign, stating, \"Suddenly, [they] decided when I ran for president as a Republican that I've always been a no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel. And they totally forgot about me.\"\n\nOne of Trump's jokes that resonated was his comment about Clinton's ongoing email server saga. \"And even tonight, with all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil with each other. In fact, just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, 'Pardon me.'\"\n\nTrump also joked about his comment from the final debate in Las Vegas where he called Clinton a \"nasty woman.\" \"But this stuff is all relative,\" he said. \"After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I do not think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's speech took a more serious tone when he called Clinton corrupt several times, and not in a joking manner. \"Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private.\" This remark drew boos from the crowd.\n\nClinton, known for her ability to laugh off jabs, smiled throughout Trump's speech but let her opponent have it when it was her turn. She ribbed Trump over his recent allegations that the election might be rigged, and that he may not accept the results of the vote. \"It's amazing I'm up here after Donald,\" Clinton said. \"I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power.\"\n\nClinton mocked Trump for talking over her during the debates, and she mocked Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, for defending Trump to no end. She mocked Trump on the way he talks about women's looks, saying he'd rank the Statue of Liberty \"a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.\"\n\nThe Clinton line that drew the most laughs might have been her take on Trump's debate performance and the drama he provided before it even started. \"Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind,\" Clinton said. \"Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate... I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer. Now, actually, I did. It's called preparation.\"\n\nAfter pausing for laughter, Clinton added, \"And looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates, and he says I do not have any stamina!\"\n\nOne needed much stamina to endure the night's sometimes cringe-worthy moments. Though Trump provided almost all of them, Clinton's more traditional speech could not lift the awkward mood of the event. If the Al Smith Dinner in previous years has served as a respite from bitter campaign seasons, this year it may have failed to do so.\n\nThere was at least one bright spot, though. Clinton and Trump did shake hands before the event was done, an announcement that was made from the stage, to applause.",
    " Title: Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski Criticize Mitch McConnell's Coordination with White House on Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his statement that he is in \"total coordination\" with the White House regarding the ongoing impeachment trial.\n\nIn an interview with Maine Public Radio, Sen. Collins expressed her disapproval of senators on both sides of the aisle who have allegedly prejudged the evidence before hearing the presented evidence. She specifically named McConnell and Sen. Elizabeth Warren for their comments.\n\n\"It is inappropriate, in my judgment, for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence before they have heard what is presented to us, because each of us will take an oath, an oath that I take very seriously, to render impartial justice,\" Collins said. \"And I have heard Democrats like Elizabeth Warren saying that the President should be impeached, found guilty, and removed from office. I've heard the Senate majority leader saying that he's taking his cues from the White House. There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging that's in an impartial way.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Murkowski expressed her disapproval of McConnell's comments on coordinating strategy with the White House. \"When I heard that, I was disturbed,\" Murkowski told KTUU last week. \"We have to take that step back from being hand in glove with the defense, and so I heard what leader McConnell had said, I happened to think that that has further confused the process.\"\n\nCollins also stated that she is \"open\" to calling witnesses in the trial, although she said it would be \"premature to decide who should be called\" until the evidence is presented. Democrats have stepped up their call for witnesses after a New York Times report detailing how Trump's order to put a hold on Ukraine aid was handled within the White House.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference on Monday, \"Simply put: In our fight to have key documents and witnesses in a Senate impeachment trial, these new revelations are a game-changer.\" McConnell has stated that the trial should not include witnesses.",
    " Title: Protesters Call for Regulation of Self-Defense Rights; Opponents Vow to Exercise Rights Despite Potential Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nStudents, teachers, and other Americans are participating in protests across the country, advocating for greater regulation of self-defense rights. The protesters are exercising their free speech rights during the demonstrations, as they should, though some students may be unwillingly participating due to school officials endorsing specific positions.\n\nThe protesters' demands for self-defense regulations are based on the belief that individual rights should be subject to popular opinion or debate. However, many libertarians and classical liberals argue that individuals are sovereign beings free to act as they please, so long as they do not cause harm to others. This perspective is rooted in the harm principle, a concept popularized by philosopher John Stuart Mill, who stated that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against their will, is to prevent harm to others.\n\nThose who value self-defense rights and individual liberty argue that the potential for causing harm is inherent in the exercise of liberty and is not enough to justify government action. They believe that their rights are not open to discussion, even when they are exercising their rights to call for limiting others.\n\nIf the protesters' demands result in legislative action imposing restrictions on gun ownership and self-defense, those who value these rights will not necessarily change their conduct. They argue that laws are not like the law of gravity, and people can choose to abide by them or actively oppose them and sabotage their enforcement.\n\nThe willingness of individuals to disobey such laws has a clear history. Residents of Connecticut and New York, for example, have defied requirements to register their so-called \"assault weapons.\" Gun owners in Colorado have ignored mandates that they pass all their person-to-person sales through the background check system. Even in countries with stricter gun laws, such as France and Germany, people own millions of illegal firearms that supporters of restrictions wish they did not have.\n\nExercising liberty in defiance of restrictive laws is seen as a positive action, as it places limits on the power of the state. The military recognizes this, instructing officers not to give orders that will not be obeyed. People's unwillingness to submit is what made Prohibition fail, and it hobbled the similar ban on marijuana. Even taxes are dependent on people's willingness to pay, as there is always the option to work and do business off the books.\n\nWhile every tax dodger, dope-smoker, and moonshine-sipper may not explicitly reference John Stuart Mill's harm principle when they scoff at government actions they find intrusive and oppressive, the constituents of political systems seem to instinctively place limits on what they are willing to tolerate from the powers-that-be. This is evident in surveys reporting that, even among people who are supposedly thrilled to be taxed to the hilt, \"80 percent of all Danes interviewed for the 2010 study either had or would have engaged in the black market economy.\" The World Health Organization found that \"the United States leads the world in rates of experimenting with marijuana and cocaine despite strict drug laws.\" This data is a significant factor in the loosening of marijuana laws, as the country gives up on restrictions that many Americans defy.\n\nThe protesters' right to voice their opinions is not disputed, as it is one of the rights that is not subject to popular opinion or debate. The author wishes the protesters good weather and a pleasant experience. However, it is important to recognize that, just as the protesters would never try to impose limits on the liberty of others, those who value self-defense rights and individual liberty will never submit to the restrictions that the protesters demand.",
    " Title: China Prepares to Welcome Trump with State Visit-Plus Experience\n\nArticle:\n\nChina is preparing to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump with a state visit-plus experience, according to Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai. The visit, starting on Wednesday, will mark Trump's first state visit to China since taking office.\n\nThe \"plus\" aspect of the visit remains unclear, but it is expected that Trump will visit the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops. The protocol is intended to provide Trump with a grandiose experience, according to Teng Jianqun, head of American Studies at Foreign Ministry think-tank China Institute for International Studies.\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang stated that China would create a good atmosphere for the two presidents, allowing ample time for discussions on important issues. In April, during their last meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, the two leaders found common ground, with Trump praising the \"good chemistry\" of the summit and Xi's political thoughts being enshrined in the Communist Party's constitution.\n\nTrade remains an irritant in U.S.-China relations, with Trump citing it as a one-way street and expressing hopes for better trade terms. On the commercial front, the visit is expected to result in a slew of deals, potentially placating Trump with contract wins rather than addressing long-standing complaints over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions.\n\nThe WeChat account of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily marked China's announcement of Trump's visit with a picture of a beaming Trump and the headline \"Trump's coming!\". Trump is a popular figure in China, admired for his business acumen, and is not the divisive figure he is in the United States and its allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nThe contrast between the two leaders was set at the start of the year, with Xi delivering a vigorous defense of globalization at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership his first week in office. However, Trump has put aside his grievances about China's trade and currency practices to get China behind his strategy of punishing sanctions on North Korea for its escalating missile and nuclear tests.\n\nTrump's 12-day trip to Asia, the longest by a U.S. president in a quarter-century, will give him a chance to reassure friends and allies in the region, who have expressed uncertainty about his \"America First\" policies. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has already signaled the limits of Washington's patience with China, criticizing China for its \"predatory economics\" and \"provocative actions in the South China Sea\". At last month's party congress, Xi laid out a vision for a prosperous and assertive China taking a bigger place on the global stage.",
    " Title: Obama's Final State of the Union Address: A Reflection on the Speech and Its Historical Significance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final State of the Union address, President Barack Obama delivered a speech that, according to a long-time observer and former White House staffer, failed to inspire or inform the nation about the real state of the union. The observer noted that the speech was disjointed, irrelevant, and disappointing, and that it resembled a political campaign speech rather than a State of the Union address.\n\nThe observer recalled the historical significance of the State of the Union address, describing it as an opportunity for a dramatic speech to the nation and the world. The speech is traditionally a recap of what has been accomplished and an agenda for the future. The observer noted that the excitement of the president going to Capitol Hill to address the nation, standing before the other branches of the government, and delivering the State of the Union was a significant part of the drama.\n\nThe observer also highlighted the grand entrance of the president into the House of Representatives, where he is often mobbed by members trying to shake his hand or pat his back. The repeated standing and applauding for key phrases that appeal to partisans in his party and the negative responses from the opposition were also mentioned.\n\nThe observer noted that the speech was not a reflection of the real state of the union, as it did not set an agenda for Obama's final year or for his legacy. The observer also criticized Obama for failing to explain how the goals he set could be accomplished and for failing to address the Iranian Navy's capture of two US Navy ships that allegedly drifted into Iranian waters on the very day the president delivered his speech.\n\nThe observer also noted that the speech was delivered on the same day that Iran fired unguided missiles at the USS Harry S. Truman, an aircraft carrier in the same waters. The observer expressed concern that the president's dismissal of terrorism as a top problem and his continued focus on closing the Guantanamo prison, despite strong objections from the Congress, the military, and law enforcement officers, was a mistake.\n\nThe observer also noted that the speech was not remembered as a historic presidency and that the country is desperately looking for new leadership. The observer concluded by stating that the speech will be historically irrelevant.",
    " Title: House GOP Takes Action to Limit Nationwide Injunctions in Federal Courts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill have taken action to address the growing practice of federal judges issuing nationwide injunctions, which has reportedly stymied President Trump's agenda during his tenure. The Department of Justice issued new guidance to government attorneys, stating they should argue vigorously in court against nationwide injunctions. The House Judiciary Committee also approved legislation to curb nationwide injunctions.\n\nThe Injunctive Authority Clarification Act, proposed by panel Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), aims to instruct judges to write rulings that apply only to the individuals, organizations, or entities that are part of the lawsuit in front of them. The bill would limit the scope of nationwide injunctions, which often halt presidential initiatives, programs, or actions.\n\nThe federal judiciary operates as an independent branch of government, but Congress retains significant authority under the Constitution to write rules governing federal courts, including questions of procedure, organization, and jurisdiction. It is unclear how the courts would view legislation like that of Mr. Goodlatte, which limits the kinds of rulings they can issue and the scope of how they decide cases.\n\nChairman Goodlatte, who approved the bill sent through his committee, stated, \"The Constitution gives courts the authority to decide cases for the parties before them, not to act as super-legislators for everyone across the country based on a single case.\" He further added, \"I am pleased that the House Judiciary Committee today approved the Injunctive Authority Clarification Act of 2018 to restore the proper balance of power between the branches of government and I look forward to a vote by the full House of Representatives soon.\"\n\nThe Trump White House's initiative to roll back the constitutionally questionable Obama era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order is another point of contention within the Republican Party and the courts. The Injunctive Authority Clarification Act is part of the ongoing efforts to address the challenges posed by nationwide injunctions in the federal court system.",
    " Title: U.S. Pursuit of Greenland: Historical Context and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States' recent interest in purchasing Greenland, as suggested by President Donald Trump, has sparked debate and skepticism, particularly from the political left. While it may seem unconventional, the United States has indeed explored the possibility of acquiring Greenland in the past.\n\nIn 1946, under President Harry Truman, U.S. Secretary of State James Byrnes discussed the idea of purchasing Greenland with the Danish foreign minister during a United Nations meeting in New York. The proposal did not result in any concrete actions. Prior to this, in 1867, Secretary of State William Seward, who had recently overseen the U.S.'s purchase of Alaska, reportedly considered buying Greenland from the Danes.\n\nGreenland is believed to be rich in natural resources, including iron ore, lead, zinc, diamonds, gold, rare earth elements, uranium, and oil. A significant portion of these resources remains untapped due to the extensive ice coverage in the country, which is rapidly melting due to global warming.\n\nThe potential acquisition of Greenland, if driven by indifference to environmental issues and indigenous rights, could be seen as an example of profit-driven perspectives on climate change. Greenland is home to approximately 56,000 people, and the idea of buying an indigenous people's ancestral lands is problematic and reminiscent of colonialism.\n\nIt is important to note that private land ownership does not exist in Greenland. In 2017, a sheep farmer in southern Greenland built a new pasture by following local procedures, demonstrating the communal nature of land use in the region. Additionally, Greenland's healthcare industry is nationalized, with both medical care and prescription drugs being free.\n\nDenmark, which runs a budget surplus, has no reason to sell Greenland. The Greenlandic population is unlikely to want to switch their allegiance. Instead, the U.S. would be better off working closely and constructively with European allies, such as Denmark and Norway, to protect U.S. interests in the Arctic. Such cooperation can be more economically beneficial than territorial expansion.\n\nTrump's defenders argue that the evidence of his intentions is circumstantial, but they acknowledge that circumstantial evidence can be strong evidence. The context and circumstances of the situation are likely to become the focus of any investigation. Whether this evidence is sufficient to lead to impeachment or removal remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Bolton's Allegations Cast Shadow Over Trump Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer National Security Adviser John Bolton's claims that President Donald Trump withheld aid to Ukraine until it helped with investigations into Joe Biden are causing controversy in the ongoing impeachment trial. According to a report by The New York Times on Sunday, in his upcoming book, Bolton alleges that Trump told him he did not want to release military aid to Ukraine until that country helped with investigations that could damage Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBolton's lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, provided a copy of the book to the Trump administration on Dec. 30 to be reviewed for classified information. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly did not have any advance notice that the National Security Council had a copy of Bolton's manuscript for weeks.\n\nMcConnell, who has expressed his coordination with the White House on the impeachment trial, is said to be \"angry\" at the White House over the revelations about Bolton's manuscript, according to The Times. Mere hours before the impeachment trial was set to resume on Monday, McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., privately pressed the president's advisers to explain Bolton's account, which undermines a White House defense of the president and blindsided several GOP senators, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n\nTrump refuted Bolton's account, tweeting out early Monday morning, \"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.\"\n\nCNN's John King said Monday that McConnell, as the \"leader in the middle of something incredibly delicate who does not like to be blindsided,\" has questions for the White House. Behind closed doors for a luncheon Monday, McConnell told his colleagues to \"take a deep breath and let's take one step at a time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McConnell's fellow Kentucky Republican senator, Rand Paul, suggested in an interview with the Washington Examiner on Monday that Bolton was trying to use the attention he's getting as a potential witness to make more money off his forthcoming book. The state's junior senator called Bolton a \"disgruntled, angry man\" who should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nTrump's alleged participation in a quid pro quo with Ukraine is at the center of the impeachment trial that began this month in the Senate, and whether to call witnesses, including Bolton, to testify has been a contentious issue. As Senate majority leader, McConnell has influence over what happens with the trial, and he has expressed skepticism about the need to have additional witness testimony during the proceedings.\n\nDemocrats need at least four members of the 53-member Republican majority to vote with them to call witnesses. One possible defector, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters Monday that \"it's important to be able to hear from John Bolton for us to be able to make an impartial judgment.\"\n\nAnother potential swing vote, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement Monday that \"the reports about John Bolton's book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues.\"\n\nThe impeachment trial's outcome remains uncertain, and the Senate is expected to continue deliberations this week. The allegations made by Bolton and other witnesses could potentially sway the opinions of undecided senators and impact the final verdict.",
    " Title: House Freedom Caucus and Sen. Rand Paul Oppose Obamacare Replacement Bill, Introduce Alternative Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), have denounced the Obamacare replacement bill supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and announced the filing of Paul's own bill, sponsored in the House by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nDuring a press conference, Paul stated, \"There is one thing that has united Republicans in 2010, when we won the House; in 2014, when we won the Senate; and 2016 when we won the White House.\" He was flanked by members of the House Freedom Caucus, including the caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jordan, the previous HFC chairman.\n\nPaul emphasized that a clean repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), similar to the bill that every House and Senate Republican voted for in 2015, should not divide Republicans. Jordan stated that to bring down costs and improve medical care, Congress must repeal Obamacare completely.\n\nJordan explained that the first step is to vote on the 2015 bill. Paul, a former eye surgeon, stated that in 2017, Republicans are united in supporting complete repeal, but they are divided on how, if at all, to replace the 2010 PPACA.\n\n\"Conservatives have a replacement plan. House leadership has a replacement plan,\" said Paul. \"Vote on all the replacement plans and let's see what happens.\" Jordan described the plan supported by Ryan and the House Republican leadership as Obamacare in a different form.\n\n\"Then, there is our plan,\" he said. \"It is the one that I think is consistent with what we told the voters we're going to do: Repeal Obamacare and replace it with a market-centered, patient-centered, and doctor-centered plan that actually brings down the cost of insurance.\"\n\nIn 2015, Republicans put a bill on President Barack Obama's desk that repealed Obamacare, got rid of every single tax, and got rid of the mandate, according to Jordan. Obama vetoed that bill, which was sponsored by then-Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.)\u2014now the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nComparing what happened in 2015 with the course that Ryan and the Republican leadership have set out on, Jordan stated, \"Now, the first thing that Republicans are bringing forward is a piece of legislation that we are going to put on a Republican president's desk, that doesn't repeal it, but keeps Medicaid expansion\u2014and actually expands it\u2014that keeps some of the tax increases. That is not what we promised the American people we would do.\"\n\nMeadows stated that repealing Obamacare meant repealing all of Obamacare, all of the fees, taxes, and mandates. He added that all Obamacare replacement bills will be subject to scoring by the Congressional Budget Office. \"But there is one score that the American people will pay attention to: Does it really lower their health care costs and their premiums? That's the only score that really matters, and if this doesn't do it, we better find something that does,\" according to Meadows.\n\nPaul told reporters that in the House, the score that counts is 218 votes. If the GOP leadership has 218 votes, then they will pass their bill and move on, he said. If the GOP leadership does not have 218 votes, then they have to find the votes and they will have to talk to conservatives, the senator said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence added to the day's drama when he met with members of the House Freedom Caucus after having his regular Tuesday lunch with GOP senators. Virginia Republican Rep. David Brat told reporters that the meeting with Pence was very direct and focused because both Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who was traveling with Pence, are men of the House.\n\nBrat stated he told Price that he needs to convince people on the Hill that regulations on insurance companies will be adjusted to make sense. Case in point, the congressman said: it is not legal for a 25-year-old male to buy a cheap insurance plan that only covers catastrophic illness and injury. \"Right now, that kid has to buy a gold-plated that covers every health scenario under the sun.\"\n\nThe White House put out a statement about the meeting: \"The Vice President today met with conservative leaders in the House to discuss the failures of Obamacare and the need to repeal and replace that disastrous law. Participants discussed their shared desire for fiscally responsible, market-based reforms that encourage competition and provide individuals and families with the ability to choose the health insurance option that is best for them. The Vice President stressed this is the first step in the process to deliver on the President's promise to the American people and looks forward to House passage of the American Health Care Act.\"\n\nThe American Health Care Act is the name of the bill supported by House GOP leadership.",
    " Title: New York Times, Quinnipiac, and CBS News Poll Shows Obama Leading in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll conducted by The New York Times, Quinnipiac, and CBS News has shown that President Barack Obama holds an advantage over Mitt Romney in the key battleground states of Florida and Ohio, with a lead of 6 percentage points in each state. In Pennsylvania, the president is leading by 11 percentage points. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points in each state.\n\nThe poll is part of a series tracking the presidential contest in six states over the next three months. In addition to Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania, which have a combined 67 electoral votes, surveys will be taken in Colorado, Wisconsin, and Virginia, which have 32 electoral votes. Four years ago, Mr. Obama won all six states.\n\nMr. Romney is campaigning in each state, with his strategists viewing the efforts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as the most ambitious. These two states, which have voted for the Democratic presidential candidate over the last two decades, are considered firewalls, and an erosion of support would signal trouble for the president.\n\nThe poll found that Mr. Obama faces substantial hurdles, most of them rooted in the electorate's deeply pessimistic outlook on the economy. By double-digit margins, voters in each state say his policies would hurt, rather than help, their personal financial situation if he wins re-election, a worrisome sign considering the economy is ranked as voters' chief concern.\n\nStill, more than half of voters in each state also say the administration's actions are either slowly improving the economy or will, if given more time.\n\n\"Romney does have business experience, but I wonder if his business experience would benefit the country or might harm it,\" said Peg Pagano, 72, a retiree in Holland, Pa., in a follow-up interview. \"He was in business in order to make a profit. There's nothing wrong with that, but how would that help the country? I feel Obama needs to be given another four years.\"\n\nIn all three states, most women say they prefer Mr. Obama. About half of female voters in Florida back him, while his support is even stronger in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where nearly 6 in 10 women say they favor him. In Ohio, men prefer Mr. Romney, while they are more closely split in Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe economy is the top concern in all three states. However, voters in Ohio express more optimism about their own backyard, with 33 percent saying their economy is improving, compared with 23 percent in Florida. Ohio's unemployment rate, 7.2 percent, is the lowest of the three states and below the national rate.\n\nA sliver of voters, 4 percent in each state, say they are undecided between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. Only about one in 10 who have picked a candidate say they could change their minds, fewer than some polls showed at this point in previous races.\n\nMr. Obama has a clear advantage on personal measures, and far more voters say he cares about the needs and problems of people like them. Mr. Romney is seen as being able to do a comparable job on the economy. More voters in Florida say his economic policies would be better for their own financial situations. Among independent voters in the state, the poll found Mr. Romney outpacing Mr. Obama by 14 percentage points when asked who would perform better on the economy.\n\n\"We've seen Romney's track record with the Olympics and with his business, and I think that's what really swayed me,\" said Chris Rench, 47, who recently left his job as an equipment operator from Piqua, Ohio. \"And I haven't seen anything in his past that has been questionable. There is nothing to make me doubt his ability to do the things he says he wants to do.\"\n\nThe president drew broad support from voters in each state for a proposal to raise income taxes on people whose household income is more than $250,000. The plan received the backing of 58 percent of likely voters in Florida, 60 percent in Ohio, and 62 percent in Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Romney has endured criticism for declining to release more than two years of his tax returns, and at least half the voters, including about half the independent voters, in each state say presidential candidates should release several years of returns.\n\nThe state polls were conducted by telephone, both landlines and cellphones, from July 24 through July 30 among 1,177 likely voters in Florida, 1,193 likely voters in Ohio, and 1,168 likely voters in Pennsylvania. The findings cannot be compared with previous surveys because the polls are a measure of people who are likely to vote, rather than those who are simply registered. While the intensity of the race is high, it remains an open question how much the summer campaigning will influence the outcome. Tens of millions of dollars have been invested on television advertising in the states, but most voters say they are not swayed by the commercials.",
    " Title: Evidence Emerges of Russian Military and Intelligence Involvement in Eastern Ukraine Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Ukrainian interim government has presented evidence suggesting that Russian military and intelligence forces are instigating the unrest in the eastern part of the country, which has been destabilized since Russia's annexation of Crimea last month. The New York Times reports that photos and descriptions circulated by the Kiev government show that some of the so-called \"green men\" - gunmen who have seized government buildings and demanded Crimea-style referendums on becoming part of Russia - have been identified in other photos as being among Russian troops.\n\nOne of the men identified is Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, a veteran Russian military and intelligence operative. Strelkov is believed to have served Russia undercover both in Crimea and in the city of Slovyansk, one of the centers of the most recent unrest. Last week, Ukrainian authorities released a wanted poster for Mr. Strelkov, accompanied by a pencil sketch of his gaunt face.\n\nThe Obama administration has endorsed the Ukrainians' claims, stating that Russia could face new economic sanctions if government buildings currently occupied by demonstrators are not vacated under the terms of an agreement reached Thursday among Russian, Ukrainian, American, and European diplomats. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to arrive in Ukraine Monday morning to meet with Ukraine's interim prime minister and president, as well as other officials.\n\nRussian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly denied that Russian forces are involved in the unrest, which began after the February deposition of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The separatists themselves claim that their movement is entirely homegrown and in response to what they consider an illegal coup that resulted in Yanukovych's downfall.\n\nThe unit accused of operating in eastern Ukraine is known as the GRU, the Russian acronym for the Main Intelligence Department of the Russian General Staff. This elite Russian military intelligence unit has participated in virtually every military conflict in which Moscow has been embroiled in recent decades, including wars in Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Georgia.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, Ukraine's State Security Service alleges that Russian operatives are coordinating pro-Russian militias, helping them identify targets, and carrying out seizures of key installations, such as police and security headquarters, government offices, and communications infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian security officials say Russian intelligence has spent years building up a network of sleeper agents in eastern Ukraine. One of them, they say, is Igor Bezler, a 49-year-old Crimean native who they claim served in the GRU until 2002, when he moved to the eastern city of Horlivka. There, he worked as a security guard and as head of a funeral company. Last week, after a pro-Russian mob took over the town's police station, a video posted on a local news organization's website showed him parading in fatigues in front of a couple of dozen local police, identifying himself as a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army and telling them they had a new chief. Ukrainian officials allege he was tasked earlier this month with seizing state-security buildings in the Donetsk region, then taking the police station in Horlivka.\n\nThe separatists' endgame is unclear. Some talk of federalization within Ukraine; others want independence; yet others dream of a Crimea scenario, energized by Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent mention of Novorossiya (literally, New Russia), a tsarist-era imperial term for what is now southeastern Ukraine. Moscow's goals have also been unclear in comparison to the Crimea campaign, in which Moscow rapidly annexed the peninsula.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Face Challenges in Highlighting Policy Issues Amidst Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has dominated the political landscape, with the Democratic presidential candidates facing challenges in drawing attention to their key policy issues. The impeachment inquiry, initiated over allegations that Trump sought foreign help to smear a political rival, is expected to overshadow the Democratic primary race.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment effort, accusing Trump of seeking foreign help to damage Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden. The impeachment inquiry ensures a partisan fight in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail in the coming months.\n\nTrump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine. The impeachment inquiry is likely to energize both the Democratic base and Trump's base, as demonstrated by the Democratic party's fundraising efforts and Trump's re-election campaign's immediate fundraising success following Pelosi's announcement.\n\nKurt Meyer, Democratic party chairman for three rural Iowa counties north of Des Moines, stated that he expects the impeachment proceedings to energize the Democratic base. \"If a highly motivated person drags her mother and her husband and her second cousin twice removed to the polls, then it makes a difference,\" Meyer said.\n\nHowever, the impeachment inquiry could also drown out substantive policy discussions among the 19 Democrats running for the party's nomination. \"Trump has been the elephant in the room, but the democratic debates so far have been really policy-centered. I think impeachment now takes center stage,\" said Erin O' Brien, associate professor of political science at University of Massachusetts, Boston.\n\nBiden, who leads polls in the Democratic race, said on Tuesday he would back impeachment if the Republican president fails to comply with congressional requests for information on Ukraine and other matters. Biden leads Trump by about 5 percentage points in a hypothetical general election match-up, according to the Sept. 23-24 \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is likely to benefit Biden's Democratic rivals, including U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris. However, most have so far refused to be drawn into specific questions about Biden and his family, and are likely to stay that way for now.\n\nDemocrats should act swiftly to convince voters their actions are necessary and prevent Trump from successfully arguing he is being unfairly prosecuted, said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist who advised Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The impeachment inquiry's impact on the 2020 election remains to be seen, but it is clear that the political landscape has shifted, and the focus on policy issues may be temporarily eclipsed.",
    " Title: Rep. Justin Amash Resigns from House Freedom Caucus, Leaves Mark on Congressional History\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a four-term congressman and self-proclaimed \"defender of liberty and the Constitution,\" resigned from the House Freedom Caucus on Monday evening. The conservative group of Republican lawmakers, which Amash co-founded in 2015, has been a significant force in Congress, known for its role in pushing out former House Speaker John Boehner in October 2015.\n\nAmash's departure from the Freedom Caucus had been anticipated for some time. The caucus formally condemned him on May 20 after he called for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, alleging the president had committed \"impeachable conduct\" during the investigation led by former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAmash, who was part of the wave of tea party Republican lawmakers elected in 2010, co-founded the House Freedom Caucus with nine other freshman Republicans. The group's membership list is not public, but Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) currently serves as its chairman.\n\nThroughout his tenure in Congress, Amash has been known for his outspoken libertarian views and his transparency, often explaining almost every vote he took, from substantive votes on tax reform to symbolic votes on the naming of post offices.\n\nAmash made headlines in mid-May when he became the first Republican member of Congress to call for Trump's impeachment. In a series of tweets, Amash argued that Trump had obstructed justice during the Mueller investigation. Trump responded with criticism, but Amash has maintained his stance on impeachment.\n\nAmash is also known for his unbroken voting streak in Congress, taking 4,289 consecutive votes before missing one in March 2017 due to a scheduling mishap. The missed vote led him to cry, an event that is not typical in Congress.\n\nThere has been speculation about Amash running for president in 2020, either as a libertarian candidate or to challenge Trump in the Republican primary. Columnist Matt Lewis of The Daily Beast wrote on May 29 that it was time to draft Amash for president. Amash has not ruled out the possibility.\n\nAmash's resignation from the House Freedom Caucus was confirmed by his spokesperson, Poppy Nelson, to \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday morning. In a statement to CNN's Haley Byrd, who first reported the departure, Amash said, \"I have the highest regard for them, and they're my close friends. I didn't want to be a further distraction for the group.\" The exact reasons for Amash's resignation remain unclear.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Congress to Fund Two Years of Free Community College for All Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at Lake Area Technical Institute's commencement ceremony in Watertown, South Dakota on Friday, President Barack Obama called on Congress to close tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires and use the savings to offer all Americans a chance at two years of free community college. The President stated that this initiative is in \"everyone's interest\" as community colleges will play an increasingly vital role in the 21st-century economy.\n\nPresident Obama has proposed a plan for two years of free community college for everyone, but the plan remains stalled on Capitol Hill. During his address to the graduating class, he expressed his admiration for the graduates, stating, \"I didn't come here to inspire you. I came here because you, the graduates, inspire me.\" He further emphasized that the graduates had chosen to invest in themselves despite living through some of the toughest economic times in the country's history.\n\nThe President has spoken at numerous graduation ceremonies during his time in office, including those at Notre Dame, Northwestern University, West Point, and others. He chose to visit the small South Dakota technical school this year to underscore his belief that every American deserves at least some higher education, whether it comes at a major university or a small community college.\n\n\"Our budgets should reflect that we care about you, and that means giving everybody in America the chance you've had here,\" he said. \"I want to lower the cost of community college to zero... We can't afford to let striving Americans be priced out of the education they need to get ahead.\"\n\nThe President's proposal for free community college is part of a broader effort to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. The specifics of the plan, including how the tax loopholes would be closed and how the savings would be allocated, have not been detailed.",
    " Title: WikiLeaks Clarifies: Edward Snowden Has Not Accepted Asylum in Venezuela\n\nArticle:\n\nWikiLeaks, the organization that has been providing logistical support to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, has issued a statement clarifying that Snowden has not yet formally accepted asylum in Venezuela. The statement comes after a brief and tantalizing tip from Russian lawmaker Alexei Pushkov, who suggested that Snowden had decided to go to Venezuela.\n\nIn a tweet, WikiLeaks responded to Pushkov's earlier tweet, which was quickly deleted. Pushkov had referenced a report by the Russian TV news program Vesti 24, but later followed his deletion with a second tweet advising readers to contact the news program for more information.\n\nLater on Tuesday, WikiLeaks issued a cryptic tweet stating that the first phase of Snowden's \"Flight of Liberty\" campaign would be launched on Wednesday, with further details to follow. WikiLeaks, a website that has compiled an archive of classified files on the inner-workings of some governments, has spoken on behalf of Snowden several times regarding the issue of political asylum.\n\nThe confusion apparently stemmed from remarks by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has already offered asylum to Snowden. Maduro, speaking late Monday at a meeting with Panama's president, described the potential asylum for Snowden as the \"world's first collective humanitarian asylum\" with various countries saying \"Come here!\"\n\nMaduro stated that Snowden \"will have to decide when he flies here, if he finally wants to travel here.\" His remarks were distributed Tuesday by his office, according to the Associated Press.\n\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said Saturday that his country had not yet been in contact with Snowden, who has been unable to travel further due to the U.S. annulling his passport. For Snowden to leave for South America, he would need for Venezuela to issue him travel documents and find a way to get there. The only direct commercial flight from Moscow stops in Havana, Cuba.\n\nThe Moscow-Havana flight goes over Europe and the U.S., which could cause complications. Some European countries refused to allow Bolivian President Evo Morales to fly through their airspace on his way home from Moscow last week due to suspicions that Snowden was on his plane.\n\nThe presidents of Bolivia and Nicaragua also said over the weekend that Snowden was welcome in their countries. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that Russia has not notified the United States about any Snowden departure, and it appears that Tuesday's flap was due to an errant tweet.\n\nCarney stated that the administration wants Snowden to return to the United States, \"where he is wanted on felony charges,\" and that message has been communicated to Russia and other nations that might be willing to receive Snowden. The Obama administration sent an extradition request to Iceland's foreign ministry last week, according to WikiLeaks, citing an Icelandic news report. Iceland, where WikiLeaks has operated, is among about 30 countries Snowden has applied to for asylum. A WikiLeaks spokesman said the preemptive move highlighted the \"unprecedented severity\" and \"pressure and intimidation\" that the United States has placed on \"friendly countries\" in the Snowden case.",
    " Title: California Imposes Tougher COVID-19 Restrictions on Businesses in Response to Surge in Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has imposed stricter restrictions on businesses in response to a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday, Newsom ordered the closure of indoor non-essential businesses in 19 counties across the state, including Los Angeles County and Orange County.\n\nThe new restrictions affect bars, dine-in restaurants, indoor movie theaters, and indoor tasting rooms at wineries. Restaurants may remain open for takeout meals. The restrictions will remain in place for at least three weeks, Newsom said.\n\n\"I deeply respect people's liberty, their desire to go back to the way things were, but I can not impress upon you more, our actions have an impact on other people,\" Newsom said.\n\nNewsom recommended that fireworks shows be cancelled, and said parking lots at state beaches in Southern California and the Bay Area will be closed this weekend to limit crowds. The announcement comes just ahead of the July 4 weekend, when Newsom expressed concern about people in coronavirus hot spots ignoring public health guidelines and making the situation worse.\n\nCalifornia reported 110 deaths on Wednesday, the most the state has recorded since April, and nearly 6,000 new cases, Newsom said. Hospitalizations have jumped 51 percent in the past two weeks, and ICU admissions are up 47 percent over the same period.\n\n\"Please disabuse yourself that somehow, people are no longer dying,\" Newsom said. \"Please do not take your guard down, please do not believe those that somehow want to manipulate the reality that is demonstrable in those lives lost and those families that have been torn apart because of COVID-19.\"\n\nNewsom allowed local governments to begin reopening in early May. The most recent reopening phase took effect in mid-June and allowed retail stores, bars, dine-in restaurants, gyms, and hair and nail salons to reopen with certain occupancy restrictions.\n\nNewsom said the new closures are being targeted at trouble spots, rather than being imposed statewide. \"We're focusing and targeting local parts of the state where we're seeing an increase in community spread and we're seeing an increase in the positivity rate,\" Newsom said Wednesday. \"Not every part of the state is impacted equally, and as a consequence, we are not targeting on a statewide level these rules and regulations, we are focusing in on areas of concern.\"\n\nCalifornia's restrictions come as an increasing number of states have been backtracking their reopenings as coronavirus cases and hospitalization spike just ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend. States like Arizona, Georgia, Texas, and Ohio all reported record numbers of cases on Wednesday. Some records have been broken on a near-daily basis, while others were set at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring.\n\nGeorgia recorded nearly 3,000 new cases on Wednesday, breaking the previous single-day record of 2,225 cases, which was recorded on Sunday. The state has also been increasing testing, and the cumulative positivity rate is currently 9 percent.\n\nIn Ohio, the state reported 1,076 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, the first time daily reported coronavirus cases have exceeded 1,000 since April.\n\nTexas again broke its own daily record for new cases, reporting 8,076 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday.\n\nArizona on Wednesday also continued to break records, with nearly 5,000 new daily cases reported. Even more concerning, the death rates have also been increasing. Deaths are a lagging indicator, and officials have been citing a low death rate as a way to diminish the impact the virus has had.\n\nNationally, more than 48,000 new coronavirus cases were reported in the United States on Tuesday, according to data collected by the New York Times.",
    " Title: Gallup Poll: Trump and Obama Tied as Most Admired Man in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new Gallup poll, former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump are tied for the title of the most admired man in America. This marks Trump's first time earning the distinction, while Obama has been named the most admired man 12 times.\n\nThe poll, which has been conducted annually since 1948, asked Americans to name the man and woman living anywhere in the world they admire most. Of the people surveyed between Dec. 2 and 15, 18% named both Obama and Trump. The results were predictably split along party lines, with 41% of Democrats naming Obama and 45% of Republicans choosing Trump.\n\nAfter the two presidents, no other man was mentioned by more than 2% of respondents. The top 10 men this year also included President Jimmy Carter, businessman Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Pope Francis, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Dalai Lama, and Warren Buffet.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Michelle Obama was named the most admired woman in America. According to Gallup, the sitting president is typically Americans' choice for most admired man, taking the honor in 58 of the 72 prior polls.\n\nGallup noted in a press release that Trump's job approval rating is currently at 45%, among his best as president. The results come despite Trump becoming the third president in history to be impeached by Congress earlier this month. Coincident with the rise in his job approval rating, the 18% of Americans currently naming Trump as the most admired man is also up, from 13% in 2018 and 14% in 2017.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump was voted the second-most admired woman in the world, followed by Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton, and climate change activist Greta Thunberg tied for third place. The remainder of the top 10 women included Queen Elizabeth II, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.",
    " Title: Tea Party Activists Announce Primary Challenges Against Established GOP Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nMississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel announced on Thursday his intention to challenge U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran in the Republican primary next year. The announcement came a day after Cochran voted to end the 16-day government shutdown and grant President Obama more borrowing authority.\n\nMcDaniel's announcement was met with immediate support from outside groups that had rallied against this week's debt and spending agreement. Daniel Horowitz, deputy political director of the Madison Project, stated, \"Our country can't afford any more bad votes that stem from old friends and back-room deals. And as witnessed from the recent budget battle against Obamacare, we can't win against Democrats if we don't grow our conservative bench in the Senate.\"\n\nThe past two weeks have seen deep divisions within the GOP on public display. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, and their allies pushed to withhold all government spending unless President Obama agreed to cancel Obamacare, while party leaders called that a losing strategy and tried to come up with alternatives.\n\nOn Thursday, the GOP accepted defeat, passing a bill that gives President Obama a \"clean\" bill to reopen government through January, and to raise the debt through at least February. A majority of Republicans supported the deal in the Senate, but the situation was reversed in the House, where Cruz allies refused to sign off on a series of plans put forward by GOP leaders to end the stalemate.\n\nAhead of the vote, each side blamed the other for squandering leverage. President Obama, Democratic leaders, and even many top Republicans said they hoped the tea party side had learned some political and tactical lessons, particularly in fighting a fight that now appears to have been futile from the start.\n\nHowever, tea party lawmakers say they could have won if all Republicans had stuck together, and the lesson they draw is that they need to oust those who surrendered. Sen. Cruz's battle cry seemed to resonate Thursday across the country with a new generation of tea-party-style candidates who have announced bids to run against veteran GOP lawmakers in 2014.\n\nIn South Carolina, Nancy Mace, the first female graduate of The Citadel, lampooned GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham for being the sole Republican in the state's congressional delegation to support the debt deal. Another Graham opponent, state Sen. Lee Bright, also blasted the deal: \"We didn't get anything... We surrendered again.\"\n\nIn Tennessee, state Rep. Joe Carr accused Sen. Lamar Alexander of violating conservative principles by voting to raise the debt ceiling without any accompanying spending cuts. And in Louisville, Ky., Matt Bevin, a wealthy businessman running against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, praised Sen. Cruz as the new face of the conservative movement and blasted McConnell, who wrote the final debt deal with his Democratic counterpart, Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\n\"This shutdown was completely avoidable if we had real leadership in Washington,\" Mr. Bevin said in a Web video. \"Instead, we have career politicians like Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid that make decisions based on what is political expediency for them, not on principles and not on what is in the best interest of the American people.\"\n\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the party's 2008 vice president candidate, also weighed in, urging her supporters via Facebook not to \"be discouraged by the shenanigans of D.C.'s permanent political class today.\"\n\n\"We're going to shake things up in 2014,\" Mrs. Palin said. \"Rest well tonight, for soon we must focus on important House and Senate races. Let's start with Kentucky\u2014which happens to be awfully close to South Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi\u2014from sea to shining sea we will not give up. We've only just begun to fight.\"\n\nThe tea party, though, could face an uphill battle in the 2014 campaign season. A new Pew Research Center poll found the popularity of the tea party\u2014including within Republican ranks\u2014has plummeted in recent months and even more so since 2010 when it helped the GOP take over the House. Now 49 percent of the public has an unfavorable view of the tea party, compared to 30 percent who hold a favorable view.\n\nJim Manley, a Democratic strategist, said that the budget stalemate may have weakened the tea party within Congress, though it hasn't been eliminated. \"What's interesting is that more and more senators have had it with the antics of Sens. Cruz and Lee,\" Mr. Manley said. \"The 'just say no' crowd is down to only 18 in the Senate Republican caucus, a tremendous change from only a few months ago.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Considering Increased Aid for European Migrant Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is actively exploring ways to offer additional assistance to Europe as thousands of Syrian refugees and other migrants continue to arrive daily, reaching safe havens in countries like Germany. The migrant crisis has put a strain on infrastructure in Greece, Macedonia, and Hungary, and has highlighted divisions among European Union (EU) countries.\n\nGermany's vice-chancellor suggested on Tuesday that his country could accept at least 500,000 migrants annually, but also called for other EU countries to contribute more. In Hungary, where thousands of migrants were trapped in large camps before neighboring borders were opened, the prime minister is urging the completion of a 13-foot fence at its border with Serbia before the end of this year.\n\nAccording to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, Hungary claims that the migrants are primarily fleeing economic hardship and do not require asylum status to protect their lives. Hungarian authorities are reportedly hindering migrants in their journey through southeast Europe towards the West. Romania has stated that migrant quotas are not the solution, while the EU maintains that countries must work together in solidarity to address the crisis.\n\nOn Monday, both France and Britain pledged to accept thousands of migrants, with France committing to take in 24,000 and Britain committing to accept 20,000. However, these numbers are significantly lower than the pace set by Germany, which welcomed at least 20,000 migrants over the past weekend. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also announced that Germany is dedicating $6.7 billion to manage the crisis.\n\nRegarding potential U.S. involvement, the White House stated that it is examining a range of approaches to be more responsive to the global refugee crisis, including with regard to refugee resettlement. The administration added that the U.S. has provided over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance since the Syrian crisis began and over $1 billion in assistance this year, making it the single largest donor to the Syrian crisis.\n\nAs of 2015, more than 367,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to seek safety and better prospects in Europe, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. Of that number, over 244,000 landed in Greece, and at least 121,000 reached Italy. The U.N. agency reported a sharp increase in the number of migrants in August, with nearly 130,000 migrants arriving.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Economic Policy Narrative: A Comparison to Bill Clinton's Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her bid for the presidency, Hillary Clinton is positioning her economic policy as a continuation of her husband's administration, emphasizing the economic struggles of the American middle class. This strategy contrasts with the Republican narrative that a vote for Clinton is a vote for a third term of Barack Obama's presidency.\n\nClinton's campaign has been focusing on economic issues such as inequality of opportunity, less mobility, and the gender pay gap. In comments made over the past year, she has portrayed the 1990s as a model for sound economic policies, even when compared with the record of Ronald Reagan, the modern-day Republican Party hero.\n\nIn June 2020, Clinton told PBS, \"If you want a better future that is going to be reliant on making smart economic policies, compare my husband\u2019s eight years with Ronald Reagan\u2019s eight years\u201423 million new jobs, more than seven million people lifted out of poverty.\" In another speech last year, she declared, \"The 1990s taught us that even in the face of difficult long-term economic trends, it\u2019s possible through smart policies and sound investments to enjoy broad-based growth and shared prosperity.\"\n\nThe eight years following her husband's presidency, according to Clinton, showed the consequences of bad policy, turning budget surpluses into deficits and \"what happens when your only policy prescription is to cut taxes for the wealthy.\"\n\nThe economic conditions during Clinton's campaign in the early 1990s, marked by massive layoffs in manufacturing during the recession of 1991, are arguably better today, with the unemployment rate averaging 6.8 percent in 1991 and 7.5 percent in 1992, compared to 5.5 percent over the past months. However, the national mood is arguably worse, with jobs numbers not adequately accounting for the lower participation rate of American workers, with a smaller percentage of Americans working (nearly 67 percent then versus about 62 percent now). Moreover, wages have barely increased for the vast majority of workers since the early 1990s.\n\nIn contrast to the early Republican message that government has impeded the progress of the average American, the Clinton campaign looks to stress how government, in conjunction with individual initiatives and businesses, can help boost opportunities. The implication is that this is what happened throughout the eight years the other Clinton was president.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2000, the United States experienced a boom in both employment and economic growth. Gallup polls showed a significant improvement in sentiment about the economy, with just 24 percent expressing satisfaction in 1992 compared with 69 percent in 2000. The prevailing buzz was of an economy firing on all cylinders, boosted by information technologies that were enhancing worker productivity and by a Wall Street and equity boom that saw tens of millions of Americans trading hot-dot stocks that promised not just wealth but connectivity, peace, and happiness.",
    " Title: GOP Plans to Pursue Phase Two of Tax Reform Ahead of Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted just a few months ago, has prompted Republicans to consider phase two of tax reform, with the 2018 midterm elections in mind. The strategy aims to garner more voter support by making permanent the individual tax cuts, potentially forcing Democrats into difficult votes.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, \"We hope to get support from our Democrat friends. In fact, one of the pushbacks we heard from the Democrats was if these tax cuts are so good, why didn't we make them permanent? We've got no problem with that.\"\n\nUnder the current law, individual tax cuts are set to expire in ten years. Republicans were compelled to make them temporary due to budget rules and the lack of Democrat support during the bill's passage. Now, the GOP sees an opportunity to make them permanent before the midterm elections, with the potential consequence of putting Democrats on record against the cuts if they fail to provide the necessary votes.\n\nWalker stated, \"I don't know if you would call it support, but at least acknowledgment from some of our Democratic colleagues that tax reform is working in many parts of our country.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers have signaled they might release parts of phase two of the tax plan on April 15. Walker, a former pastor, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News that this second phase will likely consist of smaller adjustment bills. One of these bills, according to Walker, is the Universal Charitable Giving Act, which would allow families and non-itemizers to deduct charitable donations.\n\nWalker explained that this bill ensures the new tax plan will not negatively affect donations to churches and non-profits. \"We want to make sure that those gifts are protected,\" the North Carolina lawmaker said.\n\nHowever, Walker does not expect another attempt at repealing the Johnson Amendment through tax reform. He stated, \"We believe and hear that it is picking up some energy. At some point, we would like to attach it to something this year.\"\n\nLawmakers believe they could begin voting on parts of phase two as early as this month.",
    " Title: Mueller Threatens to Subpoena Trump as Part of Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly warned that he could order President Donald Trump to testify as part of an investigation into alleged Russian election meddling. This is believed to be the first time the special counsel has raised the possibility of issuing a subpoena.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Mr. Trump's lawyers were informed during a meeting in March that Mueller's team would consider issuing a subpoena if the president declined to testify. The president's former lawyer, John Dowd, has also confirmed this information.\n\nThe potential questions for Trump cover his motivations in dismissing former FBI director James Comey last May and his campaign's contacts with Russia. The president has repeatedly denied collusion, and Russia has also denied the allegations.\n\nTy Cobb, who has been Mr. Trump's main legal representative in the probe, is stepping down. The White House stated that Cobb had been considering retirement for some time and decided to leave at the end of this month.\n\nThe special counsel is investigating Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election, whether there was any collusion between the Kremlin and Trump's election campaign, and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry. Mueller was appointed special counsel following Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey last May.\n\nIt remains unclear when Mueller will request a meeting with the president. The special counsel's office has remained tight-lipped, but the evolving strategies of the president's legal team are playing out nearly in full view. The US president himself has said he is willing to speak to Mueller, but his enthusiasm has reportedly cooled after the offices of his personal attorney were raided.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Unveil Police Reform Legislation: The Justice Act\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans have introduced their police reform legislation, titled the Justice Act, which aims to hold officers accountable through an enhanced use-of-force database, restrictions on chokeholds, and the creation of new commissions to study law enforcement and race. The bill was spearheaded by Sen. Tim Scott, the lone African-American GOP senator, in response to the death of George Floyd and nationwide protests for racial justice.\n\nSen. Scott framed the legislation as a bridge between law enforcement and communities of color, stating, \"The answer to the question of which side do you support is 'I support America.' If you support America, you support restoring the confidence that communities of color have in institutions of authority.\"\n\nThe 106-page legislation, called the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere (JUSTICE) Act, was unveiled by Sen. Scott, along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, James Lankford, and Ben Sasse.\n\nThe bill does not ban chokeholds outright and does not end qualified immunity, which has been criticized by Democrats as not going far enough. Senate Democrats have already unveiled their police reform legislation, the Justice in Policing Act, which includes measures to lower the bar for police officers to face criminal prosecution and create a national database of cops who have committed misconduct.\n\nThe GOP legislation would beef up requirements for law enforcement to compile use-of-force reports under a new George Floyd and Walter Scott Notification Act, named for the Minnesota father whose death sparked worldwide protests over police violence, and Scott, the South Carolina man shot by police after a traffic stop in 2015, no relation to the senator. It would also establish the Breonna Taylor Notification Act to track \"no-knock\" warrants.\n\nThe bill encourages agencies to do away with chokeholds or risk losing federal funds and provides funding for training to \"de-escalate\" situations and establish a \"duty to intervene\" protocol to prevent excessive force. The Republican package also includes a bipartisan Senate proposal to establish a National Criminal Justice Commission Act and extends funding streams for various federal law enforcement programs, including the COPS program important to states.\n\nThe GOP effort seeks to reach across the aisle to Democrats in several ways, including making lynching a federal hate crime and launching a study of the social status of black men and boys. The Republican package also includes a proposal to close a loophole to prohibit federal law enforcement officers from engaging in sexual acts with those being arrested or in custody. The bill also includes tapping the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture to create a law enforcement training curriculum on \"the history of racism in the United States.\"",
    " Title: Former DNC Chair Howard Dean Withdraws, Leaving Rep. Keith Ellison as Frontrunner Amid Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vermont Governor Howard Dean has withdrawn from the race to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC), citing time constraints as the reason for his exit. His departure leaves Minnesota Representative Keith Ellison as the frontrunner for the position, but he is currently facing criticism regarding his ability to perform the job while remaining in the House of Representatives.\n\nAt a meeting of DNC chair candidates in Denver on Friday, Ellison stated, \"I am in the process of deciding this issue of whether I can perform both roles. It has become very apparent that many of you feel very strongly about this. I've loved being in Congress...but I do think that it is more important to build and strengthen the DNC.\"\n\nHistorically, elected officials have chaired the DNC, but some Democrats, including those within the Obama administration, have expressed concerns that leading the party against Donald Trump will be a full-time job. Ellison's position as the first Muslim elected to Congress gives him a symbolically powerful stance against Trump, but his past comments critical of US foreign policy regarding Israel may have weakened his prospects for the DNC post.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League recently raised concerns about Ellison's ability to represent the Democratic Party's traditional support for a strong and secure Israel, citing editorials written by Ellison for his college newspaper. In response, Ellison issued an open letter on Thursday, stating his commitment to Israel's safety and security and his support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nEllison was an early favorite for the DNC job, earning endorsements from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both of whom support a more populist position for the Democratic Party. This made Ellison a natural choice over Dean, who has served as DNC chair before and was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton.\n\nWith Dean's departure, Ellison now faces two remaining opponents: South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley. Both candidates agree that the future of the DNC should focus on rebuilding state parties after numerous congressional and gubernatorial losses in the November elections.\n\n\"We must become a community organization, working in our neighborhoods with grassroots activists,\" said Mr. Harrison. Mr. Buckley suggested an alternative leadership strategy, with him handling the nuts and bolts of running the party while Ellison or Harrison serves as the public face of the party. Dean had also called for a new leadership strategy, the \"50 state strategy\" he championed as chairman in 2004 through 2008.\n\nWhile Dean's approach proved popular among state party chairs, it did not resonate with younger Democrats, a key constituency at a time when many party officials say that the DNC needs a younger face and new approach to survive going forward. Dean warned against letting the DNC chair race reopen the ideological party divisions exposed in the primaries.\n\n\"We can not let this be a proxy fight between Bernie Sanders supporters and Hillary Clinton supporters,\" Dean, who was a strong Clinton backer, said in a video message announcing his withdrawal. \"We have to get rid of this idea that there is a Bernie Democrat or a Hillary Democrat or an Obama Democrat.\"\n\nThe DNC chair will be decided in February, when more than 400 members of the DNC meet to vote on who will lead the party during Trump's presidency.",
    " Title: Pentagon Shifts $3.8 Billion for Border Wall Construction, Sparking Congressional Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced a reallocation of $3.8 billion from weapons programs to fund the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, a move that has upset lawmakers who argue the White House is bypassing their authority.\n\nIn a notice delivered to Congress on Thursday, the Pentagon revealed it is transferring $2.2 billion from its base fiscal 2020 budget and $1.6 billion from the Overseas Contingency Operations war fund. These funds will be moved to the Department of Defense's counter-drug fund, which will then be utilized for border wall construction.\n\nAccording to The Hill, the Department of Homeland Security has identified areas along the southern border as drug smuggling corridors, and has deemed the construction of additional physical barriers and roads necessary to impede drug smuggling activities.\n\nThis is not the first time the administration has used executive authority to shift federal funds to the wall, largely due to Democratic lawmakers' opposition to immigration enforcement funding. Thursday's announcement has already drawn criticism from lawmakers who demand the White House seek congressional approval first.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who serves as the House Appropriations Committee chairwoman, and Democratic Rep. Pete Visclosky of Indiana, the chairman of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, issued a joint statement, stating, \"While some of our Republican colleagues will lament the President\u2019s decision, they enabled this theft by blocking our efforts to stop the President from raiding defense accounts.\"\n\nDemocratic criticism was expected, but one top Republican lawmaker also voiced disapproval of the administration's move on Thursday.\n\n\"The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress\u2019s constitutional authority, and I believe that it requires Congress to take action,\" Texas GOP Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. Thornberry added that he would be in touch with his colleagues to determine \"the appropriate steps to take.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump first declared an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border in February 2019, allowing him to use executive authority to reallocate federal funds. Congress has twice attempted to rescind the president's emergency declaration, but was unable to overturn his vetoes both times.\n\nThe Trump administration has set an ambitious goal of completing 450 border wall miles by the end of 2020, addressing a campaign promise ahead of the November presidential elections. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced in a document obtained by the \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation that the administration built 119 miles of new border wall as of Feb. 7, in places where dilapidated walls existed or where no walls previously existed at all.",
    " Title: Senate Allegations Against Judge Kavanaugh Shift Focus Amidst Confirmation Process\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh has seen a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the allegations against him. Initially, the Democrats were vocal in their opposition, labeling Judge Kavanaugh as a potential rapist and liar. However, after weeks of hearings and an additional FBI investigation, the Democratic allegations have changed focus.\n\nOn July 9, the day President Donald Trump announced Judge Kavanaugh as his choice for the court, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer announced his intention to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination. Breitbart reported that Schumer stated, \"I will oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything I have because the stakes are simply too high.\"\n\nIn the following weeks, the Democrats' tactics shifted from accusing Judge Kavanaugh of being a serial rapist to questioning his temperament and behavior during his college years. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a key figure in the confirmation process, criticized Judge Kavanaugh's testimony as \"aggressive and belligerent.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported a new allegation against Judge Kavanaugh, claiming he once threw ice at a bar during college. The incident, which occurred in September 1985, resulted in Kavanaugh and four other men being questioned by the New Haven Police Department. Kavanaugh was not arrested, but a 21-year-old man accused Kavanaugh of throwing ice on him \"for some unknown reason.\"\n\nThe shift in allegations against Judge Kavanaugh has raised questions about the truth and credibility of the initial accusations made by the Democrats. The confirmation process has exposed the tactics used by some politicians and the media to discredit and assassinate the character of an individual for political gain.\n\nAs the confirmation process continues, it is essential to remain informed and vigilant, as the actions of the Senate and the media have far-reaching implications for the future of the American judicial system and the lives of its citizens.",
    " Title: Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates Warns of Credibility Problems for Both Presidential Candidates in Foreign Affairs\n\n Article:\n\n In a recent op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has expressed concerns about the foreign affairs credibility of both presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\n Gates, who has served eight U.S. presidents over 50 years, criticized Clinton for her role in advocating for the use of U.S. military to bring about regime change in Libya and her failure to anticipate the ensuing chaos. He also compared her handling of the post-Saddam Iraq situation to the criticism Democrats levied against the Bush 43 administration.\n\n Regarding Trump, Gates stated that the Republican candidate has a significant credibility problem. He cited Trump's proposals such as building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, supporting torture of suspected terrorists, and praising Vladimir Putin's dictatorial leadership and Saddam Hussein's nonexistent successes against terrorism.\n\n Gates evaluated the candidates' positions on various global national security issues, including China, North Korea, Iran, Russia, and international trade. He warned that the new president will likely face an early test of U.S. resolve in the Persian Gulf and Iran's continued regional subversion.\n\n Although Gates has concerns with both candidates, he believes Clinton fares slightly better than Trump. He urged Clinton to address her trustworthiness, demonstrate her judgment, and provide specific details about her plans for dealing with various global issues.\n\n Gates, however, deemed Trump \"beyond repair\" on national security issues, stating that Trump is uninformed about the world, lacks the temperament to lead the country and government, and is unsuited to lead U.S. military personnel.\n\n The extent to which Clinton addresses these issues, according to Gates, will impact voter decisions, including his own. However, he considers Trump's national security positions as irreparable.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania Resident Fined for Driving During Stay-at-Home Order\n\nArticle:\n\nAnita Shaffer, a resident of Pennsylvania, was issued a $200 fine for violating the state's stay-at-home order aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. According to Shaffer, she went for a leisurely drive on Sunday to get out of the house, but was pulled over by two state police officers as she returned home due to a faulty taillight. The ticket issued to Shaffer states that she violated the state's Disease Control and Prevention Act of 1955 and \"failed to abide by the order of the governor and secretary of health issued to control the spread of a communicable disease.\"\n\nShaffer told PennLive's Jan Murphy that the officers asked her if she was aware of the stay-at-home act. \"I am aware of it, but I didn't know it pertained to just driving,\" Shaffer said.\n\nThe encounter between Shaffer and the police has sparked debate over the enforcement of stay-at-home orders and the balance between public health and civil liberties. Ryan Tarkowski, a spokesman for the state police, explained the encounter as an opportunity for officers to reinforce the necessity of abiding by stay-at-home orders. However, some argue that a single person driving in their own car does not pose a significant risk of spreading the coronavirus.\n\nThe incident is not an isolated one. In California, a paddleboarder was arrested last week for violating the state's stay-at-home order, and in New York City, where the COVID-19 outbreak is most severe, police have been arresting people for violating social distancing orders.\n\nThe economic impact of stay-at-home orders and mandatory shutdowns has been a topic of discussion, with concerns about the immense economic damage and widespread unemployment. The question of how aggressively shutdown orders should be policed has also been raised, with concerns about the potential for increased risk of spreading disease through aggressive enforcement.\n\nElizabeth Goitein, director for liberty and national security at the Brennan Center for Justice, a legal policy think tank, suggests that policies should be driven by science, proportionate to the risks involved, and not last any longer than necessary. Goitein worries that ramped-up scrutiny of everyday life could become a new normal that tilts away from freedom.\n\nPolice should not have the power to stop and question everyone who leaves their home in apparent contravention of a stay-at-home order. Enforcement should be focused on preventing large public gatherings and actual violations of social distancing guidelines, rather than targeting individuals who are not posing a risk to others.\n\nShaffer plans to appeal the ticket and fine. In an update, York County District Attorney Dave Sunday has announced his intention to withdraw the citation against Shaffer, stating that prosecution may not be in the public interest due to the specific circumstances of the case.",
    " Title: Former President Obama Criticizes U.S. Gun Laws Abroad, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama, while speaking at a tech conference in Brazil, criticized the lack of gun laws in the United States, particularly regarding the sale of what he referred to as \"machine guns.\" The speech, which was captured on video and later removed from YouTube, sparked controversy as Obama expressed his frustration over the ease of purchasing firearms in the U.S.\n\nDuring his speech, Obama referenced the Sandy Hook school shooting, stating that he was unable to assure parents that laws would change to prevent the easy purchase of machine guns. However, it is important to note that the Sandy Hook shooter was prevented from purchasing a weapon due to existing U.S. laws, and the shooter ultimately stole the weapons used in the tragedy from his own mother, whom he murdered first.\n\nAllahpundit, a writer for Hot Air, commented that it is unclear what specific regulations Obama is advocating for to prevent such scenarios, apart from a total ban and mass confiscation. Allahpundit also pointed out that Obama's portrayal of the U.S. as lawless was made in a country that has a notoriously high murder rate, approximately six times that of the United States.\n\nIt is essential to clarify that weapons are regulated in the United States, with numerous state and federal laws governing their purchase, sale, use, manufacture, and more. The intricate debates over gun laws within the U.S. may not translate well in countries with different systems, but this does not mean they do not exist.\n\nObama's comments were criticized for being inaccurate and potentially misleading, with some interpreting them as an attempt to criticize America to a foreign audience, a practice that was reportedly a specialty of Obama during his presidency.",
    " Title: Parallels Between HIV and Ebola Outbreaks: Researcher Reflects on History and Lessons Learned\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with journalist Julia Belluz, Rick Elion, the clinical-research director at the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington, D.C., discusses the parallels between the HIV and Ebola outbreaks and the lessons that have been missed in responding to disease outbreaks.\n\nElion, who has been a long-time HIV researcher, expressed that watching the public's reaction to Ebola today brings him feelings of post-traumatic stress disorder, reminding him of the early days of HIV/AIDS. He noted that, similar to HIV, there is a desire to isolate those suspected of carrying the virus, and fear-based policies are being enacted.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on the public's fear and discussion about Ebola, Elion stated, \"It's the same discussion: people want to wall off what they're afraid of.\" He went on to explain that with HIV, victims were seen with derision and were often blamed for their disease. With Ebola, the victims have been mostly occupational exposures, and the public is more sympathetic, but there is still a desire to isolate Ebola victims.\n\nElion also discussed the emotional impact of the Ebola epidemic, stating that it brings back memories of HIV and the large number of people who have died from the virus. He emphasized the need to bring humanity into the equation when responding to disease outbreaks, as the longer we do not, the more the disease will flourish.\n\nRegarding isolationist policies such as quarantines and travel bans, Elion stated that these were tried with HIV and did not work. He explained that borders are porous, and people can leave their country and fly another way. He suggested that it is better to keep the borders porous and regulate who is moving, rather than imposing quarantines.\n\nElion also noted that the quarantine policy is irrational and will impair the ability of help to flow to the affected population. He stated that quarantining afebrile people is counter-productive, as these individuals are not likely to be transmitting the virus.",
    " Title: Bluefin-21 Resumes Search for MH370 as Object of Interest Proven Not to Be Plane Debris\n\nArticle:\n\nThe autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 has resumed its mission to search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, after scanning over 90% of the designated search area. The search for an object found near Augusta, Australia, which was initially considered a potential lead, has been ruled out as debris from the missing plane.\n\nThe metal object, which appeared to have rivets on one side, was picked up near Augusta, approximately 1,000 miles away from the suspected crash site. However, detailed pictures of the object were enough to convince investigators that it was not a lead in the search for the missing plane. Authorities have not yet determined the object's origin.\n\nThe search for Flight 370, which carried 239 passengers and crew, has been ongoing for 48 days, with no signs of debris found. The search efforts have been complicated by the Indian Ocean being filled with garbage, with other objects spotted in the search turning out to be trash, jellyfish, and fishing gear.\n\nOn Thursday, up to 11 military aircraft and 11 ships are set to search for the plane. The Bluefin-21 has begun its 12th mission, continuing to scan the underwater search area set out by investigators.\n\nMalaysian and Australian authorities are already mapping out a long-term strategy for the search, which could last for months or years, if the two-year search for Air France Flight 447 is any guide. If the underwater search comes up empty, it could ground the air search as well.\n\nThe next logical step after the underwater search is to \"rethink all of the information we have at hand,\" ocean search specialist Rob McCallum told CNN. An expanded search area might include the last 370 miles of the plane's flight path, perhaps 15 miles on either side. Deep-towed sonar, which provides less resolution than the Bluefin-21 but about 10 times the range, may also be considered.\n\nInvestigators would love to find the flight data recorders from Flight 370, a potential treasure trove of information into what happened to the jetliner and the 239 passengers and crew on board. If found, the \"black boxes\" would likely go to the Australian Transport Safety Board's accident investigation lab. However, the investigation is officially Malaysian, so Malaysia's officials would decide where the boxes would go.\n\nThe Malaysian Cabinet has approved the appointment of an international investigation team to look into the disappearance of Flight 370. The names of the team members will be announced next week, and the team will not be looking at the criminal aspects of the investigation, which remain under the Royal Malaysian Police. The main purpose of the team is to evaluate and determine the cause of the accident. Malaysia has completed a preliminary report on the incident but has not released it publicly.",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Discuss Deficit Reduction Framework, Differences Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a meeting at the White House on Monday, President Obama and Speaker John Boehner discussed a deficit reduction framework that would raise $1 trillion over 10 years. The details of the plan will be settled next year by Congress's tax-writing committees and the Obama administration.\n\nIn response to the initial $1.6 trillion proposal, President Obama reduced his proposal to $1.2 trillion, with $1.22 trillion in spending cuts compared to the Republicans' initial offer of $1.2 trillion in cuts. The White House plan would permanently extend Bush-era tax cuts on household incomes below $400,000, with only the top tax bracket, currently 35 percent, increasing to 39.6 percent.\n\nThe White House plan would cut spending by $1.22 trillion over 10 years, with $800 billion in cuts to programs, $122 billion from adopting a new measure of inflation that slows the growth of government benefits, especially Social Security, and $290 billion in savings from lower interest costs on a reduced national debt.\n\nOf the $800 billion in straight cuts, the president said half would come from federal health care programs, $200 billion from other so-called mandatory programs like farm price supports, not subject to Congress's annual spending bills, $100 billion from military spending, and $100 billion from domestic programs under Congress's annual discretion.\n\nTo make the plan happen, President Obama proposed fast-track procedures to help Congressional tax writers overhaul the individual and corporate tax code and make changes to other programs.\n\nSenior Republican aides made it clear that differences remain between the two parties. For instance, they say the president is still pressing for $1.3 trillion in higher taxes because the change in the way inflation is calculated would not only slow the growth of spending but also raise more revenue by slowing the rate at which tax brackets rise each year with the cost of living.\n\nThey also disagree with the president over counting lower interest payments on the national debt as savings. \"A proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts can not be considered balanced,\" said another spokesman for Mr. Boehner, using the Republicans' calculation for the president's offer.\n\nThe president is also insisting on some protections for what he has called the \"most vulnerable populations,\" which Republican aides said they had not been expecting. The new inflation calculations, for instance, would probably not affect wounded veterans and disabled people on Supplemental Security Income.\n\nAdditionally, President Obama is sticking by his request for additional upfront spending on infrastructure and an extension of expiring unemployment benefits. He would also secure some tax and policy changes long sought by both parties but unattainable in the context of smaller budget deals.\n\nTo keep the country from returning to fiscal showdowns, Mr. Obama wants the government's borrowing limit to rise high enough to take the issue off the table for two years, although he said that Congress could periodically weigh in and try to override a presidential lifting of the debt ceiling, should it want to.\n\nSenior Republican aides made it clear on Monday night that the plan was not what the speaker had wanted. He had proposed higher income tax rates on income over $1 million. That revenue would be supplemented by reinstating a provision in the tax code\u2014phased out by the Bush-era tax cuts\u2014that automatically limits tax deductions and credits for the affluent. The speaker was also ready to accept a White House proposal from Mr. Obama's first days in office that would limit tax deductions to 28 percent, trimming back deductions for charitable giving and other activities from the top rate paid by the giver, 35 percent currently.",
    " Title: Central American Leaders and Obama Discuss Comprehensive Plan to Address Youth Migrant Surge\n\nArticle:\n\nCentral American leaders, including the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, met with President Barack Obama at the White House on Friday to discuss a comprehensive plan to address the surge of immigrant youth from their countries entering the United States illegally. The meeting was part of an effort to find a solution to the ongoing humanitarian crisis, which has become a contentious issue in the debate over reforming the U.S. immigration system.\n\nThe Central American leaders signaled to Obama that they are working on a plan to address the root causes of the migration, including strategies for reducing crime and promoting greater social and economic opportunity. The presidents reiterated their commitment to prevent families and children from undertaking the dangerous journey and to work together to promote safe, legal, and orderly migration.\n\nObama told the Central American leaders that most of the child migrants crossing the border illegally will not be permitted to stay. Some have been deported already, while most are being allowed to stay temporarily while their immigration status is sorted out. The Obama administration has also discussed a pilot program that would let the United States assess asylum claims in those countries to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.\n\nThe administration and Congress have struggled to come to a consensus on how to address the surge that has overwhelmed border and immigration services. Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds for border efforts, while Republicans and some Democrats in Congress are resisting that proposal and offering alternatives that would spend less and change immigration policy to deport kids faster.\n\nThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on a scaled-down border bill next week that would provide less than $1 billion to address the crisis and modify a 2008 law to make it easier to deport children from Central America who enter the United States illegally. The proposal to alter that law all but ensures the bill will not come to a vote in the Senate, where Democrats are opposed to tagging that change to a funding bill of its own for the border crisis.\n\nThe administration is also considering sending National Guard troops to the border, according to a White House official, just days after Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would do just that in the Rio Grande Valley area. The Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services sent a team this week to assess Border Patrol efforts in the Rio Grande Valley. The number of unaccompanied minors seeping through that area has slowed dramatically since last month.",
    " Title: Rep. Al Green Introduces Articles of Impeachment Against President Trump, Citing Disparaging Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Al Green (D-TX) has become the first member of Congress to publicly read articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on the House floor. The president's Twitter account is at the center of the allegations, with Trump's remarks about NFL players, Puerto Ricans, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and former President Barack Obama cited as examples of \"crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nGreen's proposal, however, is unlikely to gain traction, given the Republican control of both the House and Senate. Even some Democrats have expressed skepticism about the idea of impeaching Trump in the near future.\n\nIn a 15-page document, Green argues that Trump should be impeached for tweeting disparaging remarks about various groups. The document, which can be read in full below, does not mention Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey or the obstruction of justice allegations.\n\nGreen contends that the Constitution does not require the commission of a crime for a president to be impeached. Instead, he argues that \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" referred to in Article II, Section IV consist of actions that may be \"denominated political.\"\n\nAmong the \"high crimes\" Trump is accused of committing are falsely claiming President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, vowing to ban transgender people from the military, and calling NFL players \"sons of bitches.\"\n\nGreen has faced death threats and a barrage of hate mail since first proposing impeachment charges against Trump. Aides say they have received far more feedback over Green's impeachment speech alone than in the rest of this congressional term. Green was in contact with the FBI for his safety.\n\nMost Democrats say it is too early to advance calls for impeachment. In an interview this May, Green acknowledged that his articles of impeachment are unlikely to go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Congress. At the time, he argued that Trump should be impeached for obstructing justice by firing Comey, a charge that does not appear in his articles of impeachment.\n\nGreen wrote the document himself after consulting with constitutional scholars, he said. \"The Comey firing is something that is still subject to impeachment,\" Green said. \"But the last straw for me was when the president called the NFL men who played football'sons of Bs,'\" he added, referring to Trump's use of a racial slur against NFL players.",
    " Title: GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy Questions ABC News Over Alleged Spiking of Jeffrey Epstein Story\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has sent a letter to ABC News President James Goldston, posing a series of questions regarding the network's reported decision to withhold a story about the late Jeffrey Epstein, a financier who was accused of child trafficking and pedophilia. The letter, obtained exclusively by Megyn Kelly and shared on her Instagram account, lists six specific inquiries, taking an urgent tone due to the nature of the alleged human trafficking operation.\n\nThe questions include:\n1. Will ABC News provide Congress the interview conducted by Amy Robach, the journalist who reportedly had firsthand information from one of Epstein's accusers, with the victim?\n2. What did ABC News learn about Epstein after Robach first presented her story to executives?\n3. Who was involved in deciding this story was not of public interest, and what were their reasons for doing so?\n4. Can Robach expand on the \u201coutside forces\u201d she mentioned as potentially responsible for the story not running?\n5. Was ABC News ever presented with additional evidence on Epstein from the time Robach first brought her investigation to the network and when he was ultimately arrested?\n6. Were authorities alerted at any time after Robach presented ABC News executives with her reporting? If so, when and what was provided?\n\nIn a series of Project Veritas videos released earlier this month, former ABC News reporter Amy Robach spoke candidly about how the network refused to air her chilling report on Epstein a few years ago. Epstein, who reportedly committed suicide in prison a few months ago, has been accused of pimping young girls and forcing them to have sex with hundreds of men.\n\nMcCarthy expressed regret over the situation, stating, \"ABC News chose to bury the truth.\" In a separate development, Kelly interviewed former ABC News producer Ashley Bianco, who was fired by CBS for reportedly leaking the video clip of Robach criticizing ABC News for nixing her Epstein story. Bianco claimed she did not leak the video to Project Veritas, leaving open the question of whether CBS fired the wrong person. According to Project Veritas's James O'Keefe, the real leaker is still at ABC.\n\nABC News has denied reports that they killed Robach's story.",
    " Title: Congressional Agenda Dominated by Veto Threats as Obama and Democratic Leaders Stake Out Positions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 114th Congress, barely a week old, has seen the \"V-word\" take center stage as President Obama has issued veto threats on three measures, with Democratic leaders vowing to provide the necessary votes to uphold them. Despite calls for cooperation and Republican efforts to line up bipartisan bills for their early agenda, the President's veto threats have been met with resistance from both parties.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, stated on Thursday that her troops will vote to uphold the vetoes. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats launched their first filibuster of the year on the third day of business, a record-breaking move according to an analysis. The filibuster was on legislation to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which has bipartisan support.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, stated that they will work through the process to get bipartisan jobs legislation on the President's desk as soon as possible. President Obama has issued a veto threat on the Keystone measure, as well as a bill to repeal Obamacare's 30-hour workweek definition and legislation that includes a two-year delay of Dodd-Frank financial reform regulations.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat and Keystone supporter, stated on Thursday that he believes enough Democrats could rally behind the project for the Senate to override an Obama veto. However, Pelosi stated that she will muster Democrats in her chamber to uphold the veto on Keystone and the other two issues where President Obama has drawn lines.\n\nPelosi stated that the President's veto is the key to Democrats' legislative strategy this year. After years of blaming Republicans for blocking Democrats' agenda, Pelosi said that relying on the President to veto bills doesn't make Democrats the \"party of 'No.'\" Instead, she said, \"We want a path to 'Yes,'\" aiming for an approach that has integrity and unity.\n\nPelosi led opposition Wednesday to the Dodd-Frank bill, helping switch dozens of Democrats who voted for a similar measure last year but opposed it this week. As a result, the legislation failed to get the two-thirds vote needed to clear under expedited rules. Pelosi expects Republicans will bring the bill back under regular rules, but Wednesday's vote proves she can sustain an Obama veto on that, too.\n\nThe reliance on the veto, and President Obama's eagerness to issue threats, has already poisoned the atmosphere on Capitol Hill. House Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, stated that he expects to raise the issue of vetoes with President Obama when the President hosts congressional leaders at the White House next week.\n\nAs Republicans blame Democrats for blocking action, Democrats counter that Republicans are adopting tactics they fought when they were in the minority. The partisan rhetoric and procedural maneuvers have set a contentious tone for the 114th Congress, with both parties digging in their heels and vowing to fight for their respective agendas.",
    " Title: U.S., Allies Accuse Iran of Attacking Oil Tankers Near Strait of Hormuz; Tensions Escalate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has accused Iran of carrying out attacks on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz last week, stating that it is keeping all options on the table, including military strikes, in response. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the attacks were conducted with the intent to deny transit through the strait, through which about a fifth of the world's oil is transported daily.\n\nThe Pentagon released photographs and a grainy black-and-white video on Thursday, purportedly showing Islamic Revolutionary Guard troops removing an unexploded mine from an oil tanker targeted in the Gulf of Oman. According to U.S. Central Command, American forces in the region witnessed and recorded an Iranian boat approaching the oil tanker Kokuka Courageous and removing an unexploded limpet mine from the side of the vessel.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has significant evidence to blame Tehran for the attacks, as stated by Mr. Pompeo. Iran has persistently denied such claims. U.S. officials also claim that limpet mines were used in a May attack on four oil tankers, which the Trump administration has also blamed on Iran.\n\nNot all parties are convinced by the U.S. account of the situation. Germany's foreign minister has requested additional evidence before pointing blame on Tehran, stating that the video released by the Pentagon is not enough to draw conclusions. The Japanese owner of one of the tankers has told of his crew's account of the incident and said the ship was hit by a flying object, not a mine.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, and Britain have joined the U.S. in pointing fingers at Iran. In an interview with Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called on other countries to take a \"decisive stand\" against the attack. Britain plans to send elite military forces to the region in response to the attacks, with Royal Marines scheduled to be deployed to the region in coming weeks and expected to patrol the strait, joining ships stationed at Britain's naval base in Bahrain.\n\nHowever, the British Defense Ministry downplayed the significance of the move, stating that it is a \"pre-planned training deployment and is in no way related to the ongoing situation in the Gulf of Oman.\" As tensions escalate between Washington and Tehran, Mr. Pompeo maintained that the U.S. does not seek war with Iran but will defend itself if necessary.\n\nCongressional leaders have warned that the administration lacks congressional approval to use military force. Mr. Pompeo on Sunday insisted that the administration \"always [ has ] the authorization to defend American interests.\" Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have said the White House can not cite the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force to strike in the Middle East and have reiterated that only Congress can declare war.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in an appearance on CBS that while he believes Iran is behind the attacks, \"congressional approval is necessary to initiate hostilities against Iran.\" Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who sits on the Senate intelligence and Armed Services committees, said retaliatory military strikes against Iran would be warranted.",
    " Title: Tensions Rise Between North Korea and South Korea, Israel Launches Airstrikes Against Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has ordered his military units into a \"semi-war state\" with South Korea following a series of rocket and artillery exchanges on Thursday. The incident marks the most significant such incident in five years, according to The New York Times. Two South Korean soldiers were wounded in a land mine explosion in the demilitarized zone on August 4, for which the South blames the North, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nIn response, the South began broadcasting propaganda in the demilitarized zone, a practice that was common but was agreed to stop in 2004. The North has demanded that the South end its loudspeaker propaganda by Saturday afternoon, or else face an attack from the North; the South has rejected the ultimatum.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel launched two rounds of airstrikes against the Syrian military and allied militant groups in Syria on Thursday and Friday, in response to rocket attacks at the Golan Heights. Israel claims that the rocket attack was conducted by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad and coordinated by Iran, which backs the Syrian government in the country's civil war. Syria's government claims five civilians were killed in the second round of strikes, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says they were pro-government fighters. Israel claimed that they were actually Palestinian members of Islamic Jihad, which has so far denied responsibility for the rocket attacks.\n\nThe Israeli government is already connecting the rocket attacks to the Iran nuclear deal, with Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon alleging the rocket strikes were a \"preview of a richer and more murderous Iran\" after sanctions are lifted. The income models of various artists are also making headlines, as well as speculation about the British Labour Party's support for leftist leadership candidate Jeremy Corbyn, and a new apartment development in London featuring a \"sky pool\" suspended between two buildings with a glass floor. Additionally, there is an increasing number of Bernie Sanders supporters embracing a conspiracy theory in which Black Lives Matter is a Hillary Clinton front meant to destroy Sanders' campaign.

    " Title: ICE Discretionary Releases of Criminal Immigrants Raise Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe release of thousands of illegal immigrant criminals by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last year, many of whom were deemed the top priority for deportation, has sparked controversy due to new numbers obtained by the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. According to the data, over 17,000 of the criminal aliens released in 2014 were released due to ICE's discretion, representing 57 percent of the releases.\n\nIn a statement, ICE stated that it takes release decisions seriously and makes a judgment in each case. The agency pointed out that not all Level 1 criminal aliens are subject to mandatory detention and may be eligible for bond due to mitigating circumstances such as deteriorated health, advanced age, and caretaking responsibilities.\n\nHowever, nearly all of those released under electronic monitoring broke the terms of their release, according to ICE numbers. In fiscal year 2014, ICE put about 41,000 immigrants through electronic monitoring, and more than 30,000 of them broke the terms of their release\u2014many of them racking up multiple violations.\n\nIn a statement to The \u2588\u2588\u2588, ICE said violations can include what they deem minor problems, such as someone lacking a strong enough cell signal for voice verification by phone or someone calling in too early or a few minutes late. Low batteries or jostling an electronic bracelet during sports can also cause a monitoring alarm to go off incorrectly, ICE said.\n\nOf the more than 30,000 detainees who broke the conditional terms of their release and monitoring in 2014, only 2,420 were deemed to have been serious enough breaches to rearrest them.\n\nPart of ICE's problem is that it doesn't have enough beds to go out and pick up violators, according to an inspector general's report released earlier this year. Agency officials said they would like to be able to hold those who willfully break the rules, but they haven't requested more beds. Indeed, President Obama's 2016 budget request actually asked for fewer beds to hold detainees next year, arguing that he wants to put more emphasis on the very alternatives that are being violated.\n\nThe treatment of those awaiting their deportation proceedings has been controversial for several years. In 2013, the agency released 36,007 convicted criminals who were awaiting the outcome of their deportation cases. Those released had amassed 116 homicide convictions, 15,635 drunken driving convictions, and 9,187 convictions stemming from what ICE labeled involvement with \"dangerous drugs.\"\n\nThe total dropped to about 30,000 in 2014\u2014but the seriousness of the offenses increased, with 193 homicide convictions among the detainees and 16,070 drunken driving convictions. There were also 426 sexual assaults and 303 kidnapping convictions, ICE said.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and ICE Director Sarah Saldana said the numbers were unacceptable and imposed new rules requiring releases to be vetted by senior agency officials to make sure they were correct. Both Mr. Johnson and Ms. Saldana also said many of the releases are required and give them little discretion\u2014particularly those made under a 2001 Supreme Court decision known as the Zadvydas case, when the justices ruled that immigrants couldn't generally be detained indefinitely. That means that if a home country won't take someone back, ICE must release them after about six months.\n\nHowever, the new numbers obtained by Mr. Goodlatte suggest Zadvydas-related releases were fewer than 2,500 in 2014, or only about 8 percent of the total\u2014compared to the 57 percent that ICE admits were completely discretionary. The rest of the releases were divided between cases where an immigration judge ordered bond or where ICE was unable to obtain travel documents but it wasn't considered a mandatory release under the Zadvydas ruling.",
    " Title: Media Narrative Suggests Clinton Lead Over Trump in U.S. Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe media coverage of the ongoing United States presidential race indicates a growing consensus that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is favored to win the election, while Republican candidate Donald Trump is facing mounting challenges. This narrative is evident in various news outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, Politico, and Fox News.\n\nHeadlines such as \"Clinton Hopes for a Mandate and Coattails\" and \"Clinton is in a commanding position in the contest to become the 45th president\" suggest a shift in the race's dynamics. The media has also reported on potential cabinet appointments for a Clinton administration and speculated about her policy priorities.\n\nFox's Karl Rove, a prominent Republican strategist, stated that Trump's chances of winning are slim, with headlines like \"ROVE: HE'S TOAST\" appearing in publications like the Huffington Post. Reports of Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results and his perceived poor performance in the third debate have further fueled the narrative of a struggling Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data also supports the idea that Clinton is leading in the race. According to Politico, if Trump were to win all the remaining battleground states, he would still fall short of the necessary 270 electoral votes to secure the presidency. The six states where Clinton currently leads in the polls are showing signs of becoming swing states, a shift from previous elections.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all polls show Clinton with a significant lead. For instance, the L.A. Times poll and an IBD poll suggest a close race, with Clinton and Trump tied or Trump slightly ahead. The election will ultimately be decided in states such as Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Arizona, and a handful of others.\n\nWith less than three weeks remaining until the election, the media's desire for the election to conclude and the public's eagerness for the campaign to end is palpable. However, as Yogi Berra once said, \"It ain't over till it's over.\" The race remains competitive, and the outcome is still uncertain.",
    " Title: U.S. and Romanian Service Members, Civilians Killed in Taliban Suicide Bombing in Kabul\n\nArticle:\n\nA suicide bombing carried out by the Taliban in the center of Kabul on Thursday resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier, a Romanian service member, and at least 10 civilians near the American embassy. The incident occurred near the headquarters of Afghanistan's international military force and the American embassy.\n\nThe American and Romanian service members were both NATO soldiers, according to the NATO Resolute Support mission. The mission confirmed the two service members were \"killed in action,\" but declined to provide further details or release their names. The American soldier was the fourth killed in the past two weeks in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they targeted vehicles of \"foreigners\" trying to enter the heavily guarded Shashdarak area where Afghan national security authorities have offices. The explosion followed a Taliban attack against a foreign compound late Monday that killed at least 16 people and wounded more than 100, almost all of them local civilians.\n\nThe violence continued hours later when the Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bombing outside an Afghan military base in the Logar provincial capital, Puli Alam, with local officials saying four civilians were killed and 11 others wounded. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission also confirmed that its acting leader in Ghor province, Abdul Samad Amiri, had been kidnapped by the Taliban while traveling and shot dead late on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is in Kabul briefing Afghan leaders on the U.S.-Taliban deal to end nearly 18 years of fighting. The Afghan government has raised serious concerns about the deal, including in new comments on Thursday as the latest Kabul bombing occurred. The agreement was moving with \"excessive speed,\" according to presidential adviser Waheed Omer, who warned of difficult days ahead.\n\nThe Taliban, at their strongest since their 2001 defeat by a U.S.-led invasion, have refused to negotiate with the government, calling it a U.S. puppet. The U.S. hopes its deal with the Taliban will bring the militant group to the table for intra-Afghan talks to begin ahead of Afghanistan's presidential election on Sept. 28. The Afghan government has said it shares the concerns raised this week by several former U.S. ambassadors to Afghanistan. They warned that a full U.S. troop withdrawal that moves too quickly and without requiring the Taliban to meet certain conditions, such as reducing violence, could lead to \"total civil war\" such as the one that engulfed the country in the 1990s after a rapid Soviet pullout and before the Taliban swept into power.",

President Donald Trump has reportedly been informed of Rosenstein's plans to depart following the confirmation of Attorney General nominee William Barr.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, during a Wednesday interview on Fox News, all but confirmed the move, stating that Rosenstein \"has always planned to roughly stay around two years.\" Sanders added that there is no intention by the president or the White House to push him out, and suggested that Rosenstein is making room for Barr to build his own team.\n\nBarr's confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee are scheduled for next week. However, sources told The Washington Post that there are no firm plans for Rosenstein's departure or a timeline. NBC News reported that Rosenstein will not leave until Special Counsel Robert Mueller submits his final report.\n\nRosenstein has been overseeing Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election since then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the probe. Trump has frequently criticized the DOJ and the FBI over the investigation, referring to it as a \"witch hunt\" and accusing the departments of bias against him.\n\nTrump forced the resignation of Sessions in November and appointed Sessions's chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, as acting attorney general. Whitaker is currently overseeing the Mueller probe, despite past public criticism of the investigation. If confirmed, Barr would take over for Whitaker in overseeing the investigation.\n\nRosenstein's departure would mark the end of a rocky tenure as deputy attorney general. Speculation swirled late last year that Trump would fire Rosenstein after The New York Times reported that he discussed secretly taping the president and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's North Korea Denuclearization Timeline and Recent Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, stated on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that significant steps toward North Korea's denuclearization could be achieved within a year. However, according to private administration officials, Mr. Bolton's view aligns with his pre-administration stance that North Korea will not entirely abandon its nuclear program.\n\nThe question remains whether North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is genuinely committed to a change in course or is merely buying time with President Trump, as his predecessors were during their interactions with the past four U.S. presidents.\n\nRecent reports suggest that North Korea continues to advance its nuclear and missile programs, despite its denuclearization pledge. In response, President Trump boasted on Twitter on Tuesday that there have been no rocket launches or nuclear tests in the past eight months, crediting his administration for the peace. He also claimed that without him, the United States would be at war with North Korea.\n\nWhile there has been a freeze in missile and nuclear tests since November, this does not equate to denuclearization. North Korea retains all its nuclear capabilities and can resume testing at any time. This was previously deemed insufficient by former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson because it merely maintained the ability to strike, an intolerable position that President Trump had previously characterized.\n\nThe lack of military exercises between the United States and South Korea and the reduced tension between the two countries are evidence of North Korea's success in lowering the heat. The Trump administration's tendency to equate a good meeting with a good outcome is highlighted in this critical national security crisis. This resembles President John F. Kennedy's declaration of the Cold War's resolution after his meeting with Soviet Union's Nikita Khrushchev in 1961, followed by the Cuban missile crisis 16 months later.\n\nIn this ongoing situation, it is crucial to distinguish between a temporary freeze and the ultimate goal of denuclearization. The timeline and progress toward this goal remain uncertain, and the international community continues to monitor developments closely.",
    " Title: California's Proposition 8: A Turning Point in the Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nSupporters and opponents of California's Proposition 8, the controversial measure banning same-sex marriage, have reached a consensus on one point: Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing marked a significant milestone.\n\nNowlin Haltom, a real estate agent in Studio City, Los Angeles, expressed his sentiments, \"I can't believe we have come this far, frankly.\" Haltom, who married his partner of 15 years in New York two years ago, has been an active participant in the fight for same-sex marriage rights for a long time.\n\nOn the opposing side, Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, stated, \"The Supreme Court is considering toying with thousands of years of human history.\" He argued, \"There is nothing in the history of the world culture that supports redefining marriage as an institution between a man and a man or a woman and a woman.\"\n\nThe potential outcomes from Tuesday's arguments range from the case being dismissed to a broad ruling on whether there is a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry. Rebecca Brown, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of law, explained, \"They've heard all the arguments, now they will go away and sort through them.\" A decision is expected by early June.\n\nHaltom, a Vietnam veteran, is hopeful but cautious. He expressed concerns about the implications of the ruling on his own relationship, as his husband would not be entitled to collect Haltom's Social Security check upon his death.\n\nWildmon, however, suggests that a broad Supreme Court ruling in support of same-sex marriage would contradict the majority opinion in America. Though polls show that more than 50 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage, he notes that 31 states have created legislation defining marriage as being only between a man and a woman.\n\nPaul Linton, special counsel at The Thomas More Society, a national anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage advocacy group in Chicago, indicates that the court might be wary of making a broad ruling. For instance, Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concerns about heading into \"uncharted waters.\"\n\nLinton expressed his concerns about the potential negative impact of a broad decision, suggesting it could lead to some states calling for a constitutional amendment, which might necessitate Congress to convene a convention. He noted that such a convention has not been used in the history of the United States since the original Constitutional Convention of 1789, but if two-thirds of the states demanded it, it could occur.",
    " Title: Cost Analysis of Various Universal Healthcare Plans in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the ongoing debate among Democrats regarding the expansion of healthcare access and President Trump's promise of a future \"phenomenal\" plan, significant changes are expected in the U.S. health care system. The leading Democratic presidential candidates have discussed the merits of Medicare for All during recent debates, but this is just one of several options under consideration.\n\nA study released by a team of researchers from the Urban Institute on Wednesday examines different healthcare reform plans. Among other findings, the report suggests that it is possible to achieve universal healthcare without drastically overhauling the current system or causing federal expenditures to skyrocket.\n\nThe study compares the costs of three universal healthcare plans: Medicare for All, an \"enhanced\" Medicare-for-All plan, and a \"lite\" Medicare-for-All plan.\n\n1. Medicare for All: The report estimates that Medicare for All would cost $34 trillion over 10 years. This plan would cover everyone in the U.S., including undocumented immigrants, and offer more benefits than the current system, such as dental, vision, hearing, and long-term services and supports. Employer spending on health care would decrease by $955 billion, and household spending would fall by $887 billion. However, $2.7 trillion in additional federal revenue would be needed to finance the new program.\n\n2. \"Enhanced\" Medicare-for-All plan: This plan, which covers everyone in the U.S. (including undocumented immigrants) and offers more benefits than the current system, would raise national spending on health care by nearly $3 trillion in 2020 and $34 trillion, or $32 trillion after tax offsets, over 10 years. Employer spending on health care would decrease by $955 billion, and household spending would fall by $887 billion, but $2.7 trillion in additional federal revenue would be needed to finance the new program.\n\n3. \"Lite\" Medicare-for-All plan: This plan, which covers all legal residents in the U.S. but not the 10.8 million undocumented immigrants in the country, would cost roughly $17.6 trillion over 10 years. This plan would reduce national spending on health care by about $209 billion in 2020. Federal spending would increase by $1.5 trillion in the first year, but total health-care spending would fall by about $210 billion as a result of lower provider payment rates and administrative savings.\n\nThe study also presents a plan that includes some out-of-pocket expenses based on income and a less generous set of expanded benefits. This plan, which would cover all legal residents in the U.S. but not the 10.8 million undocumented immigrants in the country, would reduce national spending on health care by about $209 billion in 2020. Federal spending would increase by $1.5 trillion in the first year, but total health-care spending would fall by about $210 billion as a result of lower provider payment rates and administrative savings.\n\nMedicare for All is not the only path to universal coverage. One of the plans in the report, involving a mix of private and public health insurance, would cover everyone in the U.S. except for 6.6 million undocumented immigrants. The plan would beef up Obamacare subsidies, expand Medicaid to all states, provide a public option, and cap payment rates. Federal spending would increase by $122.1 billion if implemented next year and by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, but total national health spending would fall by $22.6 billion in 2020.\n\nSara Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, which funded the study, said that the report shows that universal health care coverage \"can be reached in different ways\" \u2013 and, we should add, with very different costs.",
    " Title: Record-Breaking Republican Primary Turnout in Multiple States\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 240,000 new Democrats and independents participated in Virginia's Republican presidential primary this week, marking a significant shift in voter demographics. This trend is also observed in other major states, with over 535,000 new Democrats and independents in Texas, 175,000 in Georgia, 172,000 in Tennessee, and 143,000 in Alabama, according to an analysis of exit polling compared to the 2008 race.\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican front-runner, attributes this growth to his campaign efforts. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Trump declared, \"We have expanded the Republican Party.\" He claimed that longtime Democrats and independents have switched their allegiance to the Republican Party due to his campaign.\n\nExit polling data supports Mr. Trump's claim, with nearly 10 million people casting ballots in the 15 primaries and caucuses so far, representing about 4 million more votes than in the same Republican races in 2008. Mr. Trump has won about a third of the votes, building a formidable and durable coalition that spans moderates and evangelicals, draws heavily from self-identified independents, and tilts toward older and less-educated supporters.\n\nThe increased Republican turnout is evident in the number of record-breaking contests, with 14 of the 15 Republican contests so far setting records for turnout. In contrast, Democratic turnout has decreased by more than 30% compared to the 2008 elections, with the exception of Colorado's caucuses.\n\nDemocrats attribute the difference in turnout to the larger Republican field, which had 12 candidates in Iowa compared to the Democrats' three. In Super Tuesday races, Republicans had five candidates, while the Democrats were down to two: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that when the votes were tallied in states such as Virginia, Hillary Clinton ended up with more support in her two-person race than any of the five Republican candidates did. He suggested that this indicates ample enthusiasm on the Democratic side, particularly in key general election states.\n\nRepublican leaders are optimistic about the overall turnout in Virginia, as it could indicate a potential recapture of the state, which President Obama won in 2008 and 2012. John Findlay, executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, stated, \"Nearly 240,000 more voters chose to cast a ballot for Republican candidates versus Hillary or Bernie.\"\n\nThe White House, however, suggests that some of the massive Republican turnout is due to hostility toward Donald Trump, implying that he could be a drag on the party if he is the nominee in November. Some voters, like Cori DeFrancis, a 61-year-old consignment shop owner in Atlanta, are searching for an anti-Trump strategy. Ms. DeFrancis supported Sen. Marco Rubio in the Republican primary because she thought he had the best chance of beating Mr. Trump.\n\nDespite concerns about Mr. Trump's brash comments and stance on immigration, he has won Hispanic voters at nearly the same rate as his overall vote total in states with sizable Hispanic populations, such as Nevada and Texas. Mr. Trump's coalition hits the Republican sweet spot, with his strongest support coming from voters who identify as \"somewhat conservative,\" while holding his own among very conservative and moderate voters.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Recall Election: Collective Bargaining Issue Sidelined in Governor Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming June 5 recall election for Wisconsin's governorship, the contentious issue of collective bargaining rights, which sparked significant protests and a national debate in 2011, has taken a back seat in the campaign. The Democratic candidate, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, has minimized the issue in speeches, advertisements, and debates, focusing instead on the tactics of incumbent Governor Scott Walker.\n\nDuring the second televised debate, Barrett acknowledged that he was not the preferred candidate of public unions, a fact he wore as a badge of honor. Barrett defeated the labor movement's preferred candidate, former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, in the May primary. Fak had pledged to veto the next state budget unless it restored public employees' collective-bargaining rights. Barrett refused to commit to such a maneuver, although he supports restoring collective-bargaining rights using other tactics.\n\nThe decision to downplay the collective-bargaining issue allows Barrett to distance himself from allegations that he is acting on behalf of organized labor and may attract independent voters who are not favorable towards unions. However, this strategy may harm him and other Democrats in their final push to mobilize voters, as the issue could be crucial in a race that might hinge on turnout.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus criticized the Democrats for their lack of focus on collective bargaining, calling it a \"dead dog loser\" for the left. Instead of attacking Walker on labor rights, Barrett has been campaigning on ethical questions surrounding a John Doe criminal probe that has led to the indictment of several former Walker aides. He has also accused the governor of using deceptive political tactics and courting the tea party. Barrett's recent advertisements have focused on the John Doe investigation and job creation.",
    " Title: White House Response to Mass Shootings: Las Vegas and New York City\n\nArticle:\n\nIn two separate incidents in October 2017, a gunman in Las Vegas and an immigrant from Uzbekistan in New York City caused mass casualties, resulting in 58 deaths in Las Vegas and eight in New York City. The White House's response to these events, particularly in terms of policy discussions, varied significantly.\n\nFollowing the Las Vegas shooting on October 1, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that the event was a time for consoling the survivors and mourning the deceased. When asked about pursuing tighter gun laws, Sanders emphasized that it was not the appropriate time for political debate but rather a time for national unity. An open and ongoing law enforcement investigation was ongoing, and a motive for the shooting was yet to be determined, making it premature to discuss policy changes.\n\nIn contrast, the response to the New York City incident on October 31 was markedly different. On that day, Donald Trump tweeted about ISIS before offering thoughts, condolences, and prayers. He then called for strengthening the already existing Extreme Vetting Program, citing the need to be politically correct but not for this situation.\n\nWhen asked if the New York City incident was a time when the discussion should not be political but rather a policy discussion, Sanders responded that the day was one of reflection, mourning, and gratitude for those who were saved. She indicated that there would be time for policy discussions in the future but not at that moment.\n\nInterestingly, just a day after the Las Vegas shooting, which resulted in 58 deaths, the White House was focused on mourning and unity, while on November 1, Trump was attacking Sen. Chuck Schumer for sponsoring a bipartisan immigration plan in 1990 and calling for a change to immigration policy. This shift in tone and focus occurred just one day after the New York City incident.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Hesitant to Endorse Trump and Carson Amidst Questions of Electability\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential front-runners Donald Trump and Ben Carson have yet to receive endorsements from Capitol Hill lawmakers despite their agendas being supported by most members and popular with voters back home. The hesitation to endorse the two outsider candidates at the front of the race has affected Republican lawmakers of all stripes, from establishment stalwarts to renegade tea partyers.\n\nWhen pressed about the lack of endorsements, most lawmakers cited it being too early or having too many candidates to choose from, not that Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson are too far outside the mainstream to risk associating themselves with them. However, some Republicans have openly questioned Mr. Trump's ability to reach the White House or perform the job if elected.\n\nRep. Trent Franks, Arizona Republican and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus that helped force out former Speaker John A. Boehner, stated, \"I think Mr. Trump would be hard to elect.\" Franks, who has endorsed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for the Republican presidential nomination, pledged to support Mr. Trump if he wins the nomination.\n\nRep. John Fleming, another Freedom Caucus member, expressed a concern shared privately by most lawmakers: he doesn't fully trust Mr. Trump. \"He uses a lot of broad statements in the way that Barack Obama did, and these things can become fill-in-the-blanks. In other words, you hear what you want to hear, and then you get a surprise down the road,\" the Louisiana Republican said.\n\n\"We just have to be careful. I want to know more about what does Donald Trump want to do with our foreign policy, other than saying that he is a tough negotiator against China and other places. I want to actually know what he intends to do in Afghanistan and Iraq and places like that. I really don't know what he intends to do,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers generally handled the affable Mr. Carson more gently. Rep. Peter T. King, New York Republican, said Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson still must \"prove themselves\" to win more support from elected leaders. \"Trump and Carson have to show they know what the job is about, not just be media stars,\" he said.\n\nDoug Heye, a Washington-based Republican political consultant, said that electability is a major reason lawmakers are not jumping on the Trump or Carson bandwagons\u2014nobody wants to end up behind a loser. \"Every historical pattern we know tells us that Trump and Carson are unlikely to win the nomination. That may end up not being the case, but it explains why members have not endorsed,\" said Heye, who served as a top adviser to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele.\n\nThe Carson campaign stated that the retired neurosurgeon deliberately has not solicited endorsements from a single governor, senator, or congressman. \"Political endorsements will come in due time. They are not a priority for our campaign attention,\" said Carson campaign spokesman Doug Watts.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the dearth of endorsements contrasts with his strong push to crack down on illegal immigration and negotiate tougher trade deals with China and other trading partners\u2014stances backed by conservative Republicans in Congress.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, has never endorsed a candidate in a presidential primary, but he said that could change. And he disagreed that his colleagues were afraid to endorse Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson. \"Most people are a little slow to endorse. We don't have many endorsements for any candidate,\" he said.\n\nOther GOP contenders have managed to pick up endorsements on Capitol Hill, arguably regardless of their overall electability. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina was endorsed by three House members; Mr. Huckabee has received endorsements from two senators and four congressmen; Mr. Rubio got two senators and eight House members; and Mr. Cruz was endorsed by seven House members.\n\nSen. Rand Paul was endorsed by eight congressmen and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian whom Mr. Paul backed in a tough 2014 reelection race. Jeb Bush collected the most endorsements in Congress: three current senators and 23 current House members.\n\n\"There's a profound long-term loyalty to the Bushes,\" said Rep. Kenny Marchant, Texas Republican. He said that many lawmakers could be withholding endorsements from Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson in deference to the Bush family and former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\n\nUnder that scenario, they would begin to flock to one of the front-runners if Jeb Bush drops out of the race. Lingering policy questions and doubts about electability haven't deterred voters who consistently boost Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson to the top of the polls.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Carson were neck and neck at 24 percent and 23 percent, respectively, in a nationwide poll of likely GOP voters that Quinnipiac University released Wednesday. The next-closest candidates were Mr. Rubio with 14 percent, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas with 13 percent, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with 8 percent, according to the poll.\n\nRep. Alexander X. Mooney, a first-term West Virginia Republican, said he hadn't endorsed anyone because he is torn between several candidates with whom he has relationships. In a tough seven-way primary election that Mr. Mooney won in 2014, he had Mr. Huckabee campaign for him, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum helped his campaign, and Mr. Trump sent him an unsolicited $1,000 check.\n\n\"I think part of it is who do you have relationships with. What members of Congress know Ben Carson or Donald Trump personally?\" he asked. \"There is a reluctance, but, on the other hand, if some of these candidates falter\u2014look at Scott Walker. He went from No. 1 to No. 9 in Iowa and dropped out, \" he said. \"What's the hurry? Let's let it shake out.\"",
    " Title: Frustration Mounts Over Lack of Details on Immigration Detainee Release\n\nArticle:\n\nState and federal authorities are expressing frustration over the lack of specific details from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding the release of immigration detainees in preparation for today's sequester. The Department of Homeland Security's response to the announcement that illegal immigrants would be freed from detention centers to save money is only that \"hundreds have been released across the country.\" Lawmakers and local officials in border states are seeking answers about the number of detainees released, the involved detention centers, and the cost savings goal.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, has demanded answers from ICE Director John Morton by March 6. In a letter to Morton, McCaul expressed concern that the releases were undertaken without notification to the appropriate Congressional oversight committees.\n\nPinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Paul Babeu also demanded answers from DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, stating that he was inexplicably kept out of the loop despite being the top law enforcement official in the county where the releases occurred. El Paso and San Diego, both highly active border regions, were informed by ICE officials ahead of the releases.\n\nEl Paso Sheriff Richard Wiles said his agency was informed by ICE of their plans, but still did not know how many detainees have been released this week. San Diego County Sheriff William Gore was also made aware of ICE's plans and expressed no concerns over the move.\n\nA forewarning of the current release policy emerged from a letter Napolitano sent to Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairwoman of the Committee on Appropriations, on Jan. 31. In the letter, Napolitano stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not be able to sustain current detention and removal operations or maintain the 34,000 detention beds mandated by Congress. This would significantly roll back progress that resulted in record-high removals.\n\nThere is also concern about the prospect of cutbacks in Border Patrol agents along the border, which could affect progress made in recent years. Napolitano told Mikulski that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) would not be able to maintain current staffing levels of Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers as mandated by Congress. This could increase wait times at airports, affect security between land ports of entry, affect CBP's ability to collect revenue owed to the Federal Government, and slow screening and entry programs for those traveling into the United States.\n\nA freshman Congressman who knows the U.S.-Mexico border firsthand says the recent decision by the Department of Homeland Security to release low-risk detainees may actually be a solution to a festering problem. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) of El Paso, Texas, who sits on the House Committee on Homeland Security with McCaul, told FoxNews.com that there is bi-partisan agreement that there are too many people being detained in ICE facilities that do not belong there. O'Rourke stated that the decision this week by Napolitano to release low-risk detainees as a cost-saving measure may actually be a harbinger for where the federal immigration policy should be heading.\n\n\"The detention centers are a horribly broken element of our immigration policy,\" O'Rourke said. \"These people being released are not serious criminals and do not pose a threat to the United States.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Health Care Reform and the Supreme Court Ruling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare,\" President Barack Obama and his advisers are grappling with the potential loss of the law's universal coverage provision. According to Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, if Obama loses both his legal challenge and his re-election, many will conclude that he \"bet on his major reform, and the Supreme Court defeated it, and he lost his hold on the presidency.\"\n\nDuring the court's deliberation, Obama and his advisers have moved from denial to a surprising new state, which might be called \"Living Without Universal Coverage.\" Former advisers are emphasizing the law's other aspects, such as subsidies to buy insurance, and some aides argue that losing the mandate could be a political boon, as it would remove Republicans' core complaint against the law.\n\nHowever, this position is uncomfortable for a deeper reason, one that goes to the core of who Obama wanted to be as president. Earlier in his term, he refused every chance to settle for a more limited health care overhaul, making epic sacrifices to win something far broader.\n\nBefore becoming president, critics said that Obama's greatest achievement was his own rise, that he played it safe rather than taking risks for what he really believed. Early in the presidential race, Obama sought advice from historian Doris Kearns Goodwin about Abraham Lincoln, already talking about leaving a legacy and accomplishing vast things.\n\nIn the White House, many of his top advisers, including Vice President Joe Biden and his first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, counseled Obama against a sweeping health care overhaul. By summer 2009, with the country still stunned by the economic crisis and Republicans falsely raising the specter of death panels, some aides practically begged the president to scale back, take interim steps, and move on to other issues.\n\nMr. Obama did not relent. He had an economic rationale for stabilizing a dysfunctional health system, but he also \"saw what Teddy called the moral issue,\" Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's widow, said in an interview, referring to her husband. For those who wondered what Obama really believed in, universal health coverage seemed to be the answer.\n\nAs the brutal fight continued, the president sacrificed more and more in its name: an overhaul of energy and environmental laws, greater focus on economic issues, some of his own popularity, and that of House Democrats, who eventually lost their hard-won majority. \"Michelle and I are perfectly comfortable if we're only here one term if we feel like we really accomplished something,\" he told aides.\n\nThat declaration sounds different today. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, uses \"Obamacare\" as an epithet and applause line, promising outright repeal if he wins. A few years ago, the health care law seemed a reason for Mr. Obama to risk losing re-election; now, it is a reason he feels he must win re-election.\n\nAs he awaits the decision, Mr. Obama has no more knowledge of or influence on it than any of the other lawyers handicapping the odds in Washington bars and boardrooms. The former law professor turned president is scathing about the argument that the mandate violates the Constitution, saying it has no merit whatsoever.\n\nIf the court strikes down the mandate and Mr. Obama wins in November, he could face one last version of his perpetual choice on health care: would he settle, learning to live with a sharply edited law? ( Given that Republicans see the bill as a signature piece of big-government overreach, he might have no choice.) Or would he expend yet more precious capital on health care?\n\nEzekiel Emanuel, Rahm's brother and a former health adviser to the president, predicted the second path. \"Too much of the president's legacy\u2014and the good of the country\u2014is tied up with this,\" he said. The final result on health care will help determine whether Mr. Obama is the game-changing president he aspired to be.",
    " Title: \"Bipartisan 'Gang of Eight' Senators Collaborate on Immigration Reform in Washington\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of eight senators, known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" have been meeting in private several times a week, alternating between the offices of Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). The group, which includes Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), is working to overhaul the nation's complex immigration laws.\n\nThe senators are meeting in a collaborative effort, despite including some of the Senate's most prominent personalities and individuals with political challenges. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is up for re-election next year and facing a potential GOP primary challenge from the right, described the experience as \"one of the best experiences I've had.\" He added, \"It's sort of what I came up here to do -- sit down with serious people to solve serious and hard problems.\"\n\nThe group has been meeting for an hour or an hour-and-a-half on days when the Senate is in session. The meetings are held in a confidential manner, with no reporters present, and aides stand or sit in the background. The senators are assiduous about avoiding leaks and are tight-lipped on the details of their discussions.\n\nThe legislation the group is working on aims to secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country, contingent on a secure border first, crack down on employers, and improve legal immigration. Senators have indicated some consensus on elements related to border security and the path to citizenship. However, they are struggling on the question of legal immigration and future workers, and are trading proposals with leaders of the AFL-CIO and Chamber of Commerce to try to reach a deal.\n\nThe senators have been working toward a self-imposed March deadline to release their legislation, although it now seems that might slip until they return from a two-week recess the second week of April. They would aim for a vote in the Judiciary Committee soon thereafter, then consideration by the full Senate and from there, the House. Success is far from assured, and the process could fail at any point.\n\nThe group came together when Graham phoned Schumer the weekend after the November election. The resounding victory among Latino voters had just sealed Obama's win and underscored to Republicans like McCain and Graham that the GOP needed to act on immigration. Schumer, McCain, and Graham are veterans of past failed attempts on the issue, most prominently in 2007 when legislation backed by then-President George W. Bush failed on the Senate floor.\n\nSchumer later recounted that Graham said, \"The band is back, let's do immigration,\" and told him McCain was on board. \"And my heart went pitter patter,\" Schumer said in telling the anecdote at a breakfast hosted by Politico in January. The senators worked to round up others, with Flake saying Schumer approached him during Congress's lame-duck session. \"I said I just always wanted to be part of a gang. I grew up in Snowflake, Ariz., the South side didn't offer much,\" Flake said. Rubio had been shopping his own immigration proposals that dovetailed with what the senators were working on.\n\nThe Gang of Eight began working on drafting principles. They were forced to speed up their timetable when they learned Obama planned to announce his own proposals and they rolled out their blueprint at a packed news conference at the Capitol on Jan. 28. Since then, they've had little to say publicly as they work toward releasing their bill, except to voice cautious optimism that this time they will finally succeed in solving a problem that has bedeviled Washington for decades. \"Everybody there wants to get it done and nobody's looking for political points or political advantage,\" Flake said. \"Everybody's looking to get it done, and that makes all the difference.\"",
    " Title: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Meets Taliban Officials in Qatar to Discuss Compliance with US-Taliban Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is meeting Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar, on Monday as part of efforts to salvage a historic deal signed with the armed group in February. The highest-level talks ever between the United States and the Taliban, as described by the U.S. State Department, aim to press the Taliban to continue complying with the agreement.\n\nAccording to State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, Secretary Pompeo will meet with Taliban chief negotiator Mullah Baradar to discuss the agreement signed last month. The meeting is set to take place at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base, which has served as the host for a year of talks between the United States and the Taliban.\n\nPrior to his meeting with Taliban officials, Pompeo met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his longtime rival Abdullah Abdullah in Kabul. Their standoff has stalled the selection of a negotiating team to represent the Afghan government in planned talks with the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S.-Taliban agreement, signed in Qatar on February 29, includes a provision for organizing talks between the Afghan leadership and the Taliban to achieve lasting peace in the war-torn country. Formal talks have not yet begun, hampered by disagreement over the release of prisoners, a condition set by the Taliban, and the feud between Ghani and Abdullah.\n\nThe February deal also calls for the gradual withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign troops over a 14-month period, with the main focus of U.S. diplomatic efforts being the withdrawal. The first phase of that withdrawal has already begun, though some troop movements have been slowed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn exchange, the Taliban committed not to allow Afghan soil to be used against American security interests and promised to negotiate for the first time with the West-backed Kabul leadership. However, since the Doha agreement was signed, the Taliban have continued to carry out attacks.\n\nPompeo's visit comes at a time when much global travel has been stalled by the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected over 360,000 and killed more than 15,000 globally.

Ron Johnson (R-WI) concluded a two-day visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with a press briefing, emphasizing the Trump administration's commitment to border security and immigration enforcement. The officials stood on an access road on the U.S. side of the border and criticized jurisdictions labeled as'sanctuary cities,' including California.\n\nSecretary Kelly reaffirmed the administration's commitment to a \"physical barrier\" along the southern border and the importance of stopping human trafficking. He cited drastic reductions in the number of illegal border crossings, which he attributed to the Trump administration's focus on border security and immigration law enforcement.\n\nAttorney General Sessions spoke about the progress made by the Trump administration and warned about the danger of infiltration by gangs like MS-13. He also launched a broadside against sanctuary cities, citing the case of Kate Steinle, an American woman who was shot and killed in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant with seven prior felony convictions who had been deported five times. Sessions accused the city of releasing the shooter from custody despite a federal immigration authorities' detainer request.\n\nSessions threatened legal action against nine jurisdictions, including California, that have policies potentially violating federal law and receive millions in federal grants. The California State Senate recently passed a \"sanctuary state\" bill, SB 54, which awaits passage by the State Assembly before proceeding to Governor Jerry Brown's desk.\n\nJohnson, who serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, praised the Trump administration's support for border patrol and law enforcement. He rejected the argument by sanctuary cities that enforcing immigration law would hurt local policing, describing it as more of an \"excuse\" than a reason.\n\nOutside the event, about a dozen demonstrators from the Remembrance Project, which commemorates victims killed by illegal aliens, gathered to support the Trump administration's efforts.

    " Title: 7.1-Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Southern California, Causing Damage and Evacuations\n\nArticle:\n\nA 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit the town of Ridgecrest, California, on Friday night, marking the second significant earthquake to occur in the area in less than two days. The earthquake, centered 11 miles northeast of Ridgecrest, released 11 times the amount of energy of Thursday's quake, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n\nThe earthquake caused infrastructure damage, cracked streets, and foundation issues in Southern California, sending terrified residents into the streets. Ridgecrest resident Jaye Krona described the earthquake as her \"rocking chair gone crazy.\"\n\nJason Corona, who co-owns a Mexican restaurant in Ridgecrest, was present during the earthquake. He stated that the quake felt different from previous ones, with bottles falling behind the bar, patrons dropping to the floor, and spilled food making a slippery getaway for frightened guests who sprinted outside.\n\nSince Friday's quake, the region has experienced an average of one aftershock per minute, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS) website. More than 4,700 quakes have occurred since Thursday, said USGS geophysicist John Bellini.\n\nGas leaks caused structure fires throughout Ridgecrest, residents reported water main breaks, and power and communications were out in some areas, according to Mark Ghilarducci, director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Management. Several injuries were reported, and Kern County Fire Chief David Witt stated that he knew of no fatalities.\n\nIn the aftermath of the earthquake, about 130 residents from Bakersfield and Trona were staying in a temporary shelter. Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Kern County on Thursday and in San Bernardino late Friday. Newsom also requested a presidential emergency declaration for assistance, which President Donald Trump approved on Saturday.\n\nNaval Air Weapons Station China Lake, a US weapons testing facility near Ridgecrest, sustained infrastructure damage as a result of the earthquakes on Thursday and Friday. The air station authorized the evacuation of non-essential personnel and dependents.\n\nIn the aftermath of the earthquake, there were no major reports of gas leaks or serious injuries in Kern County, but calls came in for ambulance and medical assistance. The San Bernardino County Fire Department reported damage from northwest communities, including homes shifting, foundation cracks, retaining walls down, and one minor injury.\n\nTrona, a town of 2,000 people, does not have power or water, according to San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Jeremy Kern. Both earthquakes disrupted the main water system, and officials are bringing in water to residents and fire teams.\n\nThere were two reports of burglary in Ridgecrest, police chief Jed McLaughlin said. In Los Angeles, about 150 miles south of Ridgecrest, residents felt the quakes, but no reports of serious damage were made, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti. The LA County Fire Department reported no major damage, deaths, or serious injuries, but said some wires were down, and power was out in some locations.\n\nThe USGS stated that the chance of another magnitude 7 or higher earthquake is 3%, while the chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake hitting the area is more than 99%.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo Maintains Pressure on Venezuela, Military Intervention Not Excluded\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged the Venezuelan government led by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to relent in the face of escalating unrest in the country, stating that all options, including military intervention, remain on the table. In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Pompeo said, \"Every option is on the table.\" He further added that the U.S. is committed to ensuring the voice of the Venezuelan people is heard, democracy prevails, and a brighter future is secured for the people of Venezuela.\n\nThe unrest in Venezuela intensified after troops loyal to Maduro obstructed a U.S.-backed effort to deliver foreign aid, resulting in violence along the country's border with Colombia. The troops targeted protesters aligned with opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, causing several deaths and hundreds of injuries through the use of tear gas.\n\nThe Trump administration, along with several European nations, has supported Guaid\u00f3 since he declared himself interim president last month. In an effort to appeal to a bloc of Venezuelan-American voters who have fled to Florida due to economic instability in their home country, President Trump held a rally in Miami last week to denounce Maduro and socialism.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates have also called on Maduro to cease violence against his own citizens, going as far as labeling Maduro a dictator.\n\nPompeo confirmed that the U.S. will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people and hold Maduro accountable. In a separate interview on CNN's State of the Union, Pompeo stated, \"There's more sanctions to be had. More humanitarian assistance that we can provide.\" He further added, \"The Venezuelan people will ultimately, I believe, hold accountable those who have done so much harm to the fundamental, basic rights of the people of Venezuela.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Increases Special Operations Forces in Syria to Combat Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's announcement on Monday that 250 Special Operations Forces will be deployed to Syria indicates a potential shift in the U.S.'s approach to combating the Islamic State. The move follows the deployment of 50 special operators to Syria last fall as a trial run to assess the effectiveness of U.S. training for Kurdish fighters and Arab Sunnis on the ground.\n\nAccording to Melissa Dalton, a former intelligence analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency, the initial deployment aimed to determine if the U.S. could use training to gain traction with local forces. On Monday, Obama stated that the expertise of the Special Operations Forces already in Syria has been crucial in driving Islamic State forces out of key areas.\n\nThe decision to increase the number of Special Operations Forces in Syria appears to be an attempt to accelerate the process. As Dalton notes, \"there\u2019s been some positive momentum built up, with the idea now being, \u2018OK, if we expand that out a bit further \u2013 multiply the amount of trainers in the country \u2013 then perhaps we can multiply the effects.'\"\n\nHowever, questions remain. With a diplomatic cease-fire faltering, the U.S. seems to be focusing more on a military strategy, despite failing to define a clear end state. Dalton questions, \"Where are we building to? Is this the first of many incremental increases \u2013 and to what end?\"\n\nSome argue that building out the program incrementally makes sense. Nicholas Heras, a Middle East analyst at the Center for a New American Security, states, \"incrementalism is the right approach.\" He believes that the U.S. can empower anti-Islamic State forces in a proven way without becoming embroiled in a Middle East war.\n\nThe increased deployment mirrors another decision made last week, with more U.S. troops heading to Iraq in expanded roles. Defense Secretary Ash Carter described these roles as bringing U.S. troops \"closer to the action.\" With Obama expressing a desire to keep the U.S. out of another war in the Middle East, the increase in Syria from 50 to 300 Special Operations Forces is seen as a relatively low-risk move.\n\nIn the past, the U.S. has made more grandiose efforts at fighting the Islamic State. Before the U.S. sent over its 50 special operators last fall, it attempted a $500 million effort to train Syrian anti-ISIS forces. However, the result was only \"four or five\" fighters on the battlefield, according to Gen. Lloyd Austin.\n\nDespite the limited results, the Syrian rebels in the program were reportedly receiving \"terrific training,\" according to Christine Wormuth, the Pentagon's policy chief. The answer was to pivot to the 50 special operators, who have worked on refining their message to potential recruits.\n\nThe trainers have also had some success in expanding the number of Syrian Arabs within the Syrian Democratic Forces, according to Heras. This is important in building trust among anti-ISIS forces, as Kurds have been the U.S. forces' most reliable partners, but Syrian Arabs distrust them.\n\nA greater ethnic mix of forces battling ISIS could help in the long run. If these troops can ultimately take back control of their hometowns, they must find a way to live together and govern \u2013 a more challenging proposition than winning on the battlefield.",
    " Title: U.S. Senator Jeff Flake Compares President Trump's Media Criticism to Joseph Stalin's Propaganda\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has compared President Donald J. Trump's criticism of the media to the totalitarian dictator Joseph Stalin's propaganda during an interview on ABC News' \"This Week.\"\n\nDuring a discussion about a series of speeches the soon-to-be-retired Senator will be delivering over the next few weeks, host George Stephanopoulos read an excerpt from one of the speeches.\n\nStephanopoulos: \"We've gotten some excerpts of what you're planning to say, taking on the president's comments about calling the press the enemy of the people. And I just want to read a portion of what we've had. It's a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase 'enemy of the people' that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use. And of course, the president has it precisely backward. Despotism is the enemy of the people, the free press is the despot's enemy.\"\n\nFlake: \"Well, what I'm trying to say is, you know, you\u2014you can talk about crowd size and this is pretty innocuous if there's a falsehood. But when you reflexively refer to the press as the enemy of the people or fake news, that has real damage. It has real damage to our standing in the world. And I noted how\u2014how bad it is for a president to\u2014to take what was popularized by Joseph Stalin, the enemy of the people, to refer to the press. And then now, today, you have authoritarians across the world using the term 'fake news' to justify cracking down on their opposition or\u2014or stanch legitimate debate. That's nothing we should be proud of. And so I'm going to talk about how damaging that is. It'll be I think on the same day, probably, Wednesday, that the president is giving out some fake news awards.\"\n\nAccording to Cortney, Flake's disdain, put mildly, for Donald Trump is well-documented. Previously on \"This Week,\" Flake has attacked Trump supporters as angry and resentful. The hostility between Flake and Trump started when the discovery of Flake's \"secret\" book, \"Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle,\" in which he criticized Trump's agenda, was made public. Trump mocked the senator at a rally in Phoenix following the discovery.",
    " Title: The Spread of Misinformation in Family Group Chats: A Sociological Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn times of crisis, people often find solace in sharing information with their family members. During periods of high uncertainty, group discussions can provide a sense of understanding and control over the situation. However, a study by sociologist Emma Spiro, as reported in Science magazine, suggests that these discussions can lead to the dissemination of information that appeals to individuals rather than facts.\n\nCailin O' Connor, an associate professor of philosophy at UC Irvine, explains that people are more likely to believe misinformation when it comes from those with whom they have close ties. The degree of social and cultural similarity between individuals plays a significant role in the trust placed in the information shared. O' Connor states, \"The closer you perceive yourself to [be to] someone... the more you trust the information they're sharing.\" This dynamic is particularly prevalent in family group chats.\n\nA 2019 study in Science Advances found that people from older generations tend to share misinformation nearly seven times more frequently than younger family members, even when factors such as education and partisan affiliation were taken into account. This trend may be exacerbated in family group chats, as many members may be less familiar with social media and less adept at filtering out misinformation.\n\nDespite recognizing the misinformation shared by family members, addressing it can be challenging due to the close bonds between individuals. A 2019 study found that only 21% of people surveyed in the U.K. reported correcting others who shared false or inaccurate information. O' Connor suggests that this number is likely to be even smaller in family group chats due to the discomfort of disagreeing with loved ones. O' Connor states, \"Within families, it can be a powerful force. When someone is saying, \u2018Oh, I believe X,\u2019 it pushes others just to accept it rather than to say, \u2018Well, you\u2019re wrong about X.\u2019\"\n\nIn the context of the \"Plandemic\" video, the article does not provide specific guidance on how to respond. However, the information presented highlights the importance of critical thinking and fact-checking when sharing or receiving information, especially within close-knit family groups.",
    " Title: Atlanta Police Officers Charged in Shooting Death of Rayshard Brooks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced the criminal charges against the officers involved in the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta. Former Atlanta Police Department Officer Garrett Rolfe, who fired the fatal shots, is being charged with felony murder, and former Officer Devin Brosnan, who was also present during the altercation, will be charged with aggravated assault.\n\nThe incident occurred on June 12, when officers engaged Rayshard Brooks, 27, who was asleep in the drive-thru of a Wendy's restaurant. The officers woke Brooks, instructed him to park the car in the Wendy's lot, and, after confirming he was not armed, conducted a pat-down search. Brooks was found to be over the legal limit following a breathalyzer test and a field sobriety test.\n\nBrooks cooperated up to this point but attempted to escape when the officers were putting him in handcuffs. A physical altercation ensued, during which both officers attempted to wrestle Brooks to the ground. Brosnan pulled out his Taser, which Brooks was able to take from his hand during the fight. Brooks escaped the officers and took off running with the Taser.\n\nRolfe pulled out his own stun gun and attempted to stun Brooks, but was apparently unsuccessful. Surveillance footage shows Brooks apparently pointing the Taser at the officers pursuing him, and three shots were fired, with Brooks being shot twice in the back.\n\nRolfe was fired from the department, and Brosnan was placed on administrative leave. Police Chief Erika Shields resigned from her position after 25 years of service with the department. The Wendy's restaurant, where the shooting occurred, was set on fire in subsequent protests.\n\nDuring the news conference, District Attorney Paul Howard described Brooks as \"calm\" and \"cordial\" during the conversation with officers before the shooting, and that he displayed a \"cooperative nature\" and \"almost jovial\" demeanor, despite being \"slightly impaired.\" Howard also stated that the officers' demeanor after the shooting, which included Rolfe kicking Brooks' body, did not reflect any fear or danger from Brooks, but rather \"other kinds of emotions.\"",

Yovanovitch, who was removed from her post in May, expressed shock and devastation during her testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nAdam Schiff, the committee's chairman, described the moment as \"dramatic,\" stating, \"This wasn\u2019t just testimony about the past, this played out in real time with the president attacking her.\" He further noted that Yovanovitch's testimony raised the possibility of witness intimidation as a new charge in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nDuring the hearing, Yovanovitch testified that Trump's tweet, in which he asserted that she had performed poorly during her career as a U.S. ambassador, was particularly unsettling. Trump's tweet, sent during Yovanovitch's public testimony, claimed that Yovanovitch's assignments had resulted in negative outcomes, citing her initial posting in Somalia and her service in Ukraine.\n\nThe impeachment proceedings are set to continue into the afternoon, with major broadcast networks and cable news channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News, C-SPAN, and PBS, pre-empting regular programming to cover the historic event.",
    " Title: Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan Holds Final Decision on $3.6 Billion for Border Wall, Vows to Protect Military Housing Funds\n\nArticle:\n\nActing Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan has stated that he will make the final call on $3.6 billion in military construction funds that President Trump wants to allocate for the construction of a border wall. Shanahan, who took over the position in January, expressed that he has significant discretion in the matter and is not required to use the funds.\n\nThe Pentagon chief, who has been thrust into a politically charged battle between border security and military spending, has not committed to providing the full $3.6 billion requested by the White House under the president's national emergency declaration. Upgrades to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, dock repairs at Pearl Harbor, and maintenance at other bases across the country and across all branches of the armed forces could have their funding slashed or eliminated entirely.\n\nWhite House officials aim to pull approximately $3.6 billion from a pool of roughly $21 billion in unspent military construction funds for the border wall. The remaining $4.4 billion needed for the border barriers will come from funds allocated last week under the bipartisan spending deal, military counternarcotics programs, and a Treasury Department forfeiture program.\n\nDefense Department officials, along with lawmakers of both parties, are resisting the idea of siphoning military construction funds. Shanahan has not committed to the $3.6 billion figure and stated that he needs to review all projects on the table. The Pentagon has a process in place to make decisions regarding the construction budget, and Shanahan emphasized that they do not want to \"fumble through\" the process.\n\nShanahan has already ruled out at least one area of the military construction budget: housing for troops and their families. When pressed on the matter, Shanahan offered strong assurances that housing for troops would be protected.\n\nOne project reportedly under consideration is a school at Fort Campbell. Lawmakers who support the president's proposed wall and emergency declaration argue that upgrades and operational costs for the school will ultimately be funded, with the students benefiting equally from a stronger border.\n\nSimilar projects, such as a child development center at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, are also reportedly under review. The money at issue comes from \"unobligated\" funds in defense budgets over the past five years, which have been designated for specific military projects but have yet to have contracts signed or construction or repairs initiated.\n\nWhile Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) defended the president's strategy, other Republicans argued that their party has spent the past two years fighting for more money for the military. Pulling money from the military budget, they said, would be a mistake and could hurt the readiness and training of American troops.\n\nWith the exception of Sen. Lindsey Graham, most Republicans seemed reluctant to defend pulling money from specific military projects even as they backed Mr. Trump's broader goal. The political implications of the situation remain to be seen, as Democrats are using the potential loss of military projects as a means to drive a wedge between the president and Republicans on Capitol Hill.",

The latest charges of anti-Semitism come amidst a divide within the party over support for Israel.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) stated, \"I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push allegiance to a foreign country,\" which some interpreted as a centuries-old smear against Israel supporters. This comment led to accusations of anti-Semitism from members of her own party.\n\nFormer Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-CT) commented, \"Words matter, and when people say words that are biased, bigoted, and hurtful to another group of Americans, they have to be condemned quickly.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives is yet to bring a resolution, aimed at addressing anti-Semitism on Capitol Hill, to the floor. The Democratic leadership had initially planned to do so on Wednesday, but the resolution has been delayed. The resolution is intended as a rebuke of Rep. Omar, who is facing another backlash over anti-Semitic tweets made last weekend.\n\nKayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for the Trump-Pence reelection campaign, criticized the recurring anti-Semitic remarks by lawmakers like Rep. Omar. McEnany stated, \"This is not a one-time thing for Ilhan Omar. There have been multiple remarks. Likewise, we have seen some comments that are similar from Rashida Tlaib and certainly those around her.\" McEnany suggested that Rep. Omar should be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) should take action.\n\nThere is clear dissension among the Democrats on whether Rep. Omar will be permitted to keep her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, questioned the need for continuous resolutions addressing the issue, stating, \"I'm not sure we need to continue to do this every single time.\"\n\nOmar, one of two Muslim women in Congress, has declined to apologize for the latest statement. A number of Republican leaders have waded into the controversy, with Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) stating, \"If they really are serious about addressing the problem, Nancy Pelosi has to remove her from the Foreign Affairs Committee.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also commented, \"It's unconscionable for any member of the United States Congress, any less a member of the foreign relations committee, to repeatedly traffic in base stereotypes.\"",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Shift in Political Stance on Income Inequality Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's recent advocacy for addressing income inequality has sparked controversy, with critics viewing his sudden change as disingenuous and insincere. Romney, who lost the 2012 presidential election to Barack Obama, has been criticized for his past statements and policies that were perceived as favoring the wealthy.\n\nIn a speech on Friday, Romney argued that President Obama's policies have worsened income inequality and increased poverty. He stated, \"Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty than ever before.\"\n\nHowever, Romney's critics point to his past statements and policies that were perceived as favoring the wealthy. During the 2012 campaign, Romney made comments such as \"corporations are people, my friend,\" and \"I like being able to fire people.\" He also infamously stated, \"I'm not concerned about the very poor.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who made income inequality the centerpiece of his 2013 mayoral campaign, was astounded by Romney's sudden shift. De Blasio stated, \"Doing it in such a ham-handed manner in what appears to be a deathbed conversion is a strange way to suddenly come out of the box with it, and I find it disingenuous, and I think a lot of other people will too.\"\n\nStephanie Cutter, Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager, stated, \"A message only works if it's authentic to the messenger. I'm not sure voters will trust that that's the case here.\"\n\nRomney's advisers have not returned requests for comment regarding the criticism or how he landed on making \"American people are struggling to make ends meet\" a centerpiece of his official unofficial return.\n\nDemocrats have been grappling with the issue of income inequality, with some progressives criticizing President Obama for not being sufficiently committed to addressing the issue. Progressives were upset with Obama for signing off on a change to the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill sought by banks, and for his nomination of Antonio Weiss, a Wall Street veteran, to a top Treasury Department job.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Obama will use his State of the Union address to promote his free community college plan and a series of tax changes that progressives are already embracing as an assault on the \"1 percent.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is widely expected to run for president in 2016, tweeted on Friday, \"Attacking financial reform is risky and wrong. Better for Congress to focus on jobs and wages for middle-class families.\"\n\nDe Blasio believes that Romney's shift towards income inequality shows that the issue has become a defining issue of the 2016 campaign. He stated, \"This is on the minds of more and more people around the country, because income inequality is basically the touchstone of what we're dealing with right now. It is very telling that a guy who's trying to find his way back to political relevance will grab onto it.\"\n\nDe Blasio also noted that Romney might be the biggest stretch among the Republicans who could have attached themselves to income inequality. He stated, \"It's a fascinating and disingenuous play. But at least it will cause people to talk more about the issues.\"",

Perry, a Republican, expressed his disapproval of the administration's handling of issues ranging from the death penalty to joblessness.\n\n Last week's botched execution in Oklahoma, which led to a temporary halt in the process in that state, did not necessarily warrant a nationwide pause, according to Perry. He emphasized that Texas, which has the highest number of executions in the nation with 273 people currently on Death Row, has a different approach to the death penalty compared to other states. Texas uses only one drug for lethal injection, whereas Oklahoma uses a combination of drugs.\n\n Perry commented on the botched Oklahoma case, stating, \"There is an appropriate way to deal with this, and, obviously, something went terribly wrong.\"\n\n Moving on to economic matters, Perry highlighted that Texas is not focusing on raising the minimum wage but rather on creating jobs with higher wages. He has been attracting employers from other states to Texas, with 95% of the jobs created in Texas being above minimum wage. Perry argued that the minimum wage discussion is irrelevant when there are no jobs available.\n\n Perry, who has been traveling the country, also touched upon the theme often repeated by Republicans that minimum-wage jobs are entry-level positions and not intended to support a family.\n\n Regarding his potential presidential run in 2016, Perry acknowledged the criticism of his 2012 campaign as a failure but expressed the belief that a person's character is more evident when they demonstrate their ability to perform well after a failure.",
    " Title: Democratic Party Faces Internal Divide on Political Identity as Obama's Second Term Concludes\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Barack Obama prepares for his second inauguration on Monday, the Democratic Party, which has largely concealed its internal divisions during his tenure due to his commanding popularity, is set to confront a central and unresolved question about its political identity. The question revolves around whether the party will adopt a center-left, Democratic Leadership Council (DLC)-inspired approach or return to a more populist, left-leaning stance that mirrors its electoral coalition.\n\nThe entitlement debate, particularly regarding potential Social Security or Medicare benefit cuts for deficit reduction, may provide an immediate answer to this question. \"In the short term, that's the flash point,\" said longtime Democratic consultant Paul Begala.\n\nAs moderate Republicans become increasingly scarce, and more centrists find a home in the Democratic coalition, the party must also reconcile its stance on a broader range of economic issues, including Wall Street regulation and public employees' rights. As the 2016 presidential race approaches, and potential candidates begin to maneuver, Democrats must decide whether they want to be identified primarily as the party of Rahm Emanuel or the party of Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"One of the challenges is how we continue to do the right thing while working with a wide coalition of people, both workers and business,\" said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFor decades, cultural issues divided Democrats internally as they grappled with Republican accusations of extremism on issues such as race, gender, and gay rights. However, due to Bill Clinton's influence and broader cultural shifts in the country, there is now a consensus among Democrats on social issues like abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and immigration reform. While there may be tensions within the party's ranks on Capitol Hill regarding gun control, there is a wide and deep consensus on the issue among the grassroots and in statehouses.\n\nThe shift in the party's identity is not so much due to Obama's policy choices as it is the rise of the Obama coalition\u2014a diverse group of youth, minorities, and women. It is unlikely that any serious Democratic White House contender in 2016 would not align with the party on such issues. The Republicans, on the other hand, are now grappling with internal divisions on cultural matters as they strive to appeal to a rapidly changing country.\n\n\"The center has moved,\" said veteran Democratic strategist Mandy Grunwald.\n\nThe divide within the Democratic Party primarily revolves around fiscal and class issues, between its populists and its elites, on how to appeal to a broad group of voters while maintaining its commitment to those in need. In essence, the challenge is to represent the interests of its affluent supporters in areas like McLean, Virginia, and Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, while staying true to middle-class backers in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and addressing the needs of the poor in Albuquerque and Philadelphia.\n\n\"The real struggle within the Democratic Party is where you stand on income inequality and whether the government needs to be a part of fixing that problem,\" said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \"The demographics that the Democratic Party must attract are the people who need responsive government.\"",
    " Title: Harvard University's Admissions Policies Under Scrutiny in Affirmative Action Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a federal court trial in Boston, Harvard University is defending its admissions policies against allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants. The case, brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), has revealed insights into the Ivy League school's admissions process for the approximately 1,600 students selected annually from about 40,000 applicants.\n\nJohn Hughes, a lawyer for SFFA, argued that admissions data from Harvard showed a pattern of bias against Asian-Americans, particularly in terms of \"personal ratings,\" a measure of abstract qualities such as leadership skills and friendliness. Hughes stated, \"That Asian-Americans get worse personal ratings year after year is pretty strong evidence that racial bias has crept into the system.\"\n\nHarvard's lawyers conceded that Asian-Americans, on average, received lower personal rating scores in recent years. However, they maintained that this was only one of many factors considered in admissions, and that Asian-Americans, on average, scored higher than other racial groups on some factors.\n\nSFFA's lawyers argued that the plaintiffs had narrowly focused on the personal score to find the \"Asian penalty\" they were seeking. Seth Waxman, one of Harvard's lawyers, countered this argument. The trial is expected to conclude with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs between December and March 2019.\n\nLegal experts have suggested that the case could reach the U.S. Supreme Court, potentially allowing the court's conservative majority to bar the use of affirmative action to help minority applicants gain admission to college. In previous rulings on affirmative action, which aims to offset historic patterns of racial discrimination, the Supreme Court has allowed colleges to consider race as one factor among others in assessing applicants.\n\nSFFA alleges that Harvard engaged in \"racial balancing,\" keeping Asian-American admissions at or under 20 percent annually in the years before SFFA sued in 2014. Harvard denies these allegations and claims its approach to promoting student body diversity is in line with Supreme Court precedent.\n\nEdward Blum, an activist involved in other cases challenging the use of race in college admissions, heads SFFA. The U.S. Justice Department launched a related investigation of Harvard after President Donald Trump took office last year, and has backed SFFA's case, stating that Harvard has not seriously considered race-neutral approaches to admissions.",
    " Title: Trump Admits Decision to Fire Comey Unrelated to Justice Department Recommendation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with NBC's Lester Holt, President Trump admitted that his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey was not based on the Justice Department's recommendation. Instead, Trump stated, \"It was set up a while ago.\"\n\nTrump criticized Comey, calling him a \"showboat\" and a \"grandstander.\" He cited the FBI's turmoil and the agency's perceived lack of recovery from its state a year ago. Trump also blamed Democrats for the Russia storyline, stating that the Russia investigation was a \"made-up story\" and an \"excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\"\n\nHowever, Trump denied asking Comey to halt the investigation and expressed a desire for it to be completed by a competent individual at the FBI. Trump maintained that there was no collusion between him, his campaign, and Russia.\n\nTrump fired Comey on Tuesday, citing his handling of the Clinton email investigation as the reason. The White House's official reasoning, based on a review by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, was that Comey had mishandled the Clinton email investigation. Vice President Pence has also asserted that Trump's dismissal of Comey was based on Rosenstein's recommendations.\n\nThe timing of Comey's firing has raised questions, as it comes as the FBI appears to be ramping up its investigation into Trump associates' ties to Russia. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Trump had been considering firing Comey since November.\n\nAt Thursday's White House press briefing, Huckabee Sanders said that Comey's testimony before Congress on May 3 was the \"last straw\" that led to Trump's decision. In that testimony, Comey stated that he was \"mildly nauseous\" to think that he may have influenced the election by coming forward days before the election to say that he was reopening the Clinton email investigation.\n\nTrump's admission that he called Comey to ask whether he was under FBI investigation has raised ethical questions. Trump also stated that Comey told him twice that he was not under investigation, once on the phone and once during a dinner that was \"arranged.\" Trump initially claimed that Comey had asked for the dinner to ask to stay on as FBI director, but this was later disputed.\n\nTrump also told Holt that he wants to find out if there was Russian meddling in the election and insisted that his campaign and Russia did not collude. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia meddled in the election, but Trump qualified Russia's involvement with \"if\" three times in the interview.\n\nThe White House claimed Wednesday that low morale at the FBI was a reason behind Comey's dismissal. However, this was disputed by acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who stated at a congressional hearing that Comey had the full confidence of the bureau.\n\nSince the election, Comey has publicly confirmed that there was an ongoing FBI investigation into Trump associates and collusion with Russia, and he disputed under oath the president's baseless claim that President Barack Obama ordered his team to be wiretapped.",
    " Title: Partial Government Shutdown Affects National Parks and Services, Volunteers Step In\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing partial government shutdown, now entering its second weekend with no signs of a compromise, has led to the closure of visitor centers and the absence of park rangers at Joshua Tree National Park in California. The park, known for its rock climbing and camping opportunities, remains open to visitors, but facilities are not being maintained by the National Park Service.\n\nJohn Lauretig, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Joshua Tree National Park, stated, \"The visitors centers are closed. All the bathrooms are still open, but they're not being maintained right now by the Park Service. So the local community has rallied together and started cleaning the bathrooms and restocking the toilet paper.\"\n\nAs the shutdown continues, volunteers are stepping in to maintain basic facilities, but concerns are growing about the long-term impact. Lauretig questioned, \"As the dumpsters fill up and the pit toilets fill up, what kinds of solutions can we make to solve those problems?\"\n\nThe effects of the shutdown have been minimal so far, with approximately 400,000 critical federal employees continuing to work without pay. However, the longer the shutdown persists, the more widespread the impact will be.\n\nJacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, stated, \"More things will be shutting down.\" She explained that some agencies had a little extra funding to continue operations until the end of the year, but that money is running out.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to halt operations at midnight on Friday, and the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will close their doors on January 2. The food stamps program (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) and the school lunch program are funded through January but could be affected if the shutdown continues beyond that point.\n\nWhite House economist Kevin Hassett predicted the shutdown would not cause lasting damage to the U.S. economy, but admitted it could cause a temporary increase in unemployment if hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain idle for several weeks.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare payments are still being made, as usual. However, applications for Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages could be delayed, and FEMA's decision to stop selling flood insurance during the shutdown caused concern in the housing market.\n\nIn response to pressure, FEMA backtracked late Friday and announced it would resume selling flood insurance during the shutdown. At Joshua Tree National Park, volunteers are maintaining basic facilities, but the absence of park rangers is a concern for preservationists. Lauretig stated, \"There are rare and unique artifacts up there that need to be protected by a fully-staffed National Park Service staff. My concern is right now those one-of-a-kind kind of things in the park are unprotected, unfortunately.\"",
    " Title: Republican Convention Discord: Grassroots Activists and Establishment Clash Over Party Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of Tropical Storm Isaac's approach, the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, has been marked by a series of disagreements and clashes between grassroots activists and the party establishment. Drew McKissick, a South Carolina delegate, commented that the postponement of the convention's activities provided an opportunity for everyone to voice their concerns.\n\nThe main point of contention is a proposed change in party rules that would give presidential nominees more control over the selection of convention delegates sent by the states. This change, if implemented, would reportedly hinder insurgent challenges like those faced by Mitt Romney during the primaries. A compromise was reached in closed-door talks between Romney aides and conservative activists, with one person involved stating that it would result in a \"warm and fuzzy\" convention.\n\nSupporters of Representative Ron Paul of Texas expressed frustration over what they perceived as efforts by Romney's aides and supporters to silence their voices in the convention hall. Representative Todd Akin, the Missouri Senate candidate who lost much of the party's support after his comments on \"legitimate\" rape and pregnancy, was also a topic of discussion, with some Tea Party activists arguing that the \"establishment\" wing of the party had abandoned him.\n\nThe extra day provided by the postponement was seen as beneficial by grassroots conservative activists, who used it to mobilize support for their efforts to quash the proposed rule change. A.J. Spiker, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party and a supporter of Paul during the primaries, stated, \"The leaders of the Republican Party have an obligation to protect grass-roots activists.\"\n\nThe upstart talk extended beyond the fight over the party's nominating procedures, with Herman Cain, a former presidential candidate, telling attendees at a Tea Party \"unity rally\" on Sunday night, \"There were some people who hoped you all wouldn't show up. Y'all fooled them!\"\n\nReince Priebus, the Republican national chairman, gaveled the convention to order and unveiled two national debt clocks, a symbolic barb at government spending under President Obama. However, a group of Ron Paul supporters staged a demonstration in the hall with signs that altered the convention's \"We Can Do Better\" theme to \"Ron Paul Can Do Better.\"\n\nJeremy McReynolds, a 25-year-old activist helping to organize Paul's delegates at the convention, stated, \"They want to make everyone think that we all are united behind Romney. That's not true.\" Saul Anuzis, a delegate from Michigan and a Romney supporter, urged those causing \"mischief\" to settle down and fall in line behind Romney for the good of the party.\n\nThe storm also posed a delicate challenge for President Obama, whose efforts to manage the response may have given him a moment to look presidential in Romney's absence, but were also fraught with the risk of appearing to take advantage of a natural disaster at a highly politicized moment. Convention planners stated they had no regrets about their decision to postpone Monday's activities, with any ripples of discord expected to be forgotten by Tuesday night when Ann Romney and Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey are set to speak.",
    " Title: Democrats' Potential Investigations into Trump Administration if They Win Control of Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nIf Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate in the November 6 elections, they are poised to launch numerous investigations into various aspects of President Donald Trump's presidency. These investigations could cover a wide range of topics, from Trump's long-elusive tax returns to possible business ties with Russia and conflicts of interest, according to congressional sources.\n\nWhile the sequencing and scope of these inquiries are still emerging, Democrats are clear about what is not on the agenda: impeachment of Trump, at least until the outcome of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections and possible Trump campaign collusion with Moscow.\n\nIf Democrats take control of the House, they would move quickly to obtain Trump's tax returns to look for business ties to Russia and possible conflicts with the Republican president, his family businesses, and U.S. government interests. They may also examine his handling of security clearances and possibly probe his revoking of security clearances from perceived political enemies and his granting of an interim security clearance to an aide who later resigned amid allegations of spousal abuse.\n\nDemocratic majorities in the House or Senate would bring more resources for investigations that could derail or delay Trump's agenda, but aides said Democrats will still aim for some bipartisan cooperation to avoid appearing overtly political ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in an interview, warned that Democratic probes could be reminiscent of the late 1990s when the public felt sorry for President Bill Clinton after his impeachment. \"It could end up not working well for them, at all,\" McConnell added.\n\nIf Democrats take the House, Representative Elijah Cummings, who is likely to be the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, would lead investigations. During Trump's presidency, Democrats on that committee have sought 64 subpoenas, which Republican committee members have denied. If Democrats win control of the House, those subpoenas would not suddenly be issued all at once, aides said. However, they offer a roadmap of Democrats' intentions.\n\nCummings would take a \"two-lane\" approach, examining Trump's businesses and potential conflicts of interests, while also probing \"day-to-day\" issues such as prescription drug pricing, voter suppression, and questions about citizenship added to the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nOther committees, such as the House Judiciary Committee, the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, would also conduct investigations. There is no plan for a special temporary committee, but Democratic leaders would coordinate investigative efforts with the heads of the committees. The committees would spend January organizing, with investigations cranking up as soon as February.\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee would use its authority to request Trump's tax returns from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The judiciary and intelligence committees could then use the returns to dig into whether Trump got anything of value from foreigners or had business ties to Russia.\n\nSenate Democrats have a list of Trump-related concerns that runs about 100 pages, according to a document seen by Reuters. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, has criticized the Republican-controlled Congress for abdicating its oversight duty and being complicit in some of the president's most egregious attacks on democratic institutions. Schiff has stated that Democrats must \"restore Congress as an equal branch and check the ambition of an imperial and erratic president.\"",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Blimp: Fact-Checking Claims of \"State-of-the-Art Spy Gadgets\" for Data Collection\n\nArticle:\n\nIn March, a post by America Web Media suggested that the Trump campaign might use \"state-of-the-art spy gadgets\" to collect data on American citizens through a campaign blimp. This claim, however, is not supported by factual evidence.\n\nInitially, the Trump campaign had planned to send a blimp emblazoned with the Trump-Pence logo over swing states from May to July, as reported by Politico, the Associated Press, Fox News, and other outlets in early March. The blimp was intended to serve a dual purpose: campaigning and collecting voter data.\n\nAccording to the March reports, the campaign planned to collect voter information through a message on the blimp encouraging those who see it to text the Trump campaign. The campaign would then be able to use the respondents' contact information for donation requests and to send election materials. The America Web Media article's claim of \"state-of-the-art spy gadgets\" for data collection is not mentioned in these reports.\n\nSince the initial round of reporting, the coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant change in campaigning, and it does not appear that the Trump blimp ever made it beyond the planning stage. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment, and there have been no reports of sightings of the blimp and the campaign has said nothing about it publicly.\n\nThe America Web Media article is incorrect in claiming that the Trump blimp would use \"state-of-the-art spy gadgets to gather data on the American people.\" The data collection, as reported in March, would have been entirely voluntary, with individuals choosing to text the campaign and provide their contact information. The aspects of the article that were correct at the time it was first published are, at this point, outdated.",
    " Title: Texas Democrats Face Challenges in \"Turn Texas Blue\" Campaign as Abortion Issue Divides Latino Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats in Texas are facing challenges in their efforts to \"turn Texas blue\" as the abortion issue divides Latino voters, a key demographic they are targeting to win over in the state. The Democrats are planning to spend millions of dollars to attract a new generation of Latino voters, but the ongoing abortion debate in Austin may not be an effective strategy for this group.\n\nThe abortion fight, which flared up this summer, was seen as an opportunity for Democrats to galvanize new supporters who might stay engaged for the long term. However, the issue is not as appealing to Latino voters, who oppose abortion more strongly than most other voting groups, according to polls.\n\nThe Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that 53% of Hispanic Catholics believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, a higher percentage than all other religious voting groups, including white Catholics, white mainline Protestants, black Protestants, and Jews. A poll by the Wilson Perkins Allen research firm also found a 2-1 \"pro-life\" margin among Texas Hispanic voters, with 62% describing themselves as pro-life and only 32% calling themselves pro-choice.\n\nSome Democratic strategists argue that the key to winning over Latinos is to avoid focusing too much on any one issue, especially abortion. Matt Angle, a longtime state strategist, suggests that the party's candidates should develop a broader pitch on a range of issues important to Latinos, but one powerful message is the \"overreach\" by imposing strict health and safety standards that lead to the closure of many health clinics in the state.\n\nDespite the challenges, most Texas Democrats do not think Latinos' anti-abortion views will sink their hopes. James Aldrete, an Austin-based consultant, argues that other polls show Latinos' opposition to abortion is softer than it appears, with 74% of Latinos believing women have the right to make their own decisions without interference from politicians, and a similar percentage saying they would not judge women who decide they are not ready to be parents.\n\nThe Democrats have not won a statewide race since 1994, lost control of the Legislature years ago, and President Barack Obama won only 41% of the vote in Texas in 2012. The party has also suffered a series of other humiliations, including Gene Kelly, a perennial candidate who shares the same name as the dancer, winning the nomination to the U.S. Senate. However, most Texas Democrats remain optimistic about their chances of winning over Latino voters.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Shifts Focus to Elizabeth Warren as She Gains Momentum in Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump campaign is adjusting its strategy to focus on Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been gaining momentum in the Democratic primary race. The shift comes as Warren's populist message and disciplined campaign style have raised concerns among Trump advisers about her potential threat in a general election.\n\nAccording to conversations with more than a half-dozen Trump advisers, the Trump campaign is now deploying opposition research, camera-wielding trackers, and preparing to brand Warren as a liberal extremist. This reassessment reflects the volatility of the Democratic primary and the Trump campaign's response to it.\n\nInitially, the Trump campaign had focused almost exclusively on former Vice President Joe Biden. However, Warren's rise in polls and her perceived ability to win over suburban female voters has prompted the Trump team to take notice. Campaign pollster John McLaughlin has expressed concern that Warren's attacks on Trump could undercut his support from working-class voters who propelled him to the presidency.\n\nIn a text message to a colleague, McLaughlin wrote, \"Sen. Warren's attacks on President Trump's policies need to be rebutted. We can't just allow her to continue to attack the President in key states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and elsewhere.\"\n\nBiden will still receive a significant share of the campaign's attention. However, Trump aides are less certain that he will be their eventual opponent. The reelection campaign first began taking note of Warren's momentum several weeks ago, when polling showed her gaining substantially on Biden and Sanders. They were startled earlier this month when Tucker Carlson, a host on Trump-friendly Fox News, praised Warren's populist economic agenda.\n\nOther pro-Trump Republican groups are also paying closer attention to Warren. The GOP oppo research shop America Rising has placed Warren in its top tier of Democratic candidates and will prioritize putting trackers on her campaign events. The RNC recently sent out a news release drawing attention to a radio interview in which Warren was pressed on her past claims of Native American ancestry.\n\nThe Trump campaign is preparing to dig into Warren's past as a professor and pick apart her laundry list of policy proposals. \"There's no question that Elizabeth Warren is on the move, has momentum, and could well end up as our opponent,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump 2020 spokesman. \"We have to make sure voters know about her proposals for government takeover of health care, free health care for illegal immigrants, radical environmental restrictions, and increased taxes\u2014all proposals that will devastate this country.\"\n\nA Warren spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWarren has been enjoying a renaissance after a painful campaign rollout. Trump attacked her mercilessly after she released a DNA test that attempted to put the controversy over her bloodlines to rest only to reveal she's between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American. In the most recent national poll, from Quinnipiac University, Warren was at 15 percent, only slightly behind Sanders for second place. And in polls released this week of California and Nevada\u2014two key states that vote in late February and early March, respectively\u2014Warren leapfrogged Sanders, running behind only Biden.\n\nThe latest view inside the Trump campaign is that Warren has a more coherent message and a more passionate liberal following than Biden, whose support they see as soft. \"Her politics are where the Democratic party has moved,\" said Trump campaign adviser Raj Shah. \"She's primed to pick up more support as Bernie fades and Biden erodes.\"\n\nBiden and his supporters, however, are confident the Democratic electorate is more centrist than prognosticators think. Not everyone agrees that going after Warren is the right move. Some Trump aides contend that her liberal positions would make her an easier general election opponent and that they should hold off on attacking her. Others, however, argue that guessing a particular candidate's level of electability is impossible and that the Democratic nominee\u2014no matter who it is\u2014needs to be defined well before next year's convention.",
    " Title: Obamacare Premiums Rise for 2015, but Consumers Have Wider Options and May Find Lower Costs\n\nArticle:\n\nPremiums for Obamacare health insurance plans are increasing for 2015, according to multiple experts. Avelere Health, an advisory firm, reports that consumers in the most popular 2014 plan, the cheapest silver tier plan, will pay an average of 10% more for the same policy next year. Pricewaterhouse Coopers, a consulting group, found an average increase of 5.2% when examining premiums for all tier levels by state.\n\nDan Mendelson, Avelere's CEO, attributes the initial pricing difficulties in 2014 to the exchanges not existing before this year, making it challenging for insurers to price their policies accurately. With a better understanding of the popularity of their offerings and the health status of their newly enrolled, insurers can set more precise premiums for 2015.\n\nHowever, the increase in premiums does not necessarily mean that consumers will pay more for coverage through the exchanges next year. With more insurers offering plans for 2015, most consumers will have a wider selection in terms of premiums, deductibles, doctor networks, and coverage options, experts said.\n\nIt is crucial that consumers browse through all the Obamacare plans available, especially those currently in Obamacare plans. If they do nothing before December 15, they will be automatically re-enrolled and may find themselves paying a lot more for coverage, even if cheaper policies were available.\n\nEven if their policy's premium does not increase, consumers could still experience sticker shock for 2015 if they received a subsidy. The subsidy is based on the price of a benchmark, which is the second-cheapest silver plan being offered in their area that year. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit health policy research firm, found that the benchmark plan will rise 2% on average.\n\nIf the benchmark plan in someone's area carries a lower premium for 2015, the subsidy levels are recalculated. Consumers who do not check out next year's offerings may find their subsidy for 2015 covers a smaller share of their premium, whatever plan they pick.\n\n\"Shopping around is an imperative this year,\" Mendelson said. \"In many cases, they'll be able to find a lower-cost option.\"",

The changes will not alter Facebook's data collection practices or its privacy policies.\n\nThe updates, announced on Wednesday, aim to provide users with a more straightforward approach to managing their privacy and security settings. Facebook also intends to offer users a simpler method to access and download the data the company collects on them.\n\nThese changes follow the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, obtained data on millions of Facebook users, including information from friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, despite those friends not providing explicit consent for data sharing. Facebook is also facing criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers, and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not disclosed the purpose or reason for using such data.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, stated in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in development for some time, but the recent events highlight their importance.\n\nFacebook plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but provided no further details. The company has attempted in the past to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain difficult to find and use for many people.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Facebook will consolidate privacy settings into a single, easily accessible location. The company will also provide \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work. Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, described the new settings as \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.\n\nTo comply with the GDPR, Facebook is adding a section called \"Access Your Information,\" a secure area for users to manage the data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments, and search history. This is where users can delete information or download a copy. While the download was already possible, it required some effort to execute. Cox stated that the changes allow users to browse their information in detail without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.\n\nCox noted that the changes align with the principles of GDPR, but there is \"a bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\" Facebook also plans to propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy, but provided no further details.",
    " Title: Disney's Strategic Shift: Launching Disney+ to Strengthen its Media Empire\n\nArticle:\n\nDisney, one of the most profitable media firms globally, has ventured into the digital-video service market with the launch of Disney+ on November 12th, 2019. The service, which faced initial technical glitches due to overwhelming demand, marks a significant strategic move for the company.\n\nThe decision to invest in Disney+ comes with substantial costs. Disney acquired BAMTech Media, a leading digital-video streaming platform, for approximately $3 billion. The company also spent $85 billion on the purchase of 21st Century Fox and attempted to buy Sky, a British TV giant, but lost out to Comcast. In the coming years, Disney will spend billions more on original series and films for its service, forgo around $4.5 billion in annual profit by withholding content licenses, and invest in new infrastructure.\n\nDespite these significant costs, Disney+ is priced competitively, with a monthly subscription fee of $7 (or less than $6 per month on an annual plan). This low price, compared to Netflix's most popular plan at $13 per month and HBO's service at $15, has led some to question Disney's faith in the offering or its ability to recoup its investment. However, Disney estimates it will break even at 60-90 million subscribers globally.\n\nTo attract subscribers and retain existing ones, Disney has implemented several strategies. It offers a three-year subscription for less than $4 per month, partnered with Verizon to provide Disney+ free to 17-18 million subscribers for at least a year, and has announced several other discounts and bundling deals.\n\nThe low price and strategic partnerships are tactical moves to compete in a crowded market. In the second quarter of 2020, NBCUniversal (owned by Comcast) will launch its own service, Peacock, while AT&T will release HBO Max, expected to have more than twice the programming budget of today's HBO. Other competitors, such as Jeffrey Katzenberg's Quibi, are also preparing to enter the market.\n\nBeyond short-term tactics, Disney's long-term ambition is to leverage data and direct customer relationships to fortify its entire media empire. For decades, Disney has thrived by cross-monetizing its divisions, but it has lacked a direct relationship with most consumers and their preferences. Through Disney+, the company aims to gather this data, inform decisions about content production, increase the efficacy of marketing and promotion, and sell more Disney-related products and experiences to fans.\n\nThis data-driven approach has led some analysts to compare Disney+ with Amazon's Prime Video rather than Netflix. The endgame in the streaming video-on-demand (SVOD) market isn't just video, but entire ecosystems that can generate revenue from various sources, such as theme park passes, cruises, and merchandise.",
    " Title: George Zimmerman Files Lawsuit Alleging Conspiracy in Trayvon Martin Case\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorge Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch captain who was acquitted in the 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, has filed a lawsuit in Florida alleging a conspiracy to frame him and seeking more than $100 million in damages. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, accuses civil rights attorney Ben Crump, Trayvon's parents, prosecutors, and state authorities of participating in a plot to swap out a reluctant witness and prepare a witness to deliver false testimony against Zimmerman.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Trayvon's parents, prosecutors, and state authorities went along with the alleged ruse, knowingly obstructing justice or lying under oath to cover up the witness fraud. The suit's chief allegation is that civil rights attorney Ben Crump helped to swap out Brittany Diamond Eugene, a witness who was reluctant to testify, for her half-sister, Rachel Jeantel.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Jeantel posed as Trayvon's girlfriend during the encounter with Zimmerman, while it was Eugene who was dating Trayvon and on the phone with him during the incident. Jeantel then delivered bogus testimony on the stand at Zimmerman's trial, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe plan was made final in a 3-minute phone call between Crump and Eugene on March 31, 2012, the lawsuit says. Jeantel, a key prosecution witness, testified that Trayvon told her in the phone call that someone was following him. As Trayvon neared the home of his father's girlfriend, he tried to lose Zimmerman, she testified. Jeantel said she heard him talking to Zimmerman in the background.\n\n\"He said, 'Why are you following me for?' And I heard a hard-breathing man say, 'What you doing around here?'\" Jeantel testified. Jeantel then heard a bump from Trayvon's headset hitting something and \"wet grass sounds.\" \"I start hearing a little bit of Trayvon saying, 'Get off, get off!'\" said Jeantel.\n\nJeantel admitted on the stand to lying several times to Trayvon's family about her age and about her reasons for not attending Trayvon's funeral. Jeantel found herself under the unforgiving light of a nationally televised trial. Viewers criticized her for her dress, her weight, and her speech and her combative manner on the stand.\n\nIn a statement issued on behalf of Trayvon's parents and Crump, the lawsuit was described as \"an unfounded and reckless lawsuit\" and a \"shameless attempt to profit off the lives and grief of others.\" The statement also accused Zimmerman of displaying a \"callous disregard for everyone but himself.\"\n\nCNN is reaching out to others accused in the lawsuit, including Jeantel, who did not immediately return a voicemail and text message seeking comment. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement declined to comment, and Attorney General Ashley Moody, through a spokeswoman, also declined to comment.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges malicious prosecution, abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and defamation. It seeks compensatory and actual damages of more than $100,000,000 and leaves open the possibility of an additional claim for punitive damages.\n\nA month after the February 2012 shooting, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee said Zimmerman was not charged because there were no grounds to disprove his version of the events. Zimmerman said he shot Trayvon in self-defense. Weeks later, amid widespread outrage, a special prosecutor charged Zimmerman with murder. A jury acquitted him of all charges in July 2013.\n\nZimmerman has been arrested in several alleged domestic incidents but not charged. In November 2013, he was arrested on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief accusations. But prosecutors said they would not press charges after his girlfriend said she wanted the case dropped. Zimmerman was arrested in January 2015 on the suspected aggravated assault of another girlfriend. Prosecutors did not press charges after the alleged victim backed off her claims. A year later, Zimmerman put the gun that killed Trayvon up for auction.\n\nTrayvon's death spurred a movement and helped give rise to the rallying cry that resonated with many: #BlackLivesMatter. The image of Trayvon wearing a hoodie was iconic. Professional athletes wore hoodies, and protesters repeated the mantra: \"I am Trayvon Martin\" to express solidarity and outrage.",
    " Title: Encouraging College Students to Study in Diverse Regions: A Proposed Solution for Overcoming Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nA college student at a socioeconomically diverse university has highlighted the consequences of the nation's political polarization, with 57% of fellow students coming from the top 20% of family income and predominantly from blue states. The student, who has yet to meet a publicly pro-Trump student on campus, argues that understanding the country's problems requires encountering diverse views and experiences.\n\nThe student suggests that national service programs, such as those proposed by politicians like Pete Buttigieg, could help bridge these divides. However, these programs would require a substantial budget and new bureaucracy.\n\nAn existing program, study abroad, is proposed as a potential solution. Over the past generation, the number of American college students studying abroad has increased significantly, with about 16% of those earning bachelor's degrees spending part of their time in college abroad.\n\nThe student argues that encouraging study \"at home\" rather than just study \"abroad\" could help students learn more about the United States. Programs that allow students to spend time at different universities in the U.S. do exist, but they are quite small. The student suggests that these programs should be scaled up significantly to ensure students learn about the diverse types of people and lifestyles that make America great.\n\nThe student proposes \"study in the U.S.\" programs as the foundation for other campus initiatives to encourage students to have difficult conversations and interactions in safe and civil settings. This would not only inject different ideas but also make colleges places where young people learn the skills needed to become informed and empathetic citizens in a diverse society.\n\nThe student, Isaac Rose-Berman, is a rising sophomore at Brandeis University and an intern at The Flip Side, a free daily newsletter that seeks to bridge the divide between Democrats and Republicans.",
    " Title: 2012 Election Marked as Most Expensive and Smallest in Modern History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 election, which concluded on Tuesday, has been labeled as the most expensive and smallest in modern history. The campaign, which began with the first Republican primary debate in 2011, was marked by a series of superlatives, including being the most expensive and, subjectively, the most garish and debased election of the modern era.\n\nMany commentators were captivated by the plot twists, despite their criticism of the campaign. Columnist Maureen Dowd described it as a race that \"looked more to the gutter than the stars,\" while Fred Barnes, in his final election column, titled \"Good Riddance.\"\n\nGary Hart, the Colorado Democrat who ran twice for president in the 1980s, in a recent interview, condemned a campaign marked by \"a dumbing down of the message to elementary rhetoric that does not contain big ideas or challenging ideas.\"\n\nThe core of these complaints lies in a paradox: the 2012 campaign seemed both bloated and all-pervasive, yet miniaturized and ephemeral. The arguments were small, with numerous days dominated by uproars over careless but inconsequential remarks by candidates. The debate often played out on cable TV and Twitter, shaping the contest in an unprecedented manner.\n\nThe playing field was small, with the Electoral College's usual bias in favor of 10 or so swing states intensified this time by the candidates' relentless focus on mobilizing narrow demographic slivers within those states. The leading actors were small, either content with their diminished stature or powerless to change it.\n\nBarack Obama, who four years ago encouraged people to view him as an epic figure, riding a wave of history, this time encouraged people to view him in life-size terms, as a mortal figure who had done the best he could amid setbacks and disappointments and was at least better than the alternative. Mitt Romney ran mainly as the vessel for anti-Obamaism, and watched helplessly as his biggest career achievements\u2014in business and as Massachusetts governor\u2014turned into partial liabilities.\n\nThese 2012 phenomena occurred due to three long-term trends that contributed to making this election historically small. One consistent refrain of Barack Obama, especially in the early days of his administration, was disdain for what he plainly regarded as the frivolous and distracting nature of modern political media and the 24-7 news cycle. In June 2009, Obama boasted to Brian Williams that he did not watch cable television, stating, \"I generally don't. Mainly because I don't find most of the cable chatter very persuasive. I've used this analogy before, it feels like WWF wrestling. Everyone's got their role to play.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Tweets and the Ongoing Russia Investigation: A Constitutional Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tweets over the weekend have reiterated his stance on the ongoing Russia investigation, specifically regarding the 2016 meeting in Trump Tower. In a tweet on August 5, 2018, Trump stated that the meeting was about gathering opposition research, contradicting previous statements that it was primarily about the issue of international adoptions.\n\nIn a separate tweet on August 1, Trump called for the investigation to end, labeling it a \"rigged witch hunt\" and accusing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being biased.\n\nDemocrats have labeled Trump's statements as obstruction of justice, but Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, has disputed this characterization. Sekulow stated that the theory of obstruction by tweet is \"absurd\" and that the question of obstruction would be addressed under Article II of the Constitution, which grants the president executive powers over the government.\n\nWhile Trump's lawyers have stated that the president is willing to sit down for an interview with the special counsel, they have advised against it, leaving the question of whether to subpoena the president unanswered. Sekulow has stated that a subpoena for live testimony from a president of the United States has never been tested in court and that they would prepare to handle it in court if it were issued.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has stated that the investigation should continue, as it is in the best interest of the president and the United States for all the truth to come out. Meanwhile, some Democrats have expressed support for impeachment if strong evidence of collusion were to emerge, but others have cautioned against invoking the \"I\" word prematurely.\n\nThe midterm elections in November are approaching, and some Democrats have discussed the possibility of impeachment if they win a majority in the House of Representatives. Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, has stated that if the grounds for impeachment are there, they should proceed. However, he has also emphasized that impeachment should not be the first order of business.",
    " Title: Former FBI Director James Comey Confirms Role in Leaking Memo Detailing Conversation with President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent testimony, former FBI Director James Comey admitted to orchestrating the leak of a memo detailing his conversation with President Trump, which included the president's request to drop the investigation into the former national security adviser. Comey made this information public through an intermediary after President Trump suggested on Twitter that there might be recordings of their discussions.\n\nComey, in his testimony, stated, \"I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, 'cause it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for our conversation; there might be a tape.' My judgment was I needed to get that out in the public square so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.\"\n\nThe New York Times published an article about the memo on May 16, and the story was also printed in the newspaper the following day. The article attributed the information to \"two people who read the memo\" without naming them.\n\nDuring questioning by Senator Susan Collins (Republican of Maine), Comey did not reveal the friend's name but confirmed that the individual is a professor at Columbia University. On Thursday, Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia, confirmed that he was the close friend who served as intermediary.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Injunctions on Travel Ban Executive Order\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States announced on Monday that it will review the lower court injunctions blocking the enforcement of President Donald Trump's executive order barring travel from six Muslim-majority countries. In a per curiam opinion, the Court partially stayed the injunctions blocking enforcement of executive order 13,780.\n\nThe Court's opinion grants the government's applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of section 2(c) of the executive order against foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. The injunctions entered by the lower courts in place with respect to respondents and those similarly situated, as specified in this opinion, remain in effect.\n\nThe Court's opinion states that the lower court injunctions, even accepting the First Amendment arguments against the order as likely to succeed, went too far. The injunctions also bar enforcement of section 2(c) against foreign nationals abroad who have no connection to the United States at all. Denying entry to such a foreign national does not burden any American party by reason of that party's relationship with the foreign national.\n\nThe opinion also announced the Court will consolidate the cases from the U.S. Courts of Appeal for the Ninth and Fourth circuit, Trump v. Hawaii and Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project, respectively. Both cases found the executive order unenforceable as a likely violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment Establishment Clause because the lower courts held it was motivated by an attempt to disfavor Islam.\n\nThe Court had requested additional briefing from the parties in both cases earlier this month, signaling they would hear arguments on the case despite the Court going out of its regular term this week. Arguments are expected to be heard when the Court reconvenes in October. Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center are expected to face off against a government team now led by acting Solicitor General Jeffery Wall.\n\nThe government had argued in the new briefing that the injunctions had delayed the start date for the 90-day order. This would allow the ban, which affects those coming from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, to remain valid despite having been issued in March.\n\nA dissent from the per curiam decision, written by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, would have gone further and stayed the injunctions in their entirety, allowing the travel ban to go fully into effect immediately.\n\nThe executive order was the second issued on the matter. The first, Executive Order 13,769, also included Iraq and was immediately the subject of challenges in the courts. The current order was tailored to address the concerns raised in these initial lawsuits but soon was itself enjoined in both the Fourth and Ninth Circuits. Finding a likelihood the plaintiffs would succeed on First Amendment grounds, these courts' decisions to enjoin the orders have heretofore prevented enforcement of the order.\n\nPrevailing arguments in the lower courts have controversially included those based on statements made by the president and his surrogates while on the campaign trail as to his motivation for issuing the ban.\n\nThe Trump administration has been determined to defend this version of the travel ban, setting up Monday's opinion and the potential for a Supreme Court hearing on the merits in the fall.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Challenges in Passing Budgets Amid Intra-Party Disputes and Medicare Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican leaders are facing difficulties in passing their budget proposals amid an increasingly polarized GOP, with disputes over defense spending and the pace of entitlement cuts. This development was highlighted on Thursday when GOP leaders announced a deal with top Democrats to scrap an 18-year-old tool designed to cut Medicare spending, drawing opposition from conservative groups.\n\nThe spending fights will make it challenging for House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to assemble a coalition capable of passing a budget. Democrats, who have criticized the twin GOP proposals as \"warmed-over stew,\" are unlikely to offer assistance.\n\nThe main sticking point is a dispute over defense spending. With Republicans in control of both chambers, defense hawks argue they must reverse years of cuts to the Pentagon to combat terrorism and maintain control of adversarial countries. However, this would require either politically difficult spending cuts or tax increases, or else the GOP will have to breach the spending caps imposed in a 2011 debt deal with President Obama.\n\nThe House Committee on the Budget approved its blueprint on a 22-13 party-line vote after a 24-hour period that underscored the defense rift. Budget Chairman Tom Price's budget cuts $5.5 trillion from spending over 10 years, overhauls Medicare into a voucher-like system, and makes steep cuts to welfare programs.\n\nThe Senate Republicans called the House's maneuver a gimmick, although they were not thrilled with their own plan, which included $58 billion in war funds for fiscal 2016 and maintained sequester caps in later years. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, said the plan \"fails to prioritize our national defense after years of damaging cuts to our nation's military.\"\n\nIn the House, members will debate whether to boost war spending to $96 billion without requiring $20 billion in offsetting savings. Congressional budgets are blueprints without the force of law, but they offer a comprehensive outline of each party's agenda as lawmakers forge actual spending bills.\n\nCoupled with the budget fight is a battle over updating an unpopular Medicare formula that controls payments to doctors. Lawmakers face an end-of-month deadline to avert a 21 percent cut to doctors' Medicare payments, as doctors may leave the program if the cuts are implemented.\n\nOn Thursday, congressional leaders said they have a framework for a replacement, which would give doctors a 0.5 percent pay raise each year for five years while streaming programs that evaluate their performance. The House and Senate will debate their budgets on the floor next week, and lawmakers will be soul-searching over whether they can support them.",
    " Title: Senate Efforts to Defund Obamacare Amidst Website Issues\n\nThe government-run Obamacare website, healthcare.gov, will temporarily shut down this weekend for maintenance, as it continues to experience technical difficulties. The site, which has been inundated with 8.6 million visitors since its launch, according to officials, has been plagued with issues that prevent users from viewing available health insurance plans.\n\nPresident Obama, in an interview with The Associated Press, asked for patience as the high volume of visitors has caused the website to malfunction. \"The website got overwhelmed by volume,\" he said, acknowledging the unexpected interest in the program. \"The insurance doesn't start until January. So they'll have plenty of time.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner criticized the decision to disable the enrollment site for maintenance, stating that the work demonstrates major flaws with Obamacare. \"The news that [the] enrollment system is already going offline confirms that the launch of the president's healthcare law has been an unmitigated disaster,\" Boehner said in a statement.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, have also expressed concerns about the website's functionality. \"A dysfunctional website is the least of that law's problems,\" Cantor said in a statement.\n\nInsurance agents have also reported difficulties using the troubled website to provide information to their customers. \"I am president of the National Association of Health Underwriters, and I could not get on the Web site,\" Thomas M. Harte, a New Hampshire insurance broker, told The New York Times.\n\nDespite the issues, enrollments have been increasing, according to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. \"We are pleased that enrollment for health care coverage through the new marketplaces is picking up,\" the association said in a statement. \"We expect enrollment to continue to increase.\"\n\nThe administration has promised significant improvements to the online consumer experience by Monday, but tech experts suggest that the website's problems extend beyond simple traffic overages. The Obama administration has been criticized for underestimating the level of interest in the program, leading to the website's design and coding issues.\n\nIn a statement, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius asked for understanding, comparing the website's issues to those experienced by Apple. However, critics argue that the comparison is misleading, as the site's functionality remains questionable.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Accuses Media of Lack of Journalistic Curiosity in Michael Flynn Case\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany criticized reporters on Friday for what she perceived as a lack of journalistic curiosity in the criminal case surrounding former national security advisor Michael Flynn. During a press briefing, CBS News Radio correspondent Steven Portnoy questioned McEnany about President Trump's recent comments suggesting that people \"should be jailed\" for the \"very obvious crime\" committed against Flynn.\n\nIn response to Portnoy's inquiry, McEnany referred to the alleged unmasking of Flynn by top Obama administration officials during the transition period between November 2016 and January 2017, a topic President Trump has labeled as \"Obamagate.\" When Portnoy asked for clarification on the nature of this alleged crime, McEnany expressed her appreciation for the question, stating that there has been a lack of media interest in this matter.\n\nMcEnany then outlined several actions taken by the Obama administration, including the Democratic National Committee-funded Steele dossier, its involvement in the FISA warrants granted to surveil former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, and the unmasking of Flynn. She also highlighted an Oval Office meeting that took place just days before Trump's inauguration, during which President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and acting Attorney General Sally Yates discussed the unmasking. McEnany emphasized that Yates \"learned\" about the unmasking from Obama and not from the Justice Department.\n\nMcEnany went on to detail the FBI's alleged strategy to \"get him to lie\" regarding Flynn and the criminal leak of his identity to the press in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. She expressed concern that these issues have been ignored by the media for an extended period.\n\nWhen Portnoy asked about the specific crime, McEnany reiterated that the leaking of Flynn's name to the press in January 2017 was the alleged crime.\n\nLater in the briefing, McEnany addressed the media's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, criticizing them for downplaying the virus when pressed on her past rhetoric. She listed instances of alleged mistruths by former officials, such as Andy McCabe leaking to The Wall Street Journal and lying about it, James Clapper lying before Congress, and John Brennan's statements regarding the Steele dossier and the Russia probe.\n\nPortnoy then asked if the individuals McEnany listed were the ones the president thought should be \"in jail,\" but McEnany pushed back, insisting that journalists should investigate the matters she had \"laid out.\" She concluded by stating, \"That is, after all, the job of reporters, to answer the very questions that I've laid out, and I hope you guys will take the time to do it.\"",
    " Title: Republican Establishment Criticizes Trump for Iraq War Remarks, Defends Bush Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent debate, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made statements that were largely factual, which led to a response from the Republican Party to criticize him. Trump's comments focused on the Iraq War and the Bush administration's role in the conflict.\n\nTrump stated that the Iraq War was a disaster, that the Bush administration misled the country into invading Iraq, and that the claim that Bush kept the country safe from terrorism is ridiculous because 9/11 happened on his watch.\n\nJeb Bush, a former governor and brother of the former president, responded by stating that while Trump was building a reality TV show, his brother was building a security apparatus to keep the country safe. Trump countered by reminding the audience that the World Trade Center came down during Bush's reign.\n\nMarco Rubio, another Republican candidate and Trump's primary rival, stepped in to support Bush, stating that it was not George W. Bush, but Bill Clinton who was to blame for 9/11, as he did not kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance.\n\nThe audience responded positively to Rubio's comments, but were displeased when Trump observed that Bush also had the chance to prevent 9/11 and did not listen to the advice of his CIA.\n\nIt is unclear whether this exchange helped or hurt Trump, but it did go badly for him in a way that was expected, as he went outside the boundaries of what is considered acceptable for a Republican Party politician to say. In response, the Republican Party and its backers piled on to criticize him.\n\nThe Republican Party is a coalition of like-minded people, and when a candidate steps outside their zone of comfort and says things they would not say, they team up to crush them. This is a common occurrence in primary politics, and it was on display in this debate.\n\nTrump's claims that the Bush administration positively knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is more dubious, but it is unquestionably true that the sort of WMD programs the White House said existed were not found and that the administration's public presentations of intelligence findings were highly skewed and selective.\n\nTrump's arguments are tame by his standards, and almost banal, as Republicans have wondered how he could be winning by claiming up was down. However, this was exactly how they won in their mid-aughts heyday, by slamming decorated war hero John Kerry for cowardice, claiming to have kept the country safe while presiding over the worst terrorist attack in American history, and responding by invading an unrelated country in order to dismantle a nuclear weapons program that did not exist.\n\nIn this debate, the Republican Party establishment finally got its groove back and handed Trump arguably his worst evening of the entire campaign. But they also proved to everyone else that pointing out that Bush was in office on 9/11 is a red line for the GOP establishment in a way that concocting a story about Jersey City Muslims celebrating the attacks was not.",
    " Title: North Korea's Denuclearization: A Matter of Interpretation Ahead of Summit Meetings\n\nArticle:\n\nAs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in prepare to meet next Friday, the topic of denuclearization remains the most ambiguous on the agenda. The term has been discussed extensively in recent weeks, yet there is little agreement on its definition, which could lead to complications during this week's summit and the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim.\n\nSouth Korean officials and Chinese state media have reported that Kim is open to discussing denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. On Thursday, President Moon announced that North Korea had not raised its long-standing demand for the withdrawal of US forces in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons, a concession that was met with skepticism by analysts.\n\nAdam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, stated, \"North Korea has been saying all the right things... they want this summit to occur and they're doing what it takes to make it happen.\" However, North Korean state media has yet to address the topic, and Kim's public statements have been vague.\n\nIn Beijing on March 27, Kim said, \"It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula, in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il,\" according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. This statement elicited a positive response from US President Donald Trump, who said there was now a \"good chance\" of denuclearization by North Korea.\n\nHowever, are Trump, Kim, and Moon discussing the same thing when it comes to North Korea giving up its nuclear capabilities? Over the past decade, denuclearization in North Korea has only ever meant one thing for the United States and South Korea: complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North Korean program.\n\nJosh Pollack, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, explained, \"It's called CVID\u2014complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of the North Korean program.\" This language has been used consistently by the United Nations Security Council in its resolutions condemning North Korea as far back as October 2006.\n\n\"Irreversible,\" in the practical sense, aims to ensure that current facilities cannot be reactivated after they've been dismantled, Pollack said. Any denuclearization deal would need to include a series of \"verifiable\" steps for dismantling North Korea's program, carried out under the eyes of independent observers.\n\nInspections could be conducted by an international body such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose inspectors were previously expelled by North Korea in 2002. For decades, the US and South Korea have pushed for denuclearization in North Korea. In 1991, Pyongyang joined Seoul in signing a \"joint declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" Two years later, North Korea pledged it would dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid.\n\nStill, the US government appears hopeful that the latest round of talks will be different. Trump on Wednesday offered a bullish view, insisting he's positioned to accomplish what his predecessors could not. However, he said he'd be willing to stand up and leave the highly anticipated summit should the meeting fall short of his expectations.\n\nOn South Korea's part, Moon denied on Thursday that there was any separation between what the North and the South meant by denuclearization. \"I do not think there is any difference in the concept,\" he said. When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promised talks on denuclearization in Beijing in March, according to Xinhua, he did not speak of Pyongyang ending its program. He spoke of \"denuclearization on the (Korean) Peninsula.\"\n\nExperts said Pyongyang has long been expected to push for the American military presence across the border to be part of the discussion, a position Pollack said he was not sure had changed despite the South Korean president's remarks. Although the US has not stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea since 1992, Pollack said North Korea considered the US's mere presence on the peninsula a nuclear threat.\n\n\"They really are threatened by superior American and South Korean military power; they need nuclear weapons to try and prevent an invasion in their view,\" Pollack said. \"They feel the need to equate their nuclear program with the (US and South Korean) military alliance and claim the military alliance is a nuclear threat, when there's no real grounds for that.\"\n\nExperts told CNN the confusion over how much each side was willing to give and what their basic goals were for the summits make a positive outcome harder to see. Adam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea at the University of Leeds in the UK, said the hopes of some officials in Washington that Kim would willingly give up his nuclear weapons program were \"utopian, really pie in the sky.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN in March, Cathcart said given the ongoing \"disdain\" the Trump administration had shown for the Iran deal reached during President Barack Obama's administration, it was hard to see a similar, incremental plan getting support in Washington. The deal removed many of the sanctions on the Iranian government, in exchange for the Middle East country getting rid of the majority of its weapons program and uranium\u2014a key ingredient for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe reality, argue analysts, is there simply too much distrust and too little understanding between the two sides to come to an agreement. \"They will affirm the principle of denuclearization as they did in 2005,\" said Pollack. \"And the implementation will be drawn up and never happen.\"",
    " Title: Tsarnaev Brothers Emerging as Suspects in 2011 Waltham Triple Murder\n\nArticle:\n\nForensic evidence may link the Tsarnaev brothers, Tamerlan, 26, and Dzhokhar, 19, to their possible involvement in a 2011 unsolved triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts. Since the brothers were identified as the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office has been investigating the possibility that Tamerlan was behind the fatal stabbings of Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken in Waltham.\n\nThe Middlesex County District Attorney's Office is now also looking into whether both Tamerlan and Dzhokhar committed the unsolved murders, according to ABC News, which reported that \"mounting evidence\" bolstered by \"forensic hits\" make the brothers strong suspects. The killings of Mess, Weissman, and Teken have remained unsolved since their gruesome murders on Sept. 11, 2011.\n\nAt the time, the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office believed the three men knew their killer or killers. Tamerlan identified Mess as his \"best friend\" to the owner of the martial arts gym where he and Mess worked out, according to the Boston Globe. Attention turned to Tamerlan after family and friends of the victims in the Waltham murders saw pictures of him after the bombings and recalled how he did not attend Mess' funeral and stopped making appearances at the gym, ABC News reports.\n\nThe three victims ordered food from Gerry's Italian Kitchen, but a deliverywoman heard no answer from inside the apartment when she rang the bell around 8:45 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2011. The restaurant drew the attention of authorities nine days after the Boston bombings after empty fireworks with the gunpowder taken out were found in a charity bin located in Gerry's parking lot, ABC News reports.\n\nResidents of Waltham and nearby Watertown, Massachusetts, told the network that they remember Tamerlan delivering food, and that he and his brother worked as pizza deliverymen. However, the restaurant denied that either brother worked for Gerry's.\n\nThe Middlesex County District Attorney's Office said late last month that it was looking into the possibility that Tamerlan was involved in the triple homicide. \"We are definitely going to pursue any new leads,\" spokeswoman Stephanie Guyotte said.\n\nNews that the Tsarnaev brothers are strong suspects in the Waltham triple murders comes the same day it was revealed Tamerlan was buried in Virginia. He died in a firefight with authorities on April 19, four days after the Boston bombings. His brother escaped but was captured later that same day by federal and state authorities in Watertown, where Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat in the backyard of a home.\n\nDzhokhar faces two terrorism-related charges in connection with the bombings, which killed three people. He has yet to be charged in the murder of MIT police officer Sean Collier, who was allegedly killed by the brothers shortly before the firefight with authorities on April 18.",
    " Title: FBI Director James Comey Testifies: Clinton's Email Practices \"Not Truthful,\" Putting National Secrets at Risk\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey stated that some of Hillary Clinton's claims, made under oath, about her use of a private email server were \"not true.\" This revelation has fueled Republican questions about whether Clinton may have committed a felony by lying under oath.\n\nDuring the wide-ranging hearing, Comey also asserted that Clinton's email practices put America's secrets at risk and her actions constituted the \"definition of carelessness.\" However, he defended the bureau's decision not to pursue charges, stating, \"We have no basis to conclude that [Clinton] lied to the FBI.\"\n\nRepublicans, such as Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), questioned Clinton's claims that she sent or received no classified material, and that she used only one device. In response to these claims, Comey stated, \"That's not true... There was classified material emailed,\" and \"She used multiple devices.\" He also noted that \"no, we found work-related emails, thousands that were not returned.\"\n\nDemocrats on the committee attempted to argue that Clinton may not have noticed or understood the classified markings in a few emails that bore them, bolstering any claim of plausible deniability. Comey did acknowledge that there is a question over whether Clinton was \"sophisticated enough\" to understand the significance of a particular classified marking at the time.\n\nFox News reported that a 2012 email containing a classified code known as a \"portion marking\" was sent to Clinton's account. During the hearing, Clinton herself was at her Washington home, as her campaign responded to hearing highlights.\n\nRepublicans, such as Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), suggested that Clinton had lied to the American people. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Rep. Gowdy both suggested a \"double standard\" was at play in the FBI's decision not to pursue charges.\n\nComey reiterated that \"no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case.\" He stated that while Clinton showed \"great carelessness,\" he did not see evidence that she and those with whom she corresponded \"knew when they did it they were doing something that was against the law.\"\n\nComey also denied a double standard was at play, stating that no one at the Department of Justice would have brought such a case against \"John Doe or Hillary Clinton\" based on the facts.\n\nDemocratic committee members criticized the hearing and described the criticism of Comey as political. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) stated, \"Amazingly, some Republicans who were praising you just days ago... in their eyes you had one job and one job only -- to prosecute Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nComey also addressed claims by Romanian hacker \"Guccifer\" that he breached Clinton's personal server. The hacker, Marcel Lehel Lazar, had told Fox News earlier this year that he easily accessed the server, but Comey stated that when questioned, Guccifer admitted he lied about the breach.\n\nToward the end of the hearing, Comey would not answer directly when asked whether the FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation. He also stated that Clinton gave individuals who were not cleared access to classified material, though a campaign spokesman countered that the attorneys who sorted through the emails had \"Top Secret-level clearance.\"\n\nThe hearing comes as Republicans turn up the pressure on both Comey and Clinton in the wake of the FBI's recommendation not to pursue charges in the email case. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has called for Comey to release all of the unclassified findings from the agency's investigation and for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to deny Clinton access to classified information \"for the duration of her candidacy for president.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been repeatedly hitting back at Republicans, with a top spokesman calling the bid to deny her access to classified information a \"stunt\" and the campaign stating that Republicans had voiced \"nothing but confidence\" in Comey before his announcement earlier this week.\n\nComey's decision, and the way he delivered it, infuriated Republicans who felt that the FBI director, in his unusually detailed and critical televised statement Tuesday, had laid out a sufficient basis for prosecution. In a stinging assessment of her email practices as secretary of state, Comey rebuked Clinton and her aides for being \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information. However, he also stated that there was no evidence anyone willfully or intentionally mishandled classified information.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Disagree on Obama's Surveillance Reform, Praise NSA Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional leaders have expressed differing opinions regarding President Obama's efforts to overhaul U.S. surveillance programs, with some criticizing the president for not going far enough to protect Americans' privacy, while others argue that certain aspects of the current system are necessary for national security.\n\nOn Sunday, the leaders of both the House and Senate intelligence committees pushed back against President Obama's assertion that the government should cede control of Americans' phone records. The president, under pressure to calm the controversy over government spying, suggested on Friday that bulk phone data should be stored outside the government to reduce the risk of abuse. However, Obama did not specify who should control the data, instead directing the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to find a solution within 60 days.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, expressed concern about the uncertainty created by the president's decision. \"We really needed a decision on Friday, and what we got was lots of uncertainty,\" Rogers told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" He added that this new level of uncertainty is already having an impact on the country's ability to protect Americans by finding terrorist threats.\n\nPresident Obama also announced that he will require a special judge's advance approval before intelligence agencies can examine someone's data and will force analysts to keep their searches closer to suspected terrorists or organizations. However, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed concern that this could hinder the program's ability to provide instantaneous information to disrupt potential terrorist plots.\n\nUnder the surveillance program, the NSA gathers phone numbers called and the length of conversations, but not the content of the calls. The NSA sometimes needs to tap those records to find people linked to suspected terrorists, according to Obama. However, he believes the bulk data should eventually be stored somewhere outside the government's hands. This could mean finding a way for phone companies to store the records, though some companies have balked at the idea, or it could mean creating a third-party entity to hold the records.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has proposed ending the NSA's bulk data collection program, putting him at odds with his fellow Democrat Feinstein on the issue. Leahy suggested to Fox News Sunday that the chamber will continue to look at legislation to make its own changes, and the final product will be impacted by Attorney General Eric Holder's testimony on January 29 before the Judiciary Committee.\n\nLeahy expressed concern that Americans have given up too much privacy in exchange for intelligence-gathering on terrorism. \"There's still going to be legislation on this,\" Leahy told Fox News Sunday. However, he suggested he might not fight the president on allowing the NSA's surveillance programs to continue, stating, \"I think we have a way that we could do this... But you still have to have some checks and balances, or you have a government that can run amok.\"",
    " Title: Seven Key Points to Watch in Stormy Daniels' Interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\"\n\nArticle:\n\nStormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who alleges an affair with President Donald Trump in 2006, is set to appear on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" this Sunday, raising questions about what she might reveal. The interview's contents remain a mystery, even to Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti. Here are seven key points to watch for in the interview:\n\n1. Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA) Details: Daniels has never publicly discussed the NDA that allegedly bars her from speaking about her alleged affair with Trump. The existence of such a document was confirmed in a lawsuit filed by Daniels earlier this month, which argues that it is invalid because it was never co-signed by Trump himself. It remains unclear whether Daniels will discuss the details of the agreement in the \"60 Minutes\" interview.\n\n2. Payment Discussion: Daniels has implied that she was paid $130,000 by Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about the alleged affair. Speaking openly about her claims would violate the terms of the disputed NDA, potentially subjecting Daniels to legal penalties.\n\n3. NDA Termination: There is speculation that Daniels could toss out the NDA completely in her \"60 Minutes\" interview, providing details about her alleged relationship with the president.\n\n4. Evidence of Affair: Avenatti has hinted that video or photographic evidence of Daniels' alleged affair with Trump exists. He has suggested that Daniels may have retained such material, potentially revealing it in the interview.\n\n5. Trump's Knowledge of Payment: The payment made by Cohen is a central point of contention. While Cohen has insisted that the money came from his personal funds and that Trump was never made aware of the transaction, Avenatti has argued otherwise.\n\n6. Motives for Speaking Now: Daniels' lawsuit claims she expressed interest in discussing the alleged affair publicly in 2016 after The Washington Post published a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump could be heard boasting about groping and kissing women without their permission. It remains unclear why Daniels chose to speak about the affair now.\n\n7. Legal Consequences: Trump's legal team has already signaled they are willing to fight Daniels on her claims. They reportedly asked for a temporary restraining order against her last month and have asked to transfer the lawsuit from California state court to a federal court in Los Angeles. The response of Trump and his lawyers to the interview after it airs will be closely watched.",
    " Title: Karl Rove's Remarks on Hillary Clinton's Health Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nKarl Rove, a prominent Republican strategist, has sparked controversy with his recent comments suggesting that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have suffered a brain injury. Clinton, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, had been hospitalized in December 2012 due to a blood clot following a fall.\n\nIn response to Rove's remarks, made at a conference last week, Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, stated, \"She works out every week, she's strong, she's doing great. As far as I can tell, she's in better shape than I am. She certainly seems to have more stamina now.\"\n\nRove, who is a Fox News Channel contributor, questioned Clinton's health during the conference, citing her wearing glasses after the incident, which are typically used for people with traumatic brain injuries. Clinton's health has been a topic of discussion since the 2012 incident, which prevented her from testifying before Congress about the Benghazi attack.\n\nClinton's spokesman, Nick Merrill, responded to Rove's comments, stating, \"Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there are no words for this level of lying. She is 100%.\"\n\nRove later defended his comments, stating that it is legitimate to question a potential presidential candidate's health. He clarified that he did not say Clinton had brain damage but had undergone a serious health episode in December 2012.\n\nClinton's health has been a recurring issue in her political career, with the 2012 incident not being the first time she dealt with blood clots. In 1998, while campaigning for Sen. Chuck Schumer, Clinton suffered a large blood clot behind her right knee and was hospitalized. In 2009, she fractured her right elbow after falling as Secretary of State and was treated at George Washington University Hospital.\n\nAge has often been a campaign issue, with both parties using it to their advantage. In the 1992 presidential race, Bill Clinton's campaign portrayed incumbent George H.W. Bush as old and out of touch. Then-President Ronald Reagan famously turned the issue on its head in 1984 by telling voters during a debate with challenger Walter Mondale that \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nFollowing Rove's appearance on Fox News, Merrill released a new statement, stating, \"From the moment this happened 17 months ago, the Right has politicized her health. First they accused her of faking it, now they've resorted to the other extreme -- and are flat out lying. Even this morning, Karl Rove is still all over the map and is continuing to get the facts wrong. But he does not care, because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, and he's succeeding.\"",
    " Title: Federal Court Rulings Threaten Trump's Healthcare Agenda, Leaving 2020 Election Outcome Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of recent court rulings, President Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \"Obamacare,\" have faced setbacks. Two federal judges in Washington, D.C. blocked parts of Trump's health care agenda, including work requirements for some low-income people on Medicaid and new small business health plans that do not provide full benefits required by the ACA.\n\nThe most significant case, a federal court ruling in Texas last December, declared the ACA unconstitutional and called for its complete dismantling. This ruling is currently on appeal. At the urging of the White House, the Justice Department has stated it will support the Texas judge's position and argue for the complete elimination of the ACA.\n\nHowever, the litigation process could take months, or even longer, to resolve, and there is no guarantee that Trump will achieve the desired outcomes before the 2020 election. Economist Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare under former Republican President George H.W. Bush, stated, \"Was this a good week for the Trump administration? No.\"\n\nThe ACA's dismantling could create significant challenges if it is struck down entirely. In such a scenario, Congress would face an arduous task of passing a comprehensive health overhaul to replace it, a task that both Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trump may not be able to agree on. The failed attempt to repeal \"Obamacare\" in 2017 proved to be toxic for congressional Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections, and they are unlikely to repeat the effort.\n\nThomas Barker, an attorney with the law firm Foley Hoag, who served as a top lawyer at the federal Health and Human Services department under former Republican President George W. Bush, stated, \"It seems to me that you can resolve this issue more narrowly than by striking down the ACA.\"\n\nThe Texas case against the ACA is expected to reach the Supreme Court. Trump has stated that the case \"probably ends up in the Supreme Court,\" and that the Republicans will \"end up being the party of health care.\" However, there is no sign that his administration has a comprehensive health care plan, and there does not seem to be a consensus among Republicans in Congress.\n\nIn addition to the Texas case, other health care cases are also facing challenges in lower courts. U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, ruled that the repeal of the ACA's fines for being uninsured knocked the constitutional foundation out from under the entire law. This ruling is being appealed by attorneys general from Democratic-led states to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., last week blocked Medicaid work requirements in Kentucky and Arkansas approved by the Trump administration. The judge questioned whether the requirements were compatible with Medicaid's central purpose of providing \"medical assistance\" to low-income people.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John D. Bates last week struck down the administration's health plans for small business and sole proprietors, which allowed less generous benefits than required by the ACA. Bates found that administration regulations creating the plans were \"clearly an end-run\" around the Obama health law and also ran afoul of other federal laws governing employee benefits.\n\nThe administration has stated it disagrees but has not formally announced an appeal. Other challenges facing the administration include regulations that bar federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions and a rule that allows employers with religious and moral objections to opt out of offering free birth control to women workers as a preventive care service.",
    " Title: Republican Gaetz Introduces Legislation to Deport Illegal Aliens During National Emergency Due to Communicable Disease\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Florida Representative Matt Gaetz has introduced legislation, titled the Protect American Nationals During Emergencies by Mitigating the Immigration Crisis Act (PANDEMIC Act), which would require the deportation of all illegal aliens under U.S. custody during a national emergency declared due to a communicable disease.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fox News on Wednesday, Gaetz stated, \"It is unconscionable that at a time when we should be working together as Americans, Democrats are working to socially engineer our country and advance their legislative priorities.\" He continued, \"The PANDEMIC Act puts Americans first by requiring that all illegal aliens be deported during a pandemic, ensuring our resources are used to benefit and protect American citizens.\"\n\nThe PANDEMIC Act is a response to legislation filed by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal, both Democrats, which called on federal immigration authorities to release detainees and stop targeting illegal aliens who are believed to not pose a substantial public safety risk.\n\nIn March, a group of House Democrats, led by Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, requested that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) freeze all deportations in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGaetz referenced the actions taken by the Mexican government, which has nearly repatriated all of the illegal aliens in its custody to prevent migrant detention centers from becoming hotbeds for outbreaks. He stated, \"I think we should love our country at least as much as Mexico loves theirs.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has scaled back its immigration enforcement efforts in some ways, with ICE announcing it would focus more on individuals who pose a greater public safety threat, and the agency has released hundreds of immigrants at risk of coronavirus complications. However, the administration has increased enforcement operations in other areas, such as closing the northern and southern borders off to all \"non-essential\" traffic, immediately turning back illegal entrants, and President Donald Trump has threatened visa sanctions on any country that refuses to accept deportees from the United States.",
    " Title: House Oversight Committee Accuses FBI of Stonewalling Investigation into IRS and Conservative Group\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's chief investigator, Rep. Darrell E. Issa, has accused the FBI of obstructing an inquiry into whether the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeted the conservative group True the Vote for special scrutiny. Rep. Jim Jordan, another member of the committee, is also involved in the investigation.\n\nThe committee has been investigating the IRS for six months, following an internal auditor's report in May that revealed the tax agency inappropriately targeted tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status. The IRS promised to clean up its operations, and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. ordered the FBI to open a criminal investigation.\n\nHowever, the FBI has not released any information about its investigation into the IRS, and has reportedly rescinded an offer for an in-person briefing with the assistant director in charge of the investigation. This reversal, after consulting with the Justice Department, suggests political meddling, according to Issa and Jordan.\n\nIn their letter to FBI Director James B. Comey Jr., Issa and Jordan warned that if they don't receive the information, they will use \"compulsory\" means. The FBI has declined to comment, stating it will respond in writing. The Justice Department has referred inquiries about its involvement to the FBI.\n\nCatherine Engelbrecht, an officer in the King Street Patriots, which was seeking status as a 501 (c) (4) social welfare organization, and True the Vote, which was seeking status as a 501 (c) (3) charity, has claimed that she and her husband faced an occupational safety investigation into their company, an IRS audit of their company, repeated rounds of IRS questions about True the Vote's activities, and six inquiries from the FBI about the King Street Patriots.\n\nTrue The Vote was granted nonprofit status this fall, but the King Street Patriots is still waiting. The group received another round of questions from the IRS in August, according to Cleta Mitchell, an attorney for True the Vote and counsel to the ActRight Legal Foundation.\n\nIssa and Jordan began pressing the FBI for information when former Director Robert S. Mueller III was unable to give any details, just days after Eric H. Holder Jr. assigned the FBI to investigate. The congressmen wanted to be kept in the loop as part of their oversight duties, and sent a letter in September asking for more information on the broad IRS investigation and why the FBI had been looking into True the Vote and the King Street Patriots.\n\nIn response, the FBI provided brief details about the broader IRS investigation, but did not mention Catherine Engelbrecht's situation. The FBI stated that Assistant Director Valeria Parlave, who oversees investigations opened by the Washington field office, was in charge, and had 11 special agents and one forensic accountant working for her. The documents Issa is seeking are part of the ongoing investigation and therefore \"can not be released at this time.\"\n\nIn a follow-up conversation with committee investigators last month, FBI official Monique Kelso again refused to provide documents but said she would make Ms. Parlave available for a briefing. When the investigators emailed to follow up, one of her colleagues, Kirk Melquist, said he had run the idea by the Justice Department and was awaiting guidance. In a follow-up conversation on November 20, Ms. Kelso rescinded the offer of a briefing.\n\nIssa and Jordan claim that Ms. Kelso denied getting pressure from the Justice Department, but Mr. Melquist wouldn't say one way or the other. The congressmen suggest that senior Department of Justice officials may have inappropriately interfered. They have sent copies of their latest letter to the two top senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee, urging them to give extra scrutiny to Peter Kadzik, one of the Justice Department officials Ms. Kelso informed of the committee's request for a briefing. Kadzik is up for a promotion within the Justice Department, and his nomination must pass Senate scrutiny.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown Negotiations Stall as Shutdown Enters Second Day\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first day of government shutdown negotiations has proven unproductive, with the U.S. Congress failing to make any significant progress in resolving the impasse. While President Trump met with some Republican lawmakers at the White House, discussions in Congress were largely stalled.\n\nThe House of Representatives convened and Speaker Paul D. Ryan immediately adjourned the chamber, preventing any floor action. The Senate held a session for over three hours, but the floor time was largely uneventful. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell concluded the session by announcing that lawmakers would be sent home for Christmas, signaling that the shutdown will persist until at least Thursday.\n\n\"It's really simple,\" McConnell said. \"Sixty votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and President Trump's signature. That's what we need.\" However, the two sides seem to be growing further apart rather than closer.\n\nPresident Trump canceled his plans to spend Christmas in Florida, and the first lady returned from her trip ahead of schedule. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer stated that Mr. Trump must abandon his border wall ambitions before Democrats will agree to reopen the government.\n\n\"If you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. Democrats believe the president, who has long threatened a government shutdown, will be held accountable by voters.\n\nMr. Trump, for his part, claimed there was a lot of \"fake news\" about the shutdown, but did not specify what aspects of the coverage he found objectionable. More than 25 percent of the government that is funded by discretionary spending has run out of funding, with the effects not being felt by most government workers until Wednesday due to the weekend and the upcoming Christmas holidays.\n\nApproximately 800,000 employees are in the departments and agencies that lost funding. Of these, 420,000 are considered essential and must continue working, although they will not be paid until the shutdown ends. The remaining 380,000 employees will be furloughed.\n\nThe Senate passed a bill on Friday to ensure that furloughed workers will still be paid for the time they were out of work. This legislation has not yet passed the House, although past major shutdowns have ended with workers being compensated for the time they did not work.\n\nThe primary point of contention in negotiations is President Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding. The White House had signaled earlier this week that the president would sign a bill without it, but he reversed his position on Thursday and threatened a veto unless he received the funding. Most Republicans have supported Mr. Trump, while Democrats appear almost unanimous in their opposition to him.",
    " Title: Conservative New York Times Columnist Bret Stephens Deactivates Twitter Account After George Washington University Professor's Comment\n\nArticle:\n\nConservative New York Times columnist Bret Stephens announced the deactivation of his Twitter account on Tuesday, following a comment made by a George Washington University professor, David Karpf. In an email to Karpf and the provost of George Washington University, Stephens expressed his displeasure over Karpf's tweet referring to him as a \"bedbug.\"\n\nThe email exchange followed reports of a bedbug outbreak in The New York Times' midtown Manhattan newsroom on Monday. In his email, Stephens wrote, \"Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about me, calling me a 'bedbug.' I'm often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people\u2014people they've never met\u2014on Twitter. I think you've set a new standard.\"\n\nStephens then invited Karpf to visit his home, meet his wife and children, and call him a \"bedbug\" to his face. He continued, \"That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part. I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say. Maybe it will make you feel better about yourself.\"\n\nKarpf shared the email on Twitter, which quickly went viral. In a subsequent tweet, Karpf remarked, \"It got 9 likes and 0 retweets. I did not @ him. He does not follow me. He is deeply offended that I called him a metaphorical bedbug.\"\n\nKarpf's tweet sharing the email received more than 8,000 retweets and over 52,000 likes.\n\nStephens, who is also an MSNBC contributor, later noted that the offer to Karpf to visit his home was a \"standing invitation\" and that the professor could also bring his spouse.\n\nThe New York Times' Stephens' response to the bedbug comment drew criticism on social media, with some users commenting that he was \"roasted\" for his reaction. One user wrote, \"Dish it out but can't take it.\" The specifics of the bedbug outbreak at The New York Times' newsroom were not immediately available.",
    " Title: President Obama's Strategy Amid Sequester: Public Engagement and Bipartisan Compromise\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's strategy to address the sequester, a series of automatic spending cuts, has entered a critical phase as the cuts have taken effect. The president now finds himself in an awkward position, advocating for the cuts' impact to be felt as he and his administration predicted, while also aiming to mitigate their real-world impact.\n\nThe sequester, a result of the seemingly endless budget wars, threatens to dominate Obama's second term. Before the cuts began, the president and his top aides were accused of stretching the truth about the impact of the cuts, fueling criticism that the nation can afford budget trims.\n\nThe president's strategy for restoring the latest cuts hinges on public engagement and pressure on Congress to reject cuts to government services. In a recent address, Obama stated, \"The question is, can the American people help persuade their members of Congress to do the right thing?\"\n\nIf the public pressure forces the GOP-led House to capitulate, Obama may yet win the war with tea party forces that have significantly influenced his presidency. If he loses this battle, however, he may face perpetual spending crises through the 2014 congressional elections, potentially leading to deeper spending cuts and the exclusion of new tax revenues.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Gene Sperling stated, \"My belief is that as this pain starts to gradually spread to communities affected by military spending, to children who need mental health services, to people who care about our border security, I believe that more Republican colleagues who are concerned about this harm to their constituents will choose bipartisan compromise on revenue-raising tax reform with serious entitlement reform.\"\n\nRepublicans face their own challenges regarding the sequester, both in substance and messaging. House Speaker John Boehner has expressed concerns about the sequester's impact on Defense spending, and today stated he was unsure whether it would \"hurt the economy or not.\"\n\nOther Republicans, including those aligned with the tea party, view the sequester as a step toward fiscal sanity. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) last week called the sequester \"a big victory\" for the GOP.\n\nThe one point Republicans are not willing to compromise on is taxes. This seems to close off avenues for compromise; any plan to replace the sequester, the president is saying, must include ridding the tax code of loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy.\n\nIn his Friday news conference, Obama admitted an extraordinary truth: that he lacks the direct powers to address the current state of affairs in Washington. \"What more do you think I should do?\" he asked reporters, not entirely rhetorically.\n\nThere are no easy answers to that question. With a policy in effect that was designed to be so awful as to force an alternative, all Obama and his critics can do is wait.",

Zhu, who claims the decision is a result of her conservative political views, shared a copy of the letter on her Twitter account.\n\nThe letter states that Zhu violated MWA's rules and conditions regarding good character, citing her refusal to try on a hijab in 2018, a tweet about black-on-black gun violence, and \"insensitive\" statistical tweets.\n\nIn 2018, Zhu reportedly refused to wear an Islamic headscarf during World Hijab Day at her college campus, stating that the hijab is used to oppress women in certain Muslim countries. Townhall.com reports that Zhu also tweeted, \"Did you know the majority of black deaths are caused by other blacks? Fix problems within your own community before blaming others.\"\n\nZhu defends the tweets, stating, \"I am so glad the story got brought into the public eye and the media because this is so much bigger than pageantry. This is about an organization discriminating against people with different opinions. Calling people racist when they\u2019re not. Little attacks like that really diminish the value and truth of the word racism.\"\n\nZhu argues that the situation is not just about beauty pageants but about an organization discriminating against individuals with differing opinions. She expressed her gratitude for the support she has received and stated, \"There should not just be diversity of skin color, there should be diversity of thought and of mindset, political affiliation, and I\u2019m so glad to be the voice of this right now.\"\n\nZhu said she was emotional when she first received the messages from MWA but is thankful for the support she has received. She added, \"I hope that other pageant organizations can really learn from this story and situation. Do not discriminate others based on opinions. I will still stand firm, stand my ground, and I\u2019m going to still continue to fight for what I believe in.\"",
    " Title: Climate Change and Typhoon Haiyan: A Closer Look at the Science and Reality\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Philippines, in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, has been grappling with the devastating effects of the storm. The country's representative to the United Nations expressed a heartfelt plea for action against climate change, stating, \"We can stop this madness. Right now, right here.\" However, the feasibility of implementing the measures to halt climate change, as desired, is a topic of debate.\n\nBjorn Lomborg, a Danish author and statistician, has repeatedly emphasized that the cost of implementing the proposed climate change mitigation strategies would be astronomical, potentially causing economic collapse and yielding marginal results at best. In other words, the financial burden of the desired programs is beyond the means of many nations.\n\nCurrently, carbon emissions in the United States are at 1994 levels, and emissions have decreased in most parts of the globe due to the economic downturn. Additionally, the global warming trend has stagnated for the past ten years, and some climate scientists predict it could remain paused for another 20 years. The future climate trajectory remains uncertain, making it challenging to attribute a single event, such as Typhoon Haiyan, to global warming.\n\nFurthermore, the occurrence of hurricanes and tornadoes has decreased significantly this year. As of Tuesday morning, no hurricanes had formed in 2023, and tornado activity in 2013 is at record low levels. Heatwaves are also fewer and milder than last year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The causes of these weather patterns are attributed to factors such as luck, shifts in the high-altitude jet stream, African winds, and dust.\n\nThe question arises as to whether human intervention can control local weather patterns, or if the influence of CO2 on weather events is being overstated. Given the ongoing debate about the settled state of climate science, it is essential to continue learning about our climate and its intricacies.\n\nIn conclusion, while the connection between a single trace gas like CO2 and extreme weather events like Typhoon Haiyan is a topic of ongoing research and debate, it is crucial to acknowledge the complexity of climate science and the need for continued study and understanding.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce Permanent Tax Cuts Legislation Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have announced legislation aimed at making permanent last year's tax cuts, a move intended to highlight the surging economy and the party's role in its growth before the November midterm elections. The three bills, collectively known as Tax Reform 2.0, would make permanent individual tax breaks, boost incentives for retirement savings, and provide more lenient tax treatment for startups and small businesses.\n\nThe legislation, if passed, would prevent individual tax breaks from expiring in eight years, while also increasing incentives for retirement savings and offering more favorable tax treatment to startups and small businesses. According to Rep. Kevin Brady, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the new system has led to significant job growth, larger paychecks, and a tax code that benefits families and American businesses.\n\nThe bills are expected to face a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, making them more of a political statement than a policy accomplishment. The lack of a budget to protect the legislation from the filibuster increases the likelihood of its failure in the Senate. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that the cuts would add at least $650 billion to the deficit over the next decade, with most of the savings benefiting wealthier Americans.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the tax reform, with Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on Ways and Means, stating that the first Republican tax law has not helped workers, as wages are not keeping pace with inflation, health insurance and prescription drug costs are rising, and companies are laying off workers and shipping jobs overseas.\n\nThe tax reform is one of the biggest legislative accomplishments of a Congress controlled by Republicans since President Trump took office. The party is counting on the tax cuts to persuade voters to keep them in power. A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found that 70 percent of respondents said the U.S. economy is \"excellent\" or \"good,\" matching the poll's record high.\n\nHowever, President Trump's approval rating stood at just 38 percent in the same poll, dragged down by perceptions of lack of honesty and leadership. Former President Barack Obama has also criticized Trump's handling of the economy, stating that the recovery started during his administration and that the job numbers are similar to those in 2015 and 2016.\n\nKevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has defended Trump's economic record, citing increased small-business optimism, business confidence, real sales, real private nonresidential fixed investment, and core capital goods orders and shipments since Trump took office. Despite these positive economic indicators, Trump's approval rating remains low, and he has faced criticism for his handling of various issues, including the economy.",
    " Title: Donald Trump's Management Style in the White House: A Mixed Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has adopted a management style in the White House that mirrors his approach to running his family business, characterized by a lack of rigid organization and a small, loyal staff. This style, however, has yielded mixed results, with the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the withdrawal of Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder from the confirmation process this week.\n\nTrump's business was known for its small staff, according to journalist David Cay Johnston, author of The Making of Donald Trump. \"And except for when he was in trouble with his bankers, he was the absolute ruler of his business empire, which is not at all how the White House works,\" Johnston says.\n\nThe president now presides over a vast federal bureaucracy that he and some of his Cabinet nominees are not familiar with. Trump has expressed frustration with the idea that presidential orders can be blocked by a federal judge and has upended longstanding foreign policy doctrine.\n\nDavid Cay Johnston describes Trump's approach as \"seat of the pants.\" He contends that Trump is not a great negotiator but is skilled at promoting the idea that he is. Trump gained fame as a businessman on the reality TV show The Apprentice.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration was tested when Flynn resigned after making false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Despite knowing about the false statements for more than 3 weeks before Flynn's resignation, spokesman Sean Spicer maintains that the president acted decisively.\n\nTrump seems comfortable with competing personalities and power centers in the White House, which can generate friction and palace intrigue. However, not everyone views this as a negative aspect. Chris Demuth, a veteran of the Reagan White House, suggests that such competition can lead to wiser decisions.\n\nDemuth, now a distinguished fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, notes that Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt deliberately pitted staff members against each other, often with creative results. He also shares the president's view that unpredictability is a good thing.\n\nHowever, unpredictability can also create uncertainty, making it difficult for the president to advance his agenda. \"Running government is no different than assembling an automobile, making a movie,\" says journalist Johnston, who launched the news site DCReport.org. \"There are lots of different parts that have to be brought together and coordinated with a knowledge of how do you achieve that. Trump does not have those skills.\"\n\nThe administration is less than one month old, and adjustments could still be made. After the botched rollout of the travel ban, for example, the White House chief of staff reportedly drew up a checklist to ensure future initiatives go through the proper channels. Trump, the improviser, often seems impatient with checklists. But as he once said on The Apprentice, it's important to adapt.\n\n\"Often times, things go wrong and there's just not much you can do about it,\" Trump said. \"But a really good leader will step up, take responsibility, and really just find the right solution.\" The question remains whether Trump himself can learn that lesson from his own political apprenticeship.",
    " Title: U.S. Abstains from U.N. Vote on Israel Settlements, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote on Friday, allowing a resolution condemning Israel's settlement expansion in the disputed West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to pass. The move has sparked controversy and criticism from U.S. Republicans and Jewish leaders worldwide.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry defended the Obama administration's decision, stating that the continued Israeli settlement building risks the \"two-state solution\" between Israelis and Palestinians, who also lay claim to the region. Kerry emphasized that the \"two-state solution\" is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors, and freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people.\n\nThe resolution, put forward by four nations, was initially withdrawn under pressure from Israel and the incoming Republican President Donald Trump. Trump expressed his disapproval of the move minutes after the vote, tweeting, \"Things will be different after Jan. 20.\"\n\nIsrael's Ambassador Danny Danon stated, \"It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blasted the administration for appearing to undermine America's historic Middle East ally.\n\nThe resolution was adopted with 14 votes in favor, after U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power abstained. It is the first resolution the Security Council has adopted on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years. The measure calls on Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activity in occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.\"\n\nAs one of the council's five permanent members, the U.S. has veto power and has used it to shield Israel from condemnatory resolutions. However, the Obama administration has long made clear its opposition to Israeli settlement-building in occupied territory, even though it provides Israel with tens of billions of dollars in assistance annually.\n\nAnne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, stated, \"The contention that settlements, and not Palestinian terrorism, is the obstacle to peace is false.\" Bayefsky argued that seven decades of violent Palestinian rejection of a Jewish state prove otherwise.",
    " Title: Pelosi Urges Boehner to Initiate Debate on Military Force Authorization for President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has called on Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to initiate a debate in Congress over granting President Barack Obama a new authorization to use military force to combat Islamic militants. During a breakfast with Bloomberg News reporters and editors in New York on Tuesday, Pelosi stated, \"Everybody in the country's talking about it except for us.\"\n\nThis month, Congress, in a rare bipartisan vote, passed Obama's plan to arm and train Syrian rebels. This authorization is set to expire in December during the post-election session of Congress. Speaker Boehner has stated that he is willing to call Congress back into session to vote on authorizing broader military action, but it is up to Obama to make the request.\n\nPelosi expressed her disapproval of waiting for the president to make a request, stating, \"No, if you want to have an authorization that has any constraints on the president, you don't wait for him to write it.\" The debate over the president's power to combat Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria is expected to create a divide in both parties and both chambers of Congress.\n\nDemocrats, led by Pelosi, strongly oppose using U.S. ground troops to fight Islamic State, while Republicans, particularly in the House, want a more robust response, including possible ground forces. Yesterday, Boehner stated that the U.S. will have \"no choice\" but to put American troops on the ground if other nations fail to do so.\n\nPelosi also expressed concern about a congressional debate over raising the nation's borrowing limit, which is set to expire as early as March. \"I'm very concerned about the debt ceiling because many Americans don't understand the importance of meeting the nation's borrowing obligations,\" said Pelosi.\n\nAlthough this election year is unlikely to yield many new seats for Democrats this year, Pelosi predicted that her party will win a majority in Congress in 2016.",
    " Title: Discontent with Obamacare Exchanges: High Prices and Technical Issues Deter Half of Users from Re-enrolling\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than half of households that utilized an Obamacare exchange last year have expressed their intention not to use the portal again during the upcoming sign-up period, according to a survey released Monday by Bankrate.com. This less-than-enthusiastic review for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is currently embroiled in another high-profile legal battle, comes less than two weeks before open enrollment resumes.\n\nThe survey found that about two in five people cited \"much higher prices for health plans\" on the exchanges this year as their primary concern. This was the most frequently cited issue among those surveyed.\n\nApproximately a quarter of respondents expressed concern that too many people remain uninsured despite the health care law's implementation, and 21 percent cited technological problems that affected the federal Obamacare website and some state-run exchanges during the initial enrollment period.\n\nDespite this gloomy assessment, more than half of those surveyed reported having a positive experience during the previous enrollment, while 43 percent reported a negative experience.\n\nThe Obama administration is aiming for the second round of enrollment, from November 15 to February 15, to continue reducing the nation's uninsured rate. To meet congressional scorekeepers' target of 13 million enrollees in 2015, they will need roughly 7 million existing enrollees to renew their plans and nearly 6 million new enrollees.\n\nThose who can afford coverage but fail to obtain it may be subject to a tax penalty unless they qualify for an exemption. If these individuals avoid the exchanges, it may be because they do not qualify for income-based subsidies and will shop in the off-exchange market.\n\nGerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told Bankrate.com, \"That's a reasonable alternative because the law regulates those so-called'mirror' policies to where there aren't significant differences. But I don't think there are any huge bargains there.\"\n\nEighteen states, on Monday, sought to protect Obamacare subsidies for those who qualify by opposing high-profile lawsuits that claim the subsidies should only flow to states that set up their own exchanges. In a brief to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, they wrote, \"There is no plausible reason to believe that Congress intended such a draconian result.\"\n\nOpponents of the ACA argue that the law reserved income-based credits for customers who use an exchange \"established by the state.\" They interpret this to mean the 16 exchanges set up by the states, and only those. However, the Obama administration contends that the law's framers intended the federal government to act as a stand-in for the states that did not want to run their own insurance portals.\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit is considering the case after a three-judge panel ruled against the administration earlier this year. On the same day, the Fourth Circuit ruled in favor of the administration, producing a split in the federal appeals courts. The Supreme Court is expected to decide in the coming days whether it will take up the Fourth Circuit case or wait to see if the D.C. Circuit sides with the administration, eliminating the circuit split and potentially reducing the need for high-court review.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Summit in California: Focus on Personal Relationship Sparks Skepticism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming summit between President Obama and China's new president, Xi Jinping, in southern California this weekend has sparked skepticism from some who question the importance of personal rapport between world leaders. The summit, which will take place at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, California, is expected to cover a broad range of topics, including military and corporate cybersecurity, North Korea, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and US-China trade.\n\nDespite the extensive agenda, some critics, such as Dean Cheng, a research fellow in Chinese political and security affairs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, remain unimpressed with the summit's emphasis on building a personal relationship between the two leaders. Cheng, who believes that personal dynamics matter little in defending national interests, anticipates little substance from the summit.\n\nHowever, the Friday and Saturday summit is built on the premise that the dynamics between leaders do matter, especially in the critical and rapidly evolving relationship between the United States and a rising China. Although Obama and Xi have met before, this will be the first summit between the two presidents, with Xi formally assuming China's presidency in March.\n\nThe informal and \"untested\" format of the summit was chosen to allow the two leaders to get to know each other and cover a broad agenda with as much candor as possible. This format is intended to lay the groundwork for US-China relations in the years ahead.\n\nSome China experts, such as Christopher Johnson, a senior adviser and the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, see the upside of trying out a new summit format with the Chinese, especially with a leader who has shown signs of being less rigid and more open to free-wheeling discussion than his predecessors.\n\nEven Chinese officials are cautious about expectations for the summit, with no deliverables, or specific agreements or formal steps forward, expected on the issues the two leaders will discuss. However, the Chinese were open to the less structured format with unusually copious time for unscripted dialogue, perhaps in part because Xi is anxious to demonstrate that a maturing China is ready for the \"new type of great power relationship\" that Xi is calling for the US and China to adopt.\n\nUS officials interpret Xi's desire to refashion US-China relations as recognition of the potential pitfalls the two countries face as China asserts itself on the world economic and security stages, and as the US reasserts its role in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nObama has said he intends to place a certain amount of emphasis on the cybersecurity issue, especially after the recent Pentagon-commissioned report that warned that Chinese hackers have accessed the designs for dozens of key US weapons systems. The two leaders will also discuss North Korea, with US officials describing Obama as particularly interested in probing recent signs of a growing Chinese willingness to challenge Pyongyang over its security provocations and funding schemes related to its nuclear program.\n\nThe US has recently had encouraging discussions with the Chinese on reining in North Korea, US officials say. They point out that these \"good discussions\" have taken place even as the two countries have aired their disagreements on cybersecurity issues. This ability to pursue encouraging and problematic discussions at the same time is evidence that the US-China relationship is evolving into something more open and developed, these officials say. It's also the kind of evidence that suggests that the two powers may be ready for the \"open and serious discussions\" Obama and Xi will at least have ample time for in Rancho Mirage.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Louisiana Abortion Law, Potentially Impacting Abortion Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to take up a Louisiana abortion case that could impact the state's abortion clinics and potentially reveal the court's stance on abortion rights in the midst of the 2020 presidential campaign. The justices will examine a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe court's new term begins on Monday, but arguments in the Louisiana case will not take place until the winter. A decision is likely to come by the end of June, four months before the presidential election.\n\nIn February, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Louisiana law from taking effect, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the court's four liberal justices to put it on hold. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who have shifted the court to the right, were among the four conservatives who would have allowed the law to take effect.\n\nThe Louisiana case and a separate appeal over an Indiana ultrasound requirement for women seeking an abortion, on which the court took no action Friday, were the most significant of hundreds of pending appeals the justices considered when they met in private on Tuesday.\n\nBoth cases involve the standard first laid out by the court in 1992 that while states can regulate abortion, they can't do things that place an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to an abortion. The regulations are distinct from other state laws making their way through court challenges that would ban abortions early in a pregnancy.\n\nLouisiana abortion providers and a district judge who initially heard the case said one or maybe two of the state's three abortion clinics would have to close under the new law. There would be at most two doctors who could meet its requirements, they said. However, the appeals court in New Orleans rejected those claims, doubting that any clinics would have to close and saying the doctors had not tried hard enough to establish relationships with local hospitals.\n\nIn January, the full appeals court voted 9-6 not to get involved in the case, setting up the Supreme Court appeal. The Hope Medical Group clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, and two doctors whose identities are not revealed said in their appeal that the justices should strike down the law without even holding arguments because the decision so clearly conflicts with the Texas ruling from 2016.\n\nThere was no action on a third abortion-related appeal that involves a challenge to a Chicago ordinance that stops protesters from getting within 8 feet (2.4 meters) of people entering abortion clinics and other health care facilities without their consent. Anti-abortion activists had challenged the Chicago law as a violation of their free speech rights. The federal appeals court in Chicago upheld the law, though grudgingly.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld a similar Colorado law in 2000, but in 2014 struck down a Massachusetts provision that set a fixed 35-foot (10.7-meter) buffer zone outside abortion clinics.\n\nAlso on Friday, the court agreed to hear an appeal by energy companies and the Trump administration asking the court to overturn an appeals court ruling and reinstate a permit to allow construction of a natural gas pipeline through two national forests, including parts of the Appalachian Trail. The 605-mile (970-kilometer) pipeline would begin in West Virginia and travel through parts of Virginia and North Carolina. The proposed route, which the administration had approved, would include the George Washington and Monongahela National Forests, as well as a right-of-way across the Appalachian Trail.",
    " Title: Primary Elections in Six States Highlighted Ahead of Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in six states will participate in primary elections, marking one of the most significant primary election days of the year. NPR's political editor, Charlie Mahtesian, provides a preview of the upcoming races.\n\nIn the closely watched primary race in Kentucky, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing a challenge from the right by political newcomer Matt Bevin. McConnell, who represents the Republican establishment, is matched against Bevin, a businessman. Kentucky is notable as the state where Rand Paul made a significant victory in 2010 with Tea Party support.\n\nSenator McConnell has raised $20 million for his campaign, but his approval ratings are not high. McConnell has run a focused and nearly flawless campaign, while Bevin, as a political newcomer, has made some rookie mistakes. Against a seasoned politician like Mitch McConnell, errors are difficult to overcome.\n\nIn addition to the Kentucky Senate race, the Georgia and Oregon Republican primaries are other significant Senate races to follow. The Georgia primary features a crowded Republican field, with Democrats expected to nominate Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former senator Sam Nunn, who is widely considered a top-notch candidate. In Oregon, the primary field is smaller, with two candidates: state representative Jason Conger, who went from homelessness to Harvard Law School, and pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby.\n\nRegarding House elections, incumbents have not yet faced significant challenges, with only a handful of states having held their primaries so far. By the end of June, when more than half of the states will have voted, a clearer picture may emerge.\n\nIn Idaho, an election is receiving attention for all the wrong reasons, with a contentious gubernatorial debate featuring two longshot, fringe candidates. The top candidates for governor, incumbent Governor Butch Otter and the state senator challenging him, are engaged in a competitive race, but their contest took a backseat during the debate.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at the Argument Against Aggregate Campaign Contribution Limits\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent contention, Mr. McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee (R.N.C.) argue that aggregate limits on campaign contributions violate the First Amendment by restricting a contributor's opportunity for political expression. However, this argument has been deemed unconvincing.\n\nTo illustrate the implausibility of Mr. McCutcheon's claim, consider his example of contributing $1,776 to each of 25 candidates, totaling $44,400, while being able to give $17.76 to every Republican Congressional candidate. This comparison is likened to developers of the One World Trade Center arguing that the First Amendment grants them the constitutional right to build to a specific height.\n\nThe R.N.C. and Mr. McCutcheon claim that they are not challenging all contribution limits but only aggregate limits. However, in practice, this distinction is considered insignificant. If the court were to strike down aggregate limits, a contributor could donate up to the maximum amount to every federal candidate and any political action committee (PAC) that contributes to a candidate. The number of PACs that might contribute to a particular candidate is not limited, potentially allowing for a significant increase in donations.\n\nFor instance, if there were 10,000 PACs, all likely to contribute to a specific candidate, Mr. McCutcheon could donate up to the maximum of $5,000 to each PAC, totaling $50 million. This would significantly undermine the longstanding, court-approved scheme of campaign contribution limits.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, in another context, described this argument as not a \"wolf in sheep's clothing,\" but rather a \"wolf that comes as a wolf.\" The Supreme Court's willingness to entertain this argument may indicate a desire to eliminate all limits on an individual's donations to a political candidate.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Steps Down as Secretary of State, Focuses on Empowerment of Women and Girls\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton, the former First Lady and current Secretary of State, has stepped down from her position on Friday, sparking speculation about her potential presidential run. In her tenure as Secretary of State, Clinton is reported to have expanded foreign policy to include the impact on regular people, with a particular focus on empowering women and girls.\n\nClinton has been credited for her efforts in fighting for education and inclusion in politics for women and girls. As Secretary of State, she is believed to have been the first to focus on empowering women and girls, creating the first Office of Global Women's Issues. This office has worked to highlight the plight of women around the world, including the rape of women as a weapon of war, and has fought for the education of girls in emerging countries.\n\nClinton also included the United States in the Trafficking in Persons report, an annual review of global efforts to eliminate human trafficking, a form of modern slavery that primarily affects women and girls. She stated, \"We believe it is important to keep the spotlight on ourselves. Human trafficking is not someone else's problem. Involuntary servitude is not something we can ignore or hope does not exist in our own communities.\"\n\nIn addition, Clinton created the Office of Global Partnerships, with a focus on empowering women, children, the poor, and the helpless. Her efforts have been marked by a balance of firmness and authority, poise and confidence, and goodwill when appropriate.\n\nClinton's tenure as Secretary of State is noteworthy for her focus on people rather than just treaties. She has been praised for her diplomatic skills, managing relations with heads of state and dealing with crises as if they were routine. Her legacy is not in the praise of diplomats or dictators, but in her focus on the suffering and aspirations of those affected by the treaties, made or unmade.\n\nAs Clinton steps down, the focus shifts to her potential presidential run. In the last century, five of the first eight presidents first served their predecessors as Secretary of State. However, it remains to be seen if Clinton will indeed run for president.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Constitutionality of Voting Rights Act Section 5\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark civil rights era law. The case, originating from Shelby County, Alabama, questions whether Congress overstepped its bounds when it reauthorized the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 2006, arguing that federal oversight of polling stations and election rules primarily in the former Confederacy is too broad and potentially discriminatory.\n\nSupporters of state and local election officials argue that the need for federal oversight should be reconsidered in light of President Obama's reelection, as he lost in most of the so-called Section 5 districts and states. The VRA has been used by the US Department of Justice to challenge new voter ID laws in states such as Texas and South Carolina, which were likened to Jim Crow-era \"poll taxes\" by Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe America that elected and reelected Barack Obama, according to Edward Blum of the Project on Fair Representation, the group that brought the Shelby County case, is far different than when the Voting Rights Act was first enacted in 1965. Blum stated, \"Congress unwisely reauthorized a bill that is stuck in a Jim Crow-era time warp.\"\n\nShelby County seeks to have Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act declared unconstitutional after the Justice Department nullified a local redistricting effort in Calera, Alabama, which attorneys argue played a role in the defeat of the sole black incumbent on the city council.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to review the case comes after hints earlier this year that some justices saw \"serious constitutional problems\" with the Voting Rights Act. In a 2009 case, conservative justices questioned whether the law had done its job so well that it now discriminated against Southern white people.\n\nOpponents of the VRA argue that the playing field is now even, and that it's no longer necessary to punish Southern jurisdictions for past sins. They claim that American people have shown at the polls that the playing field is now even, and that it's no longer necessary to target jurisdictions that were identified as discriminatory more than 40 years ago.\n\nThose defending the need for continued federal oversight cite statistics showing that minorities are less likely to have state identification required by new voter ID laws, thus putting an undue burden on specific groups. They also point to the zest with which Republican legislatures in the South focused on voter fraud ahead of the election, despite studies that show voter fraud is rare.\n\nThe future of key VRA enforcement provisions is at stake, with many legal experts believing that conservatives on the court are ready to rethink the law's future. The Supreme Court's decision on the case is expected in the coming months.",
    " Title: Slum-Dwellers in Ahmedabad Receive Eviction Notices Ahead of Trump's Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nSlum-dwellers in the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, have reportedly received eviction notices from municipal authorities as the state prepares to host US President Donald Trump on February 24. The eviction notices come as the area is being prepared for an event called \"Kem Chho Trump,\" which is similar to the \"Howdy Modi\" extravaganza organized for the Indian prime minister in Houston last September.\n\nTejabhai Meda, a 36-year-old laborer who earns approximately Rs 300 ( $ 4.2) per day, expressed shock at the eviction notices. He has lived in the slum for the past 22 years. \"I don't know what to do,\" Meda told a local news outlet. \"On one side, the government is saying it is helping poor people in constructing new homes, but here we are being evicted from a piece of land.\"\n\nMeda, along with 44 other families, was asked by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to leave the plot on Monday, but the municipal body has denied issuing such notices. AMC Commissioner Vijay Nehra stated, \"The news report is incorrect and misleading. In fact, it can be called mischievous as it tries to link the issue with 'Namaste Trump' event. There are no plans for any forceful evictions in the near future.\"\n\nHowever, an AMC official told the same news outlet that the slum dwellers were \"encroaching on government land.\" Kishore Varna, an AMC official, stated, \"We have asked them before as well to clear the site, but they refused, saying we should follow due process and give them notices. And when we issued notices now, everybody is linking the issue with Trump's visit.\"\n\nMina Jadhav, general secretary of Majdur Adhikar Manch, a trade union working for unorganized workers in Gujarat, linked the eviction to Trump's visit to Ahmedabad. \"The BJP government does not want the world to see that poverty exists in Gujarat. They want Trump and others to see only the big buildings, roads, and that everyone here has toilets and homes,\" she said.\n\n\"They (the government) want to hide the poor people living in slums, that is why it has sent the eviction notices to these families and built a wall to shield Trump from noticing another slum,\" Jadhav added.\n\nThe authorities in Ahmedabad expect to spend 800 to 850 million Indian rupees (approximately $11-12 million) on preparations for Trump's visit, according to Reuters, which reported the information from officials. Trump's visit provides him with an opportunity to woo hundreds of thousands of Indian-American voters ahead of the US presidential election in November. Trump is also expected to visit the humble abode of India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi in Ahmedabad.",
    " Title: Connecticut Gun Seizure Law: A Response to Workplace Shooting Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early hours of March 6, 1998, a tragic incident occurred at the Connecticut State Lottery headquarters, where shooter Matthew Beck took the lives of several coworkers before taking his own life in the parking lot upon the arrival of law enforcement. The event prompted a state representative, Mike Lawlor, who later became the Connecticut governor's criminal justice adviser, to investigate the circumstances that led to the rampage.\n\nLawlor discovered that Beck had a history of suicide attempts and gun ownership. This revelation led to the realization that there was a lack of a procedure for police to intervene in volatile situations, even when warning signs were present. In response, Lawlor and his colleagues enacted a law a year later, known as Connecticut General Statutes Sec. 29-38c, which allows police to seize firearms from individuals who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others, even if no law has been broken.\n\nThe law, which went into effect in 1999, allows for a year-long gun seizure and a mental health evaluation. One of the first individuals to have their firearms seized under this law was Bernard Krzynowek, whose sister reported him to the police during an argument. The police warrant states that Krzynowek's sister claimed he was in possession of guns and \"was going to kill her and other relatives.\" The police seized 39 guns from Krzynowek, who kept the guns for sport, hunting, and protection.\n\nAttorney Rachel Baird, who has represented about a dozen people who had their firearms taken under the gun seizure law, believes none of her clients presented any danger. Baird argues that the law, as written, strikes a balance between second amendment rights and community protection, but notes that police and judges sometimes err on the side of caution.\n\nIn the first 10 years after its enactment, more than 2,000 guns were seized under the law, with the majority of complaints coming from spouses. Lawlor is not suggesting the law could have prevented the shootings in Newtown, but he believes it has prevented other crimes.\n\nCriminologist James Alan Fox from Northeastern University states that gun laws are not a guarantee against gun violence. Fox suggests that efforts should also be made to connect with isolated individuals, not just to take their guns away, but to help them.\n\nSince the shooting in Newtown, more people in Connecticut have been reaching out to state agencies, expressing concern about others who may have guns. The Connecticut gun seizure law serves as a response to workplace shootings and other potential acts of violence, aiming to protect individuals and communities while balancing the rights of gun owners.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Support Grows for FASTER Act Addressing Food Allergies in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nBipartisan support for the FASTER (Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research) Act, introduced by Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) in April, has gained significant ground in Congress. The Act aims to address the food allergy epidemic, which affects approximately 10% of the U.S. population, or 32 million Americans.\n\nSince July, the FASTER Act has seen a 115% increase in congressional support, with 44 co-sponsors. This week, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers, fully endorsed the legislation. The caucus is co-chaired by Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Tom Reed (R-N.Y.).\n\nEvery three minutes, a food allergy reaction sends another American to the emergency room. A recent study supported by Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) suggests this statistic is increasing, with medical claims for food-allergy induced anaphylaxis having increased nearly 400% nationwide since 2009.\n\nThe FASTER Act aims to combat this trend by enabling major research and data collection initiatives that pave the way for new therapies, treatments, and, eventually, a cure. FARE has been working tirelessly over the last year and a half on legislator education, policy refinement, and advocacy.\n\nThe Act also addresses the issue of sesame as an allergen, through more stringent labeling and disclosure requirements. A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found that more than 1.5 million Americans are allergic to sesame, a figure five times higher than the previous estimate. Despite its prevalence, sesame is not currently regulated by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA), the primary federal law governing how allergens are represented on packaged foods. The FASTER Act would require sesame to be clearly listed on food package labels, addressing this dangerous problem and others.\n\nFARE supports the FASTER Act because it aligns with their mission to improve the quality of life and the health of individuals with food allergies and to provide them hope through the promise of new treatments.\n\nWhile the growing support for this legislation is a step in the right direction, the work is not done. I encourage all Americans to visit the FARE website to learn more about the food allergy epidemic and to write a letter to their representative to co-sponsor the FASTER Act. I also urge our congressional leaders to sign on to support this important legislation if they have not already. Passage of the FASTER Act is not ordinary legislation; it is hope for the entire food allergy community that groundbreaking treatments are out there and, eventually, a cure.\n\nLisa Gable is the Chief Executive Officer of FARE, the world's leading food allergy advocacy organization and the largest private funder of food allergy research.",
    " Title: Media's Role in the Covington Catholic Controversy: A Call for Caution in Social Media Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Covington Catholic controversy, involving a group of high school students wearing MAGA hats and their interaction with a Native American elder, has sparked a heated debate, with many questioning the initial reporting by The Washington Post and subsequent social media reactions.\n\nThe Washington Post's initial report, published on Saturday, portrayed the students as surrounding and taunting the Native American elder. However, subsequent investigations and videos have revealed a more complex series of events. The story has since unraveled, with many questioning the one-sided account provided by The Washington Post.\n\nThe controversy, fueled by social media, has led to a call for caution in news reporting, particularly on platforms like Twitter. The rapid spread of information, often devoid of context and fact-checking, has been criticized for contributing to the initial mischaracterization of the events.\n\nTwitter, in particular, has been singled out as a significant factor in the media debacle. The platform's real-time nature and the ease with which information can be shared have been cited as contributing factors to the spread of misinformation and the rapid formation of public opinion.\n\nCritics argue that Twitter's design encourages snap judgments, viral groupthink, and outrage, often leading to the amplification of the worst aspects of human nature. The platform's role in shaping public opinion and the potential harm it can cause has led some to call for a dramatic reduction in its use by the media.\n\nWhile the human tendency towards mob mentality and the spread of misinformation is not new, the ease with which it can occur on social media platforms like Twitter has raised concerns. The Covington Catholic controversy serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of relying on social media for news and information.\n\nIn conclusion, the Covington Catholic controversy highlights the need for caution and fact-checking in social media reporting. The rapid spread of information, often devoid of context and fact-checking, can lead to misinformation and the rapid formation of public opinion. The role of Twitter in shaping public opinion and the potential harm it can cause has led some to call for a dramatic reduction in its use by the media.",
    " Title: Michelle Obama's Unconventional Approach and Future Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nMichelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United States, has been known for her candid and unconventional approach to public life. During her time at the University of Chicago, she criticized the institution for its perceived isolation from the black South Side community, an area where she grew up.\n\nIn her career, Mrs. Obama's ability to discuss difficult and sensitive issues, such as medical trials on poor black Chicagoans, was one of her strengths. She often defied societal expectations, as seen in her 2004 interview with The Chicago Tribune, where she criticized the traditional order of priorities for men and women.\n\nDuring her husband's presidential campaign, she spoke out about the importance of communication and reconciliation, urging women to mend broken relationships. In 2007, she addressed a mostly female crowd in South Carolina, encouraging them to reconcile with women in their lives who had been estranged due to various reasons.\n\nAs she prepares to leave the White House, Mrs. Obama is reportedly focusing on wrapping up her eight years in office as smoothly as possible. At 53 years old, she aims to reevaluate her life after her tenure as First Lady.\n\nAccording to longtime aides to the Obamas, Michelle Obama is still determining her public persona post-White House. They suggest that she may follow in the footsteps of Laura Bush, known for her restrained approach, as a means of preserving her popularity and authority.\n\nMrs. Obama has expressed a desire to step away from the public eye, as it was for Mrs. Bush after her time in the White House. Leaving the spotlight could provide relief, as it allowed Mrs. Bush to simply be after years of hypervigilance.\n\nGiven the potential for backlash, especially from prominent Trump supporters, some argue that Mrs. Obama may choose to maintain a calibrated tone to avoid jeopardizing what she has worked to build. Her subtle methods of conveying her viewpoint, such as hints, invitations, art, and clothing, have been effective in the past, and her beliefs have been clear without directly addressing controversial topics.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Temporarily Halts Same-sex Marriage in Idaho, Allows Nevada Marriages to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy temporarily halted a federal appeals court ruling that voided same-sex marriage bans in Nevada and Idaho on Wednesday. However, hours later, Kennedy narrowed the stay to the Idaho cases, effectively allowing same-sex marriages to proceed in Nevada.\n\nActing on an emergency application from Idaho officials, Kennedy issued a one-page order Wednesday morning, staying the ruling by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which was released Tuesday. Kennedy's order offered no rationale for the stay but instructed those challenging the gay-marriage bans to file a response by Thursday afternoon to Idaho's request.\n\nBefore Kennedy acted, it appeared the new 9th Circuit decision would bring the number of states recognizing same-sex marriage to 32 in short order and to 35 if the courts applied the ruling in three other 9th Circuit states that have not permitted gay marriage: Arizona, Alaska, and Montana. However, in the wake of the second order from Kennedy on Wednesday, it appeared that the tally of states allowing same-sex marriage would instead rise to 31.\n\nThe second order, which provided no rationale, came after a Nevada group involved in the legal battle there, the Coalition for Protection of Marriage, filed an application asking to have the effect of the 9th Circuit's ruling in Nevada halted (or re-halted). There was no immediate action on that request.\n\nThis post has been updated with details of Kennedy's second order and the new application from the Nevada same-sex marriage opponents.",
    " Title: Christine Blasey Ford Agrees to Testify Before Senate Panel, Lawyers Say\n\nArticle:\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, her attorneys said Saturday. Bipartisan negotiators have tentatively agreed to work toward a Thursday hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee with Kavanaugh and Ford, but talks continue on a final agreement, according to multiple congressional sources.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, gave Ford a deadline of 2:30 p.m. on Saturday to decide whether she would testify before the panel next week. If she did not comply, the committee would go ahead with a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Monday.\n\nIn an email to the committee, lawyers for Ford said that while she has agreed to \"provide first-hand knowledge of Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct,\" they are disappointed \"with the leaks and bullying that have tainted the process.\" The timing and terms of the hearing are still unclear, as negotiations continue between Ford's attorneys and the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a letter, Ford's lawyers said they were \"hopeful that we can reach agreement on details.\"\n\nThe email also indicated that Michael R. Bromwich, former inspector general of the Justice Department, has joined Ford's team of lawyers. Bromwich currently represents former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired earlier this year.\n\nFord alleges Kavanaugh groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothes during a house party in Bethesda, Md., in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation and said he would appear before the committee next week.\n\n\"Brett Kavanaugh has been clear from the beginning\u2014he categorically and unequivocally denies this allegation and is eager to testify publicly to defend his integrity and clear his good name,\" White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \"On Monday, Brett Kavanaugh met with Committee counsels to answer questions subject to criminal penalties and offered to testify publicly Tuesday morning. Since then, we have heard about different dates, conditions, and ever-changing schedules, but today we appear no closer to a fair hearing. But one thing has remained consistent: Brett Kavanaugh remains ready, willing, and eager to testify as soon as possible.\"\n\nPolitics: Sen. Grassley Gives Kavanaugh Accuser More Time To Consider Options\nAs the Saturday deadline approached, NBC News reported that Garrett Ventry, a communications aide on the Senate Judiciary Committee who had been helping lead the response to Ford's claim against Kavanaugh, was stepping down after evidence surfaced that he was fired from a previous job partly because of sexual harassment allegations against him. Ventry denied any past \"allegations of misconduct,\" according to NBC News. He told The Washington Post that he resigned \"in order to not be a distraction\" as Republicans in the Senate continue to work on getting Kavanaugh confirmed. This abrupt resignation is one more point in the chaotic timeline of Kavanaugh's confirmation struggle.",
    " Title: Zelensky Denies Blackmail in Trump Call Amid Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that there was \"no blackmail\" in a phone call with Donald Trump that is at the center of a possible impeachment inquiry against the Republican president. Speaking to reporters in Kiev on Thursday, Mr. Zelensky said, \"This is not corruption, it was just a call.\"\n\nThe call, which prompted a whistleblower complaint and the Democratic impeachment inquiry, took place on July 25. Mr. Trump denies withholding US aid while pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. Impeachment is a process by which Congress can vote to oust a president, though it requires support from a majority of both chambers and, as such, is currently thought unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nDuring the call, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, who is a Democratic frontrunner for next year's White House election. His son, Hunter Biden, held a lucrative board position in 2014 with a Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, that found itself under scrutiny from a former prosecutor general. As US vice-president, Mr. Biden, like other Western officials, put pressure on Ukraine in 2016 to have the prosecutor fired, citing corruption concerns. Ukrainian officials have said there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nA rough transcript of the call released by the White House shows the conversation's content. The whistleblower who filed a complaint over the call reportedly wrote in a memo that a White House official who listened to the phone discussion described it as \"crazy\" and \"frightening.\" The official was \"visibly shaken by what had transpired\" in the call, according to the memo.\n\nA poll by Fox News, which is generally supportive of the president, found that 51% of voters are in favor of impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office. The results show 85% of Democrats were in favor of impeachment, while 82% of Republicans were against it. Mr. Trump has criticized the poll's results on Twitter, writing, \"Whoever their pollster is, they suck.\"\n\nLater on Thursday, the president is hosting his first rally since the launch of the impeachment inquiry in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Protests are expected against Mr. Trump, who lost the state by a narrow margin to Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe whistleblower whose complaint fueled the impeachment inquiry had a \"prior working relationship with a current 2020 Democratic contender\" and is a registered Democrat, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Thursday. The details of this working relationship or the candidate are unclear. Lawyers representing the anonymous whistleblower said in a statement their client \"has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party.\" They also noted that, as a government employee, their client has interacted with candidates from both parties \"in their roles as elected officials - not as candidates.\" The whistleblower's identity has remained a secret, though US media have reported he or she is a CIA officer.",
    " Title: NFIB Small Business Optimism Index Dips in July, Remains in Recession Territory\n\nArticle:\n\nIn its first index since the Supreme Court's Obamacare ruling in June, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index took another dip. The July index fell 0.2 points to 91.2, still holding steady in recession territory.\n\nThe index fell less than expected, the NFIB stated, and hit its lowest point during the recession in July of 2009 at 86.5. The highest level the index has reached during the recession was in February 2012 at 94.5. Before the recession, the index would often average above 100. The survey was compiled from the responses of 1,803 randomly sampled NFIB members.\n\nNFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg commented, \"Congress has recessed without a plan to resolve our calamitous debt/spending cycle or a lasting answer to our dangerous fiscal cliff.\" He added, \"The White House has presented us with some 'fuzzy math,' asserting that only three percent of small businesses will be impacted by planned tax increases. That's not true.\"\n\nDunkelberg explained that the denominator in that calculation is wrong\u2014it should be the 6 million employer firms that provide jobs to half the private sector workforce, meaning that more like 15 percent of small businesses can expect higher taxes in January. The lack of meaningful actions to address tax reform in Washington adds to the certainty of sluggish growth for the remainder of 2012, and the uncertainty of what will come in 2013.\n\nWith so much media coverage ahead of the Obamacare decision, Dunkelberg said respondents likely had a feeling the law would be upheld, therefore the drop from June to July wasn't as large as originally estimated.\n\nThe index found more business owners indicated business conditions to worsen for the next six months, and also believe real sales volumes will be lower in the next three months. Only five percent of business owners believe now is a good time to expand their business, a historically low number.\n\nFifty-four percent of business owners reported making capital outlays, up 2% over the past six months. Of those that made such expenditures, 38% spent on new equipment, 19% purchased vehicles, and 14% improved or expanded facilities. Those planning to make outlays over the next six months held steady at 21%.\n\nPoor sales was named the top problem for 20% of business owners surveyed. The net percent of small businesses reporting higher nominal sales over the past three months, seasonally adjusted, fell four points to -9%. This was after losing seven points in June's index.\n\nThe reported net change in job creation was -0.04%, but was better than June's rate of -0.11%. Before June and July, job creation was rising from December to May and were all either zero or positive. Seasonally adjusted, 10% of businesses added an average of 3.0 workers per firm, while 11% reduced employment by 2.3 workers per firm. The remaining 79% made no net change in employment.\n\nThe report found 48% of business owners did attempt to hire in the last three months, and 38% found few or no qualified applicants.",

Omar made the comments at a town hall event with fellow pro-Palestinian advocate Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).\n\nDuring the event, Omar stated, \"I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is ok for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\" Omar's comments were in reference to Israel, marking the second incident of derogatory speech toward the Jewish state and its supporters this month.\n\nIn an attempt to defend her comments, Omar said, \"A lot of people think because I am Muslim, every comment I make about Israel is anti-Semitic.\" NBC News reports that she went on to state the criticism prevents a \"broader debate\" about Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n\nRep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in which Omar serves, condemned her comments, suggesting that Israel demands allegiance from American lawmakers. \"I welcome debate in Congress based on the merits of policy, but it's unacceptable and deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including support for the US-Israel relationship,\" Engel said according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nEngel continued, \"We all take the same oath. Worse, Rep. Omar's comments leveled that charge by invoking a vile anti-Semitic slur.\" He also called on Omar to retract her comments, apologize, and commit to making her case on policy issues without resorting to attacks that have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House of Representatives.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, also condemned Omar's comments on Twitter. \"Lawmakers must be able to debate without prejudice or bigotry,\" Lowey tweeted. \"I am saddened that Rep. Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel. I urge her to retract this statement and engage in further dialogue with the Jewish community on why these comments are so hurtful.\"\n\nOmar defended her comments in a series of tweets, stating, \"Our democracy is built on debate, Congresswoman! I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee.\" She continued, \"I have not mischaracterized our relationship with Israel, I have questioned it and that has been clear from my end.\"\n\nOmar also criticized her Democratic counterparts in a tweet, stating, \"My Americanness is questioned by the President and the @GOP on a daily basis, yet my colleagues remain silent. I know what it means to be American and no one will ever tell me otherwise.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Omar wrote, \"Being opposed to Netanyahu and the occupation is not the same as being anti-Semitic. I am grateful to the many Jewish allies who have spoken out and said the same.\" Omar is currently in the Horn of Africa, and she tweeted about her experiences there, stating, \"I fight for peace and justice because only those who experience the pain of war, know the joy of peace.\"",

    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Arizona's Controversial Immigration Check Provision, Strikes Down Three Other Provisions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday issued a ruling on Arizona's controversial immigration law, striking down three provisions but upholding for now a key provision that requires police officers to check the immigration status of individuals they suspect may be in the country illegally during routine stops.\n\nThe provision on mandatory checks during routine stops will now be reviewed by a lower court and may still be subject to challenge. The rest of the ruling definitively strikes down three other provisions in the Arizona law, which made it a crime for immigrants to seek employment without work permits and to not carry their immigration papers, and allowed police to arrest anyone they suspect committed a deportable offense.\n\nThe court was unanimous in allowing the immigration checks to go forward, but divided on the rest. The decision now throws into question how other states that had followed Arizona's lead on immigration enforcement will proceed. In Washington, the Obama administration signaled a tough road ahead for those states by suspending a key enforcement program that allowed local officials to partner with federal agents in carrying out immigration law.\n\nThe court's decision on Monday prompted a range of reactions from officials in Washington and Arizona. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., told Fox News that the ruling was \"a bit of a mixed bag.\" Some Democrats expressed concern about the remaining provision, while others declared outright victory. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the ruling \"as strong a repudiation of the Arizona law as one could expect.\"\n\nOn the GOP side, a few lawmakers described the decision as disappointing, while keeping pressure on the Obama administration to fix the country's immigration system. Others saw a silver lining. Among them was Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who put out an optimistic statement Monday, indicating the state would move to carry out the remaining law, even without the three other planks.\n\nBrewer hailed the decision as a \"victory for the rule of law\" -- in reference to the one provision that was upheld. \"After more than two years of legal challenges, the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented in accordance with the U.S. Constitution,\" Brewer said.\n\nPresident Obama also said he was \"pleased\" by the ruling. \"What this decision makes unmistakably clear is that Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform,\" he said. \"A patchwork of state laws is not a solution to our broken immigration system -- it's part of the problem.\"\n\nBrewer said she expects legal challenges to the remaining provision of the law to continue. \"Our critics are already preparing new litigation tactics in response to their loss at the Supreme Court, and undoubtedly will allege inequities in the implementation of the law,\" she said.\n\nBrewer also cautioned her state's police officers against taking the policy too far, saying: \"Law enforcement will be held accountable should this statute be misused in a fashion that violates an individual's civil rights.\"\n\nThe federal government had claimed the law encroached on its authority to enforce immigration law. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion, which was released Monday, on behalf of the majority. Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nOn the immigration checks provision, Kennedy wrote that \"uncertainty\" over how that policy would be carried out prevented the court from assuming it would conflict with federal law. \"As a result, the United States can not prevail in its current challenge,\" Kennedy wrote.\n\nBut he offered words of warning pertaining to the rest of the law. \"Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,\" Kennedy wrote. The justice also noted that \"discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns,\" and also \"involve (s) policy choices that bear on this Nation's international relations.\"\n\nHe added: \"The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not diminish the importance of immigration policy to the States. Arizona bears many of the consequences of unlawful immigration.\" The Supreme Court is currently wrapping up its term, and the public is still awaiting a landmark decision on the federal health care overhaul, which is expected to be released on Thursday.",

Nine individuals were arrested, but the presence of a concrete barrier and the enforcement of law by police prevented chaos. Police were allowed to use pepper spray for crowd control, a measure that was banned through a city ordinance in 1997. Masks were also banned.\n\nDespite the high security costs, estimated at $600,000, the event did not cause significant disruption. Shapiro, in his speech, highlighted five key points, one of which was that when law enforcement is allowed to perform their duties, Antifa has less influence.\n\nThe event, which began at 10 P.M. EST, 7 P.M. PST, saw hundreds of police officers in attendance. These officers arrested individuals carrying weapons or masks, preventing violence in the crowd outside.\n\nShapiro's speech sparked controversy, with some students reporting emotional distress. One student stated they would be seeking counseling after the event.\n\nNine individuals were arrested outside the event, with offenses ranging from spitting at a police officer, possessing banned items, and assault, according to the Berkeley Police Department.\n\nIn a tweet, political cartoonist Scott Adams suggested that the ban on masks, a tactic used by the KKK, was effective in minimizing violence at the event.\n\nShapiro, in his speech, addressed the microaggression mentality, political attacks, and the importance of free speech on campus. He also thanked the police and the Young America's Foundation for their support.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, Shapiro considered it a success and expressed gratitude to the Young America's Foundation.",

    " Title: U.S. Unemployment Rate Drops Unexpectedly in May, Employers Add 2.5 Million Jobs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to 13.3 percent in May, down from a record high in April, indicating the nation's economy is recovering faster than expected from the coronavirus lockdown. The Labor Department reported that employers added a record-breaking 2.5 million jobs in May, while shedding a combined 22.1 million jobs in April and March. This leaves an estimated 21 million Americans currently out of work.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and NASDAQ Composite Index all experienced slight declines following the report's release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at $26,989.99 (-1.04%), the S&P 500 at $3,190.14 (-0.53%), and the NASDAQ Composite Index at $10,020.35 (+0.67%).\n\nEconomists surveyed by Refinitiv had expected the report, conducted in mid-May, to show that unemployment would rise to 19.8 percent in May and that employers would shed 8 million jobs. If the expectation had been accurate, it would have been the worst figure since the Great Depression.\n\nTony Bedikian, head of global markets at Citizens Bank, stated, \"Barring a second surge of Covid-19, the overall U.S. economy may have turned a corner, as evidenced by the surprise job gains today, even though it still remains to be seen exactly what the new normal will look like.\"\n\nLarry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, expressed the need for long-term measures in the next coronavirus relief package to support the economy.\n\nThe jobless rate dropped from 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest level since record-keeping began in 1948. The surprise decline, combined with the surge in jobs, suggests the worst is over for the nation's economy as states ease stay-at-home guidelines and businesses bring back staff.\n\nLeisure and hospitality, the sector hit hardest by the outbreak of the virus, accounted for almost half of the increase, with more than 1.2 million employees returning to their jobs last month. In April, the industry lost a staggering 7.6 million jobs. More than 1.3 million workers returned to food services and drinking places as states gradually allowed businesses deemed nonessential to reopen.\n\nConstruction also saw a significant jump in employment last month, with the sector adding 464,000 jobs. Education and health services increased by 424,000, and retail climbed by 368,000.\n\nThe number of unemployed Americans who reported being temporarily laid off decreased by 2.7 million in May, representing the majority of the jobs that returned. Among those who said they were not temporarily laid off, the number of permanent job losses continued to increase, rising by 295,000 in May to 2.3 million.\n\nOver the course of the past few weeks, every state has started to navigate reopening their economies. However, the unemployment level, which remains at the highest level since the Depression, is expected to remain elevated as social distancing guidelines remain in place.\n\nDaniel Zhao, a Glassdoor senior economist, stated, \"It's important to remember the labor market still faces an unemployment rate at the highest level since the Great Depression with tens of millions of Americans still out of work.\" He added, \"While the labor market may be on the path to recovery, there is still a long way to go until the labor market returns to pre-crisis levels and makes up for lost growth.\"",
    " Title: Nevada's Early State Advantage for Rand Paul Fades as Competition Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, Nevada, initially considered a stronghold for Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), has seen a shift in the political landscape. The large Republican field has diluted Paul's advantage, with his rivals aggressively contesting the state.\n\nAt a recent gathering in Gardnerville, Nevada, it was clear that Paul was not the focus of attention. Ted Cruz, a fellow Republican candidate, stole the show at the Basque Fry, a conservative event attended by four presidential candidates, including Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, and Cruz himself. Paul was absent, scheduled for a medical mission to Haiti.\n\nThe lack of Paul's presence was noticeable, and his absence was felt among the state's political class. One reason for this is the lingering tensions between supporters of Paul's father, former GOP Rep. Ron Paul, and the state Republican establishment. However, a simpler explanation is the increased competition in the Republican field, which offers anti-establishment and anti-Washington voters multiple viable options.\n\nMary Burgoon, a board member of the Nevada Federation of Republican Women in Carson City, expressed this sentiment, stating, \"I don't know anybody who's going to vote for him. There are a few diehards, but that's it. Why him, when we've got so many others anyway?\"\n\nThe Basque Fry drew four presidential candidates, and attendees reveled in their 2016 options. The candidates who spoke, including Fiorina, Carson, Walker, and Cruz, were well-received by the crowd.\n\nRand Paul's concessions to mainstream politics and his departure from his father's uncompromising style have also cost him some support, though the extent of this loss is unclear. Ray Rocha, president of the Republican Men's Club of Northern Nevada, noted, \"He's lost some of his father's people, and in my view, Cruz and Walker are taking them away from him.\"\n\nPaul's campaign, which is still in the process of coming together, is not concerned, according to Richard Bunce, an activist who coordinated Ron Paul's Nevada operation in previous cycles. Bunce stated, \"He pulls in standing-room-only crowds in Nevada, so he's a headliner person. He isn't going to be a part of the machine, which is what the event was, and so that was not his crowd.\"\n\nHowever, the fact that Paul's effort is still taking shape in a state that was expected to be a stronghold is itself revealing, and his rivals have taken notice. Several other presidential campaigns have already brought on staff, lined up key endorsements, and started to build out field operations. Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and other candidates have made strategic moves to gain an edge in Nevada.\n\nDespite the current challenges, some Nevadans recognize that it's a long road to February, and there is still time for change. Nick Phillips, former political director for the Clark County GOP, stated, \"There's plenty of time for change around here. But it could be interesting if people don't pay attention.\"",
    " Title: Mass Exodus of Christians in Islamic World: Unprecedented Displacement and Persecution\n\nArticle:\n\nA significant displacement of Christians is currently underway across the Islamic world, with millions of Christians being displaced from one end of the region to another. This mass migration is leading to a resurgence of Christianity's historical presence in the region, as much of the Islamic world, prior to the Islamic conquests, was predominantly Christian.\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has stated that the exodus of Christians from the region is unprecedented and is increasing year by year. The commission predicts that Christians might disappear altogether from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Egypt in the near future.\n\nIraq, once home to at least one million Christians in 2003, now has fewer than 400,000 remaining. This decline is attributed to an anti-Christian campaign that began with the U.S. occupation of Iraq, which saw numerous Christian churches bombed, and Christians killed, including through crucifixion and beheading. The 2010 Baghdad church attack, which resulted in nearly 60 Christian worshippers being slaughtered, is a notable example of this ongoing violence.\n\nSimilar patterns have emerged in Syria, where entire regions and towns where Christians lived for centuries before the advent of Islam have been emptied. The opposition targets Christians for kidnapping, plundering, and beheadings, all in compliance with mosque calls telling the populace that it is a \"sacred duty\" to drive Christians away.\n\nIn October 2012, the last Christian in the city of Homs, which had a Christian population of some 80,000 before the jihadis came, was murdered. A teenage Syrian girl stated, \"We left because they were trying to kill us... because we were Christians... Those who were our neighbors turned against us. At the end, when we ran away, we went through balconies. We did not even dare go out on the street in front of our house.\"\n\nIn Egypt, some 100,000 Christian Copts have fled their homeland following the \"Arab Spring.\" In September 2012, the Sinai's small Christian community was attacked and evicted by Al Qaeda-linked Muslims, according to Reuters. However, even before that, the Coptic Orthodox Church lamented the \"repeated incidents of displacement of Copts from their homes, whether by force or threat.\"\n\nMali, after an Islamic coup in 2012, saw as many as 200,000 Christians flee. In the north, rebels want to establish an independent Islamist state and drive Christians out. There have been house-to-house searches for Christians who might be in hiding, churches and other Christian property have been looted or destroyed, and people have been tortured into revealing any Christian relatives. At least one pastor was beheaded.\n\nEven in European Bosnia, Christians are leaving en masse \"amid mounting discrimination and Islamization.\" Only 440,000 Catholics remain in the Balkan nation, half the pre-war figure. Problems cited include the construction of dozens of mosques in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, while no building permissions were given for Christian churches.\n\nIn Ethiopia, after a Christian was accused of desecrating a Koran, thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes when \"Muslim extremists set fire to roughly 50 churches and dozens of Christian homes.\"\n\nIn the Ivory Coast\u2014where Christians have been crucified\u2014Islamic rebels have massacred hundreds and displaced tens of thousands of Christians.\n\nIn Libya, Islamic rebels forced several Christian religious orders, serving the sick and needy in the country since 1921, to flee.\n\nTo anyone following the plight of Christians under Islamic persecution, none of this is surprising. As I document in my new book, \"Crucified Again: Exposing Islam's New War on Christians,\" all around the Islamic world\u2014in nations that do not share the same race, language, culture, or economics, in nations that share only Islam\u2014Christians are being persecuted into extinction. Such is the true face of extremist Islamic resurgence.",
    " Title: Geithner's Alleged Deception: A Look at the 2009 Social Security Claim\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in a new memoir, has revealed that in 2009, he was asked by a senior adviser to then-President Barack Obama, Dan Pfeiffer, to suggest that Social Security was operating in the black and not a contributing cause of the ballooning federal deficit. This request, according to Geithner, was intended as a \"dog whistle to the left\" to convey a message to the president's political base, regardless of its truth.\n\nThe allegation, if accurate, adds to the growing list of controversies surrounding the Obama administration's honesty. The administration has been criticized for statements made regarding ObamaCare, NSA spying, and the Benghazi incident.\n\nThe question of whether government officials can legally lie has been a topic of debate. While the courts have ruled that the remedy for government lying is to vote officials out of office, the legality of such actions remains a contentious issue. The case of Roger Clemens and Martha Stewart, who were prosecuted for petty lies about private matters, contrasts with the lack of prosecution for Clapper and Rice, who allegedly misled the public on significant matters.\n\nThe Geithner allegations bring to light the potential consequences of government deception, as it may shatter the social contract between the government and the people, and officials who lie risk becoming a law unto themselves. The full extent of the truth behind Geithner's claims remains to be verified.",
    " Title: Comparison of Clinton Email Scandal and Petraeus' Federal Conviction Unfounded, Says Former Attorney General Mukasey\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who oversaw the prosecution of former CIA director David Petraeus, has stated that the comparison between Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State and Petraeus' federal conviction for unauthorized removal and retention of classified information is without merit.\n\nMukasey, who served as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, highlighted the key element that distinguishes Clinton's email retention practices from Petraeus' actions: Petraeus knowingly engaged in unlawful conduct, which formed the basis of his criminal liability.\n\nThe facts of Petraeus' case, as a matter of public record, reveal that during his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, Petraeus recorded handwritten notes in personal journals containing information he knew was classified at the highest levels. These journals contained top-secret and even more sensitive \"code word\" national defense information, including the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities, diplomatic discussions, and quotes and deliberative discussions from National Security Council meetings, including discussions with the president of the United States.\n\nPetraeus failed to mark these books as \"top secret\" and store them in a Secured Compartmented Information Facility. Instead, he allowed his biographer to take possession of the journals for use as source material for his biography. When questioned by the FBI, Petraeus lied to agents in responding that he had neither improperly stored nor improperly provided classified information to his biographer.\n\nMukasey emphasized that Petraeus' conduct was done \"knowingly.\" That is, when he stored his journals containing \"highly classified\" information at his home, he did so knowingly, aware that there was classified information in the journals and that they were stored improperly.\n\nIn contrast, Clinton is not being investigated for knowingly sending or receiving classified materials improperly. The State Department has confirmed that none of the information that has surfaced on Clinton's server thus far was classified at the time it was sent or received. Additionally, the Justice Department indicated that its inquiry is not a criminal one and that Clinton is not the subject of the inquiry.\n\nHere, the inspector general and the Justice Department are following an established protocol when it is determined that there has been an unauthorized disclosure of classified materials\u2014in this case, potentially due to a potential after-the-fact change in classification. This protocol ensures that any classified information is properly handled going forward.\n\nReasonable minds may differ about the wisdom of using a personal server to conduct the official business of the State Department. In recent days, Clinton has taken responsibility for using a private server and admitted that using separate accounts would have been a better choice. However, unlike the actions and prosecution of Petraeus, there has been no evidence of criminal conduct.\n\nAnne M. Tompkins, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and former United States attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, has provided this opinion.

    " Title: U.S. Election Outcome Won't Settle Major Issues, Economic Growth and Trust in Government Remain Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming U.S. election on Tuesday will not likely resolve many of the country's significant issues, as the economy and trust in government remain major concerns. The article points out that the U.S. has experienced one of the longest economic expansions in history since 2009, but the average growth rate of 2 percent is the weakest since 1949. Neither presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump, has presented a plan to significantly improve economic growth.\n\nClinton's proposed tax increases and spending hikes are expected to maintain the economy's current pace, while Trump's plan to add five trillion dollars to the national debt could dampen growth. The article also highlights the candidates' foreign policy positions, stating that neither has articulated a plan to stabilize the U.S. economy, reduce international terrorism, or bring order to hot spots in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, or Asia.\n\nTrust in major American institutions, including the media, religious organizations, labor, business, and the two major political parties, is at or near historic lows. The article notes that millennials, the largest generation, are the most skeptical. The Iraq War, President Obama's health care reform, and government surveillance have contributed to this distrust.\n\nThe article also mentions the leak of emails showing Hillary Clinton as two-faced and Donald Trump as a serial scam artist and bully. These revelations are expected to further erode trust in government and politics. The article concludes by stating that until the major parties start governing transparently and nominate candidates who are trusted by the majority of Americans, little is likely to change, and the situation may even worsen.",
    " Title: California's Homelessness Crisis: A National Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's homelessness issue has become a significant national concern, as the state accounts for a majority of the nation's homeless population growth. According to the latest federal data, the U.S. homeless population has increased by approximately 15,000 people, bringing the total to about 568,000, or 2.7%. However, California's homeless population has seen a more substantial increase, with over 21,000 more individuals without homes, representing a 16.4% rise.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reported this growth on Friday. The increase in California's homeless population is so significant that it overshadows declines in 29 states, including Washington, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and others with substantial housing pressures.\n\nWhile the national homeless population remains about 10% lower than it was a decade ago, California's has expanded by more than 22% in the same timeframe. With less than an eighth of the U.S. population, California is home to more than a quarter of the nation's homeless people and more than half of those who are unsheltered.\n\nMoreover, California's homeless population continues to grow, even as overall growth has slowed significantly. The state's Department of Finance estimated that California's population grew only 0.35% over the 12 months ending July 1, the smallest increase since 1900. Several counties, including Marin, Sonoma, Napa, and Santa Cruz, experienced population loss.\n\nHUD Secretary Ben Carson stated that \"homelessness in California is at a crisis level and needs to be addressed by local and state leaders with crisis-like urgency.\" The Trump administration has threatened a crackdown on California's homelessness issue.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and other state officials have been critical of advice from the Trump administration. However, HUD Secretary Carson's assertion that the state's response to homelessness is not commensurate with the human disaster at hand appears to be accurate.\n\nStudy after study has demonstrated the strong relationship between housing scarcity and homelessness. The California Legislature has not passed a comprehensive measure to expedite residential development since 2017 and has repeatedly shelved the most significant measure in play, SB50. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors, typifying the approach of too many local governments, voted against the measure for the third time last week.\n\nBeyond legislation to speed development, the state's rampant homelessness calls for reform on the order of the right-to-shelter policy backed by the leaders of Newsom's task force on the issue\u2014though not, so far, by Newsom himself. Anything less will enable more demagoguery and suffering.\n\nThis commentary is from The Chronicle's editorial board.

    " Title: Americans Donate Stimulus Checks to Charity and Aid Organizations Amid Unemployment Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans are facing financial hardships, with record numbers of job losses and increased unemployment claims. However, some individuals, such as Brooke Young, a Salt Lake City librarian, are using their $1,200 stimulus checks to support charitable causes and aid organizations.\n\nYoung donated $200 of her stimulus payment to a mutual aid group that provides groceries for people in need, a group that assists laid-off restaurant workers, the Salt Lake City Tribune, and the local alternative weekly newspaper. Young, who is not swimming in extra cash, expressed feelings of guilt for being financially secure while many are struggling.\n\nIn a separate instance, Toi Cudworth, a credit union employee in Texas, donated $950 of her stimulus payment to the San Antonio Food Bank after witnessing the long lines of people seeking food assistance. Cudworth also bought groceries for a neighbor recently laid off from his retail job and plans to help an elderly couple down the street.\n\nLaine Himmelmann, a fundraiser for Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento, donated $100 to her own employer and plans to give another $250 when she receives her stimulus payment. Himmelmann, who works for the organization, noted that they recently laid off 27 of their 30 employees.\n\nSome nonprofits and grassroots groups are actively soliciting stimulus check donations. Cosecha, a national group that helps undocumented immigrants, received over 1,100 pledges for donations from stimulus payments. Wendy Blackwell-Moore, a consultant and married mother of two in Maine, organized an online campaign called Pledge My Stimulus, encouraging people to donate their $1,200 stimulus payments to people in need.\n\nWhile some high-net-worth individuals may still qualify for stimulus checks due to their assets not being reported on their tax returns, tax preparer Adam Markowitz reported receiving inquiries from clients who wanted to know if they could refuse the payments. Markowitz advised clients to find a way to use the money for the greater good, such as donating to charity or helping those who provide essential services.",
    " Title: Missouri Businesses Reopen Amidst Rising COVID-19 Cases; Governor Lifts Restrictions Despite Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nMissouri's Republican Governor, Mike Parson, chose to ease restrictions on businesses and social gatherings in Liberty, Missouri, despite the state experiencing its largest increase in coronavirus cases on Monday. The decision came six weeks after initial restrictions were imposed.\n\nWhile some businesses opened their doors, the response was not as enthusiastic as some gun-toting protests against lockdowns and stay-at-home orders in other parts of the country might suggest. Tara Brendle, the owner of Brendle's barber shop, was one of the few who reopened, albeit with precautions such as obliging customers to wait outside and sanitizing equipment between appointments.\n\nBrendle expressed concerns about the resurgence of Covid-19, but felt compelled to reopen due to financial pressures. Lyle Hoover, a customer waiting for his first haircut since the lockdown, believed the pandemic was being exaggerated and that the economy was being manipulated.\n\nGovernor Parson's coronavirus policy has been met with criticism, particularly for his decision to tour electrical contractors and hunting and fishing stores without wearing a face mask, and for urging workers to return to their jobs if their employers demand it or risk losing benefits.\n\nMayors of Missouri's two largest cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, have kept restrictions in place, including the closure of restaurants for sit-down dining, gyms, and non-essential shops. Kansas City's mayor, Quinton Lucas, plans to limit restaurant seating to just 10% capacity or 10 people including employees when they reopen in the middle of the month.\n\nHammerhand Coffee, a cafe in Liberty's main square, remained closed on Monday, adhering to county guidelines that allow only 25% capacity, which doesn't make sense for a small cafe. The uncertainty about reopening was reflected in the square, where most businesses remained closed, with florists, boutiques, and jewelers still shut. Hueys on the Square restaurant, which had been giving away free boxed meals to families in need, was open with some tables marked \"no seating\" to keep patrons six feet apart.",
    " Title: Turkish Authorities Pursue Suspect in New Year's Istanbul Nightclub Massacre\n\nArticle:\n\nTurkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus has confirmed that authorities have the fingerprints and a general description of the gunman responsible for the New Year's mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub. Kurtulmus stated that investigators are close to identifying the suspect. A massive manhunt is currently underway, with Turkish police investigating potential links between the attacker and the cell responsible for the deadly suicide bombing at Istanbul's airport in June 2016.\n\nAccording to Kurtulmus, eight individuals are currently in police custody in connection to the nightclub attack. The IS-linked Aamaq News Agency claimed the attack was carried out by a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate\" who targeted the nightclub where Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.\n\nThe attacker reportedly took just seven minutes to unleash his terror, killing 39 people, including 27 foreigners, and wounding 69 others. Among the wounded was American Jake Raak, who was shot in the hip and had the bullet travel to his knee. Raak, from Delaware, stated that he survived by playing dead, remaining silent and not moving even after being shot.\n\nRaak's mother, Grace Raak, shared that her son traveled to Istanbul for his birthday. She expressed prayers for the injured and the families of those who lost loved ones. Raak, along with approximately 600 others, was inside the venue celebrating the New Year when the terrorist entered, reportedly shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" as he began firing indiscriminately.\n\nSecurity camera footage captured bullets grazing the bar's railing and a man in red, attempting to escape, but ultimately being trapped as the killer approached, firing a single shot from his AK-47. Eyewitness Komron Saidaliev described the scene as \"terrible.\"\n\nISIS, which referred to Turkey as \"the servant of the cross,\" claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that their soldier carried out the attack using an automatic weapon and hand grenades in \"revenge for God's religion and in response to the orders\" of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nCol. Steve Ganyard, a former State Department official, commented that nightclubs are attractive targets for jihadi terrorists due to their symbolizing secular decadence. Turkey, a NATO ally, has experienced 18 major terror attacks on its soil since 2015, with the January 1st attack marking the 19th.",
    " Title: Court Blocks Trump Administration's Title X Rule Affecting Planned Parenthood\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's final rule that bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds under Title X. The rule, known as the \"domestic gag rule,\" was first proposed last year and has been the subject of a legal battle since its release in March.\n\nThe new rule bars Planned Parenthood and any other provider that performs abortions or offers abortion referrals from receiving funding under Title X, which pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients. Anti-abortion groups have long backed such a rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. Planned Parenthood and other groups say that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to health care they need. Planned Parenthood says it sees about 41 percent of patients who get family planning services under Title X.\n\nThe rule immediately faced legal challenges from Planned Parenthood, the American Medical Association, the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), the American Civil Liberties Union, and a number of states. Earlier this year, the challengers won temporary injunctions keeping the rule from taking effect, but those injunctions were lifted after the Trump administration appealed. On July 3, the Ninth Circuit issued a new injunction, this one in connection with the suit by the NFPRHA and ACLU.\n\n\"Today's ruling is an important victory in the fight against the Trump administration's attempts to upend Title X,\" said Ruth Harlow, senior staff attorney for the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, in a statement. \"It allows us to go back to court to ensure that the millions of low-income people who rely on the nation's only family planning program will continue to receive vital health services\u2014and we will not give up until the rule is blocked for good.\"\n\nThe move to restrict Title X funds is one of a number of actions by the Trump administration that critics say will limit access to contraception and abortion. It also comes as the president ramps up his rhetoric on abortion, which he may see as a winning issue for him and the Republican Party in 2020.\n\nThe new rule would require providers that receive Title X funds to be both physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers for abortions. That means that because some Planned Parenthood health centers perform abortions, all Planned Parenthood centers would be barred from getting Title X funding. In addition to Planned Parenthood affiliates, Title X funds also go to Health Department centers, hospital-run clinics, and other facilities, all of which would be barred from performing abortions under the new rule.\n\nProviders were already banned from using Title X money to pay for abortions, but Title X funding recipients could still perform abortions if they covered the costs with other funds. The rule was first proposed in May 2018 but did not go into effect at that time. When it was finalized, the rule was scheduled to take effect this May. A similar rule was proposed under President Reagan but was only in effect for a month, in 1992. That rule prohibited Title X recipients from even discussing abortion, but the new rule does not go that far.\n\nAbortion opponents have applauded the rule. \"We thank President Trump for taking decisive action to disentangle taxpayers from the big abortion industry led by Planned Parenthood,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, in a statement. \"Americans United for Life is pleased that HHS has taken steps to stop Title X funds from subsidizing abortion,\" said Catherine Glenn Foster, president of the group, in a statement.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and other groups say it will leave many low-income patients without access to contraceptive care. Planned Parenthood also argues that the rule is illegal, since it violates laws requiring that pregnant patients receiving care through Title X get unbiased counseling about all of their options, which include abortion. In many places, Planned Parenthood is the only option for low-income patients; a 2015 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute found 103 counties where Planned Parenthood is the only provider of publicly funded contraceptives. If Planned Parenthood were locked out of Title X funds, other health centers might struggle to pick up the slack. According to another Guttmacher analysis, other providers would have to increase their caseloads by an average of 70 percent to serve all the patients currently seen by Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"If fully implemented, the proposed changes to Title X would shrink the network of participating providers and have major repercussions for low-income women across the country that rely on them for their family planning care,\" wrote a team from the Kaiser Family Foundation in a November 2018 analysis of the proposed rule. The Title X rule is just one of several moves by the Trump administration that limit access to contraception or abortion. In 2017, for instance, the administration released interim rules allowing almost any employer to get an exemption from the Obama-era requirement that employers offer contraceptive coverage as part of employee health insurance. Those rules were finalized in 2018, one day after the midterm elections. Trump has stepped up his anti-abortion rhetoric in recent months, after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's confusing comments on a bill in his state led to a larger controversy around abortions late in pregnancy. The president's appointment of conservative Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh has boosted his popularity among conservatives, according to Vivian Wang of the New York Times. And with a potential challenge to Roe v. Wade on the horizon, Trump may see opposition to abortion\u2014and to Planned Parenthood\u2014as a winning strategy going into 2020.",
    " Title: Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Calls for End to Filibuster in U.S. Senate, Urges Presidential Candidates to Follow Suit\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has called for the elimination of the legislative filibuster in the U.S. Senate and urged Democratic presidential candidates to support this move. In an opinion piece published in The New York Times on Monday, Reid criticized the Senate as an \"unworkable legislative graveyard\" due to the increased use of the filibuster by the Republican party.\n\nReid, a Nevada Democrat, argued that the filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold for legislation, should be replaced with a simple majority vote. He cited the filibuster's role in obstructing action on issues like climate change, immigration, and gun control.\n\nReid, who was instrumental in muscling through a rules change in 2013 to end the filibuster for many presidential nominees, recalled his own efforts and the subsequent Republican changes in 2017 that allowed for a simple majority vote on Supreme Court nominees.\n\nSome Democratic activists argue that 2020 presidential contenders cannot be taken seriously if they support maintaining the legislative filibuster, given the need for a sweeping agenda on issues like health care and climate change. While some presidential candidates have called for the outright abolition of the filibuster, others, such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have been more hesitant.\n\nThe filibuster, a procedural tool that allows for endless debate and requires a supermajority to end, has been a contentious issue in the Senate for decades. Its elimination would significantly alter the balance of power in the legislative body, potentially allowing for more swift passage of legislation with a simple majority.",
    " Title: Twelve Democratic Presidential Candidates Qualify for October Debate, Five for November\n\nArticle:\n\nTwelve Democratic presidential candidates have qualified for the October 15 debate, the most participants ever in a single presidential primary debate, according to the Democratic National Committee. The debate will take place on one night, despite more than 10 candidates qualifying.\n\nAs of October 1, the candidates who have qualified for the fourth debate are: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Juli\u00e1n Castro, and Tulsi Gabbard. Marianne Williamson is the only candidate who has not yet qualified, needing three more qualifying polls.\n\nTo qualify for the fourth debate, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls released between June 28 and Oct. 1, and collect contributions from 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states.\n\nFor the fifth Democratic debate in November, the qualifying criteria are stricter. Candidates will need four surveys of 3 percent or more in national or early-state polls and contributions from 165,000 unique donors, including at least 600 individual donors in at least 20 states. Candidates can also qualify via an early-state polling pathway, earning 5 percent in at least two polls in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.\n\nFive candidates have qualified for the November debate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. The remaining candidates need to earn 3 percent in at least four national or early-state polls or 5 percent in at least two early-state polls to qualify.\n\nThe qualifying process for the November debate indicates that the candidate field is consolidating into three main groups: the five polling front-runners who have easily qualified, a middle tier of seven candidates who are struggling to hit more than 2 or 3 percent in the polls, and a bottom tier of candidates who have virtually no chance of qualifying.\n\nSome candidates in the middle tier are close to qualifying, such as tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who each need only one more poll, and Sen. Cory Booker, who needs just two more. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke still need three more qualifying surveys, but they have a month or more to rack up those polls.\n\nNeither Gabbard nor former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro have a qualifying poll yet, but they have already cleared the donor threshold, which means they are still in a better position than the six candidates who haven't met the donor requirement or registered a single qualifying poll. Given the long odds that these candidates face, we might expect some more dropouts soon. For instance, Castro recently told supporters in a fundraising email that his campaign would close up shop if he failed to make the November debate. It's easy to imagine he wouldn't be the only one.",
    " Title: The Impact of Citizens United and Related Supreme Court Decisions on Campaign Finance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2010 Citizens United decision, a landmark Supreme Court ruling that loosened restrictions on campaign finance, has been a subject of controversy among Democrats. However, it is not the sole factor contributing to the influx of money in politics, and its effects have been less profound than often portrayed.\n\nThe Citizens United decision allowed corporations and unions to openly support political candidates, a practice that was previously possible under the guise of \"issue advocacy.\" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an organization that can now use undisclosed donations to advocate for or against specific candidates, had previously used such donations to influence elections.\n\nThe Citizens United decision was also cited in the 2010 Supreme Court ruling, SpeechNow.org v. FEC, which enabled individuals to pool unlimited donations in political committees operating independently of candidates. Wealthy individuals like Sheldon Adelson, who recently donated $10 million to a super PAC supporting Mitt Romney, have enjoyed the right to spend unlimited sums on their own campaign advocacy since the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo ruling.\n\nRobert Bauer, former White House counsel for President Obama, described Citizens United as an \"effective rhetorical tool\" for opponents of the decision but downplayed its importance in the creation of super PACs following the SpeechNow.org decision. Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat active on campaign finance issues, argued that the 2010 decision \"changed the psychology\" of campaign finance, producing an \"anything-goes atmosphere.\"\n\nDespite the significant sums raised through the regulated system, the largest donations have been raised through the system that now drives the campaign schedules of President Obama and Mitt Romney, as well as candidates for the House and Senate. In 2008, President Obama, who opted out of the post-Watergate public financing system, raised $745 million, compared to the $84 million allocated by the system during the general election for his opponent, John McCain.\n\nThe public financing system has eroded due to reluctance of taxpayers to contribute and the increasing ability of candidates to raise large sums through the internet and other means. However, Mr. Bauer noted that the $92 million on offer for the general election this year would limit the spending plans of both candidates.\n\nSome effects of the Supreme Court's recent rulings may become apparent later. In combination, the Citizens United and SpeechNow cases permitted corporations as well as individuals to donate to super PACs. Disclosures so far indicate that, while privately held corporations have taken advantage of this, publicly traded companies have not.\n\nJan Baran, a Republican campaign finance lawyer, explained that executives of publicly traded companies have shown \"an overwhelming sense of caution about funding this type of advertising\" due to concerns about offending shareholders. However, he noted that this might change by November.\n\nIn addition to blaming Citizens United for the state of campaign finance, Norman Ornstein, a political analyst, also criticizes President Obama for not pushing for a change to the decision. Ornstein argues that the current system will result in widespread, destructive government corruption similar to that produced by Watergate. He asserts that \"the only test for a federal officeholder or candidate is what they are really prepared to do to end this corrupt campaign finance system.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Government Airlifts $400 Million to Iran, Sparking Controversy Among Republican Lawmakers\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican lawmakers have expressed discontent over a report that the U.S. government airlifted the equivalent of $400 million to Iran in January, coinciding with the release of four American detainees by Tehran. The cash transfer, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, was the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a failed 1979 arms deal.\n\nThe cash, consisting of euros, Swiss francs, and other currencies, was used due to U.S. law prohibiting the transacting of American dollars with Iran. While the Obama administration denies the cash transfer was linked to the release of the four Americans, GOP lawmakers view it as a \"ransom.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) stated, \"Paying ransom to kidnappers puts Americans even more at risk.\" He further added, \"While Americans were relieved by Iran\u2019s overdue release of illegally imprisoned American hostages, the White House\u2019s policy of appeasement has led Iran to illegally seize more American hostages.\"\n\nThe four released Americans are Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter; Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine; Christian pastor Saeed Abedini; and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, whose case was not previously publicized.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby stated in an interview that the release of the Americans and the settlement payment were on separate tracks and any suggestion of a connection is \"utterly false.\" He argued that the \"compromise\" struck with Iran benefited taxpayers because potentially billions more could have been at stake.\n\nKirby further stated that the negotiations over the Americans and the settlement were conducted by different teams on each side. He said the funds transferred to Iran were related solely to the settlement of a long-standing claim at the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal at The Hague.\n\nHowever, The Wall Street Journal reports that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible. The Journal also reported that President Obama did not disclose the $400 million cash payment when he announced on January 17 that the arms deal dispute had been resolved. The administration has not disclosed how the $1.7 billion was paid, except to say it was not paid in dollars.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) stated, \"The logistics of this payment -- literally delivering a plane full of cash to evade U.S. law -- shows yet again the extraordinary lengths the Obama administration will go to accommodate Iran, all while hiding the facts from Congress and the American people.\" He added, \"Hundreds of millions in the pockets of a terrorist regime means a more dangerous region, period. And paying ransom only puts more American lives in jeopardy.\"\n\nSince the cash was airlifted, Iran's Revolutionary Guard has arrested two more Iranian-Americans. Tehran has also detained dual-nationals from France, Canada, and the U.K. in recent months.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Allows Lawsuit Alleging Presidential Emoluments Clause Violation to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge ruled on Wednesday that a lawsuit alleging President Donald Trump is illegally benefiting from profits made at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. can move forward. The decision is a significant development in a case initiated by the attorneys general of Washington D.C. and Maryland in June 2017.\n\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh tweeted, \"We won the first round! Our case moves forward!\"\n\nThe attorneys general argue that Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from receiving benefits from foreign governments without Congress' approval. The lawsuit alleges that businesses in D.C. and Maryland are adversely affected because organizations are choosing the Trump hotel over other area hotels to curry favor with the president.\n\nAn example provided in the complaint is the spending of thousands of dollars by Saudi Arabia at the Trump International Hotel, located in the Old Post Office building, between October 2016 and March 2017.\n\nIn February, the Trump Organization announced it had donated foreign earnings from its hotels to the Treasury Department, but the Maryland judge stated in his ruling that these calculations have not been verified or provided to the court.\n\nA similar lawsuit against Trump brought by a liberal watchdog group was dismissed by a federal judge in New York last year for lack of standing. However, in this case, the judge in Maryland has decided that the states do have standing.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the President is violating the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution by reason of his involvement with and receipt of benefits from the Trump International Hotel and its appurtenances in Washington, D.C., as well as the operations of the Trump Organization with respect to the same,\" Judge Peter Messitte ruled Wednesday.\n\nTrump was summoned in the Maryland case last week, and his lawyers now have three weeks to respond. The details of the president's involvement and the extent of the alleged benefits are yet to be determined as the case proceeds.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Maintains Fundraising Advantage Over Donald Trump in Final Days of Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final phase of the 2016 U.S. presidential race, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton holds a significant fundraising advantage over her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump. According to the latest fundraising reports, Clinton's campaign and joint accounts with the Democratic Party had $153 million as of last week, more than double the $68 million held by Trump's campaign and partnership committees.\n\nThis financial edge allows Clinton to maintain a large political operation in the race's final days. Her staff of over 800 is several times larger than Trump's, and she has spent more on advertising than the Republican candidate every week of the campaign.\n\nOver the course of the primary and general elections, Clinton's campaign has raised $513 million, approximately double Trump's total. In the first 19 days of October, Clinton's campaign raised $53 million, while Trump brought in around $30 million.\n\nTrump, a New York businessman who claims to be worth $10 billion, typically contributes about $2 million per month to his campaign but had not made such a contribution in October, according to the latest contribution reports, which were up to date as of Wednesday. He had given only about $33,000.\n\nThe candidates and various groups involved in the presidential race are filing their final pre-election fundraising reports on Thursday. These reports cover the first 19 days of October.\n\nOutside groups supporting Clinton are better funded than those backing Trump. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from wealthy donors but may not coordinate with the campaigns. The pro-Clinton Priorities USA raised $18 million in the first 19 days of October, with significant contributions from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Susan Mandel, the wife of a hedge fund founder, who each donated $2.5 million this month. Priorities USA plans to spend $21 million on TV ads this week and next, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker.\n\nOn the other hand, Rebuilding America Now, one of several pro-Trump groups, raised only about $215,000 through the early part of October. As of last week, the super PAC had about $1.2 million in cash on hand. Another pro-Trump group, Great America PAC, raised $2 million and had about the same amount left to spend.",
    " Title: Thousands of Migrants Head North in Caravan; Trump Threatens to Close U.S.-Mexico Border\n\nArticle:\n\nA large group of mostly Honduran refugees, estimated to number in the thousands, has crossed into Guatemala and is believed to be heading towards the U.S. border. Hundreds of migrants have already arrived at the Guatemalan border town of Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n, along the southern border of Mexico, according to James Fredrick of NPR. Organizers of the caravan anticipate thousands more will join them in the coming days before attempting to cross the Mexican border.\n\nMexico has increased security along its southern border and will only allow migrants with valid documentation, such as a passport, to enter the country. However, most of the migrants in the caravan do not have such documents.\n\n\"You can tell Mexican security forces are preparing because there are dozens of police in riot gear waiting here for the imminent arrival of this caravan,\" Frederick told NPR, standing on a bridge that links Mexico and Guatemala. Most of those who had gathered were from Honduras, he said, but there were also people from El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nJudy, a 34-year-old woman in the group who requested her last name not be used, said her home country of Honduras has become dangerous. \"No safety, jobs, and the hospitals lack medicine,\" she said. \"Basic freedoms are being oppressed by the government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez,\" she added, stating that Honduras feels unlivable for her right now.\n\nMexico's interior ministry said it would seek support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as it prepares to receive potentially thousands of refugee requests in the coming days. The Mexican government says that migrants may apply for asylum in Mexico, but they'll have to do so from a detention center. Mexico warned that if migrants are caught crossing illegally, they will be detained and deported.\n\nWith the midterm elections in the U.S. just weeks away, President Donald Trump kept immigration front and center by threatening to close the entire U.S.-Mexico border to prevent the migrants from entering. \"I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\" he tweeted Thursday.\n\nIn the spring, Trump tweeted angrily when an earlier caravan of Central Americans made their way through Mexico with the intention of crossing into the U.S. He threatened to cut foreign aid to Honduras and send the military to the border. In the end, some of the migrants went home, and a few hundred crossed the San Ysidro port of entry, south of San Diego, and requested asylum.\n\nIt's uncertain how the president would block the current group of immigrants from crossing at a legal port of entry. Longstanding federal and international laws allow immigrants to present themselves at a border crossing and seek protection as refugees. They are referred for a \"credible fear\" of persecution or torture screening to an asylum officer, who decides if they should be deported or continue the asylum process.\n\nRecent presidents, including Trump, have deployed National Guard troops to the southwestern boundary to assist Border Patrol in catching and processing unauthorized immigrants. However, they have not blocked the ports of entry, which are under the control of agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson sent active-duty troops to the border during the Mexican Revolution, roughly 100 years ago, to stop raiders such as Pancho Villa from crossing into border states. Today, the migrants Trump wants to keep out appear to be mainly young Hondurans, including parents with small children, who are seeking asylum in the United States. Trump tweeted there are \"MANY CRIMINALS\" in the caravan, without providing evidence.\n\nTrump has long maintained that \"catch-and-release loopholes\" in U.S. immigration laws lure immigrants from Central America. The Department of Homeland Security is compiling year-end figures for apprehensions at the southern border. DHS Spokeswoman Katie Waldman wrote in an email to NPR that the department's totals will likely show \"record numbers of families arriving illegally in the United States this year.\"\n\nWhile thousands of immigrant families are being arrested at the border every week in places like Texas' Rio Grande Valley and Nogales, Arizona, the numbers are still far below the peak in 2000, when 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants were arrested. The difference is that the big numbers 18 years ago were mainly single Mexican males who were quickly deported, whereas the current surge is primarily made up of families seeking amnesty, which allows them to remain in the U.S. for months or years while their case grinds through the backlogged immigration courts.\n\nWaldman added that the agency \"is examining all options to secure the border.\"",
    " Title: Worst Campaigns of 2014: A Review of High-Profile Gaffes, Staff Shakeups, and Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2014 election has been marked by sweeping national forces, including an unpopular president, a shaky economy, and increasing concerns about national security. However, the fundamentals of running a strong campaign remain crucial for candidates, and this year, some campaigns have been particularly challenging.\n\nOne candidate who has made numerous high-profile gaffes is Bruce Braley, a Democratic congressman and Iowa Senate hopeful. In a radio interview last year, Braley complained about the impact the government shutdown was having on the House gym, stating, \"There's hardly anybody working down there. There's no towel service, we're doing our own laundry down there.\"\n\nIn a video of him speaking to a gathering of trial lawyers in Texas, Braley described Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, whom Iowans have elected to the Senate six times, as \"a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law.\" Braley was warning the group that Grassley is poised to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Republicans win the Senate.\n\nFurthermore, while marching in a parade in July, Braley was caught on video appearing to say that he's a farmer\u2014even though there's no evidence to suggest he is. (Braley's campaign states he made the remark after mishearing what a parade-goer was asking him.) Braley has also had to deal with a series of unflattering stories detailing a nasty dispute between his wife and a neighbor whose chickens invaded the Braleys' yard.\n\nRepublicans have used these gaffes to brand Braley as out of touch. In July, with his lead over GOP hopeful Joni Ernst evaporating, Braley shook up his campaign, replacing his admaker and pollster. Today, polls show Braley, who is defending the seat Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin has held for three decades, in essentially a tied race.\n\nAnother high-profile campaign that has faced challenges is Eric Cantor's. Cantor's blowout primary loss to an obscure college professor, Dave Brat, came as a complete shock to just about everyone. From start to finish, Cantor ran a lackadaisical, messy campaign. He ignored key conservative groups that ultimately threw their support to Brat, lost his control over the local Republican Party machinery, and spent little time campaigning in the district.\n\nCantor, who long had his eye on the House speakership, seemed more interested in Washington than on his suburban Richmond constituents. Cantor's biggest mistake might have been running a series of hard-hitting TV ads attacking Brat by name. Brat's advisers later said the spots provided critical name ID with voters who'd never heard of him.\n\nFew tears are being shed for Cantor now: He quickly landed new digs\u2014and a multimillion-dollar salary\u2014at a Wall Street investment bank.\n\nWendy Davis, a candidate for Texas governor, has also faced numerous challenges. Davis' June 2013 filibuster against a restrictive anti-abortion measure in the Texas Legislature endeared her to liberals nationwide. However, it's been all downhill from there for Davis, a candidate for Texas governor.\n\nA Dallas Morning News story in January raised questions about inconsistencies in how she recounted her life story. In March, she had a weaker-than-expected showing against an obscure and underfunded primary opponent. A month later, she was dissed by her own party's governors association. And in June, the state senator shook up her campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, in a conservative state that hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, Davis has struggled to demonstrate that she's focused on more than abortion rights. A recent New York Times poll showed Davis trailing Republican state Attorney General Greg Abbott by double digits.",
    " Title: Cracks in Biden's Union Support Emerge in Philadelphia, Home of Presidential Campaign Headquarters\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who launched his 2020 campaign in a union hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is facing signs of decreased support from union workers in Philadelphia, the city where he has his campaign headquarters. This development comes as Biden is set to appear at a \"Workers' Presidential Summit\" hosted by the AFL-CIO in the city on Tuesday.\n\nPhiladelphia, being the largest city in Pennsylvania and home to oil refineries and their union employees, is a crucial area for Biden, who represented the state in the U.S. Senate for over 30 years. However, more than a dozen current and former union leaders and workers in Philadelphia have questioned Biden's loyalty, citing his support for phasing out the fossil fuel industry, which many in the region rely on for jobs.\n\nRyan O' Callaghan, the former union head of a now-shuttered Philadelphia refinery, stated, \"I think Biden has taken our votes for granted. Our plant closed, and we didn't hear from him.\" The Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery, the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, closed in August following a massive fire, idling more than 1,000 employees, including 650 union workers.\n\nLarge job cuts in a key battleground state like Pennsylvania could have provided Biden with an opportunity to bolster his blue-collar appeal and force Republican President Donald Trump to address the shutdown of a major refinery in the state during his term. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 with a margin of less than 1 percentage point over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump also won Michigan and Wisconsin, traditionally Democratic Rust Belt states, with narrow margins.\n\nClinton beat Trump by only 9 percentage points among voters from union households, according to exit polls, significantly less than President Barack Obama's 18-point advantage over Mitt Romney in 2012. When auto union workers went on strike at General Motors on Sunday, Biden tweeted, \"Proud to stand with @UAW to demand fair wages and benefits for their members. America's workers deserve better.\" However, his silence on the refinery, and that of other Democratic presidential candidates, suggests that the party's aggressive environmental agenda may be limiting Biden's ability to address issues that seem to align with his blue-collar image.\n\nBiden is not the only Democrat grappling with reconciling calls to phase out fossil fuels with the need to attract union workers who rely on refineries, power plants, and pipelines. As someone who draws on his upbringing in the working-class stronghold of Scranton, in northeastern Pennsylvania, and has been speaking the language of unions for years, Biden positions himself as the only candidate who can bring back Rust Belt workers who defected from Democrats to vote for Trump in 2016.\n\nTerry Madonna, a political scientist at Franklin & Marshall University in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, stated, \"Right now, he's trapped between his historical support for the unions on energy issues and the left wing of his party on environmental issues who are pushing for a Green New Deal, and he needs them both.\" Philadelphia labor support is essential for any Democrat aiming to win a statewide election, as large turnout in the region can offset Republican margins in central parts of the state, according to Madonna.\n\nThe criticism from workers in Biden's own backyard highlights his challenges. Most workers at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery were laid off without severance pay and extended health benefits, while top executives collected $4.5 million worth of retention bonuses just weeks before the company filed for bankruptcy in July.\n\nBiden's campaign did not directly respond to why he has remained silent on the shuttered refinery, but noted Biden's history of supporting labor, including helping to usher in the 2008 bailout of the auto industry and opposing Republican-led efforts to limit union participation. Campaign officials also referred to how Biden's clean energy plan calls for replacing oil industry jobs with well-paying, green-energy jobs.\n\nBiden has secured some union backing. The International Association of Firefighters, one of the nation's largest unions with some 300,000 members, endorsed Biden on the first day of his campaign. The firefighters did not endorse any candidate in 2016. The United Food and Commercial Workers 1776 Keystone State, with some 35,000 members in Pennsylvania, has decided to endorse Biden, union president Wendell Young told the source for the first time.\n\n\"He has been a rock-solid supporter of labor over all these years. As much as I like all the Democrats, I know Joe, and I know what Joe has done,\" Young said. However, with 20 Democrats vying for the White House, including U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, whose anti-Wall Street message and opposition to trade deals also resonate with the blue-collar constituency, most unions are unlikely to rush with an endorsement.\n\nSanders in August won the endorsement from the 35,000-strong United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America, which has long supported the Vermont senator. The signs of division among union members regarding Biden are evident.\n\n\"If Joe is the candidate, he will definitely get our support,\" Pat Eiding, head of Philadelphia's AFL-CIO, said. \"I do think, with the refinery in Philadelphia, there are legitimate questions being asked about where he is.\" James Maravelias, head of Delaware's AFL-CIO, which represents some 40,000 workers and endorsed Clinton in 2016, said 2020 Democratic candidates need to demonstrate why they deserve union support.\n\n\"If Democrats think that trade union support is a slam dunk, they are sorely mistaken,\" Maravelias said. \"As for Joe Biden, I am not sure where he is on these issues. Haven't seen him a long time.\"",
    " Title: Foreign Fighters in ISIS: A Smaller Threat Than Perceived\n\nArticle:\n\nApproximately 100 Americans and over a thousand Europeans have joined the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), according to various reports. This raises concerns about these individuals returning to their Western homelands and potentially plotting attacks. However, the risk of such attacks is relatively low, according to experts.\n\nThomas Hegghammer, the director for Terrorism Research at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, states that the actual number of Western jihadis on the ground is lower due to many returning home. He estimates that at most one in nine Western jihadis who fought in a foreign war have come home to plot attacks, but this estimate is based on a low-end estimate of the total number of foreign fighters. The ratio of returnees attempting an attack in the West is likely between one in 20 and one in 100, according to Hegghammer.\n\nTo date, there have been \"about four to six plots, involving five to ten people, in the West,\" Hegghammer notes. This results in a blowback rate of one in several hundred, a vanishingly small number. The number of ISIS volunteers returning to plot terrorist attacks in the West is relatively low, partly because ISIS is not prioritizing attacks on the United States or Europe, as they are too busy fighting to preserve the caliphate.\n\nWill McCants, director of the Project on US Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution, states that it is easier to identify ISIS volunteers on their way home than on their way to Syria or Iraq. US intelligence is likely to find them, partly due to the obsession with monitoring borders and the threat they pose, but also because jihadis are known for their social media activity.\n\nThe risk is greater for European countries due to the higher number of Europeans fighting for ISIS and the difficulty in detecting them when they travel over land rather than through airports. However, even in Europe, the risk is not significant. Terrorists planning major attacks would be difficult to stay off the grid, as they would need to communicate with family, friends, or other militants to obtain materials, making them easier to intercept by European intelligence agencies.\n\nClint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, notes that Europe has a \"big problem\" on its hands, but even if ISIS decides to plan a significant attack in Europe, it would be challenging to do so. Watts suggests that the complexity and time required to plan and execute a major attack, such as the 9/11 attacks, make it unreasonable to expect ISIS to replicate such an event.",
    " Title: President Obama Pushes for Federal Gun Control Measures, Citing Colorado as Example\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is advocating for the reinstatement of federal gun control measures, citing Colorado as a model for such legislation. On Wednesday, the president spoke in Colorado, a state that recently passed a series of gun control bills, including background checks for all gun purchases and limits on ammunition magazine sizes.\n\nThe president aims to see similar measures implemented nationwide, but Colorado serves as a cautionary tale as well. The Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, reopened this week following a mass shooting last summer that left 12 dead and nearly 60 others injured during a late-night screening of a Batman movie. The suspect, James Holmes, is facing the death penalty, and Colorado lawmakers responded to the shooting with new gun control laws.\n\nState Representative Rhonda Fields, who represents the Aurora neighborhood where the movie shooting took place, shared her thoughts on the tragedy. \"I could only imagine what it was like sitting in that theater, about ready to see something that you were anticipating, and then, you know, it's just a life-changing event,\" she said.\n\nFields, who lost her son to gun violence seven years earlier, became an advocate for gun control. This year, she found support in Colorado's Democratic House and Senate, with lawmakers \"forced\" to act after the mass shootings in Aurora and later at a Connecticut elementary school.\n\nObama has been counting on public outrage to advance gun control bills nationwide. \"This is our best chance in more than a decade to take common-sense steps that will save lives,\" he said at the White House last week. Obama warned that while polls show strong support for universal background checks and other gun control measures, there is powerful opposition from the gun lobby.\n\nDudley Brown, who runs the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners organization, is one such opponent. His office is located in the small town of Windsor, near a river named for the gunpowder French trappers once stored there. Brown argues that universal background checks are a step toward identifying gun owners, allowing the government to seize their weapons, and calls the 15-round limit on ammunition magazines arbitrary. He threatens political payback in next year's election that could cost Colorado Democrats their majorities.\n\nSimilar threats have had a powerful effect in Washington, where universal background checks now face an uphill battle. Here in Colorado, state Representative Fields says she has no regrets. \"I just feel like it was the right thing to do,\" she said. \"It was the right thing to do for public safety. And if I get recalled because of it, I still think that I was on the right side of history.\"\n\nFields has a message for the president and Congress: Don't give up.",
    " Title: US Navy Destroyer Collides with Oil Tanker Near Singapore, Ten Sailors Missing\n\nArticle:\n\nTen US Navy sailors are missing and five have been injured after the guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with an oil tanker east of Singapore. The incident occurred at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday) as the USS John S. McCain prepared to perform a routine port stop in Singapore.\n\nThe collision took place east of the Strait of Singapore, and the US Navy destroyer sustained damage to its port side. The tanker it collided with, Alnic MC, sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship 7m (23ft) above the waterline, but none of its crew were injured, and there were no oil spills.\n\nThe US Navy 7th Fleet later issued a statement saying the USS John S. McCain had now arrived at Singapore's Changi naval base. Significant damage to the hull resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms. Damage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding.\n\nThe Alnic MC is making its way to the Raffles Reserved Anchorage in Singapore. One crew member of the oil tanker told Reuters over the phone that the vessel sustained some damage to a valve. The ship was carrying nearly 12,000 tonnes of oil from Taiwan to Singapore.\n\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said there was no report of oil pollution, and traffic in the Singapore Strait is unaffected.\n\nThis is the second collision involving a US Navy ship in recent months and is thought to be the fourth such collision involving US warships in the past year alone. The timing of this incident is awkward for the United States, as it's the first day of annual drills between the US and South Korean armies.\n\nThe USS John S. McCain is part of the US Navy's 7th Fleet, its largest fleet, but this accident will add to questions about the operations of the navy in the region more widely. This is also thought to be the fourth time in a year that a US navy vessel has been involved in an accident.\n\nJust two months ago, seven US sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship in Japanese waters near the port city of Yokosuka. Those who died were found in flooded berths on board the ship after the collision caused a gash under the warship's waterline.\n\nThe USS John S. McCain is named after US senator John McCain's father and grandfather, both of whom were admirals in the US Navy. It is also known by its nickname Big Bad John. Operating from the US naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, it is part of the US 7th Fleet patrolling the Pacific. It has a crew of more than 300 sailors and officers and a full displacement of 9,000 tons. In May, it successfully passed a navy inspection for mission readiness at sea. The vessel was heading from Pyeongtaek, South Korea, en route from Taiwan to Singapore.",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose New Compromise for Obamacare Repeal and Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans, under pressure to deliver a win for President Trump, are working on a new compromise for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The proposal, led by Rep. Thomas MacArthur, a New Jersey Republican, aims to shift the burden of deciding what services insurers must cover to the states, while allowing insurers to charge healthy customers less, provided states set up risk pools to subsidize sicker individuals priced out of the market.\n\nThe MacArthur plan would maintain the requirement for insurers to cover individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, preserving the most popular part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. In a statement on his Facebook page, Mr. MacArthur, chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said the amendment would make coverage of pre-existing conditions \"sacrosanct for all Americans\" and ensure essential health benefits remain the federal standard.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether the proposal can win over enough holdouts to pass. The first attempt at repeal and replacement ended in a stalemate last month when leaders were unable to muster the votes and had to withdraw the bill. According to a Republican aide, lawmakers do not even have legislative text of the proposal, making it uncertain whether it can bridge the gap.\n\nPresident Trump, however, expressed optimism about the progress, stating that House Republicans could revive their plan and hold a vote either next week or shortly thereafter. Under the MacArthur plan, states could waive Obamacare's \"essential health benefits\" package, which requires insurers to cover a slate of services such as mental health and maternity care. They could also scrap community rating, in which insurers are required to charge the same prices to everyone in a given area.\n\nThe plan would allow states to allow insurers to charge sicker consumers more than healthy ones, provided they set up a \"high-risk pool\" to absorb some of their costs. This could win over hard-line House Freedom Caucus members, but may scare off centrists who don't want to tweak the guarantees of Obamacare.\n\nWhile sicker customers could still get covered, they might face high premiums, according to health care analysts. The details of the high-risk pool, including who would be in it and how much they would have to pay to get covered, will be crucial.\n\nCritics of the plan argue that it could make coverage unaffordable for many older consumers and segregate high-cost consumers in coverage that would likely be inadequate unless the high-risk pools were very generously funded. Sen. Christopher Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, stated, \"The Republican health care repeal bill was an unworkable, unpopular piece of garbage a month ago, and it still is today.\"\n\nThe published plan does not provide much detail on the state waiver process, though it suggests waivers would be easy to obtain. The HHS secretary is supposed to approve the plan within 90 days of determining it is complete, provided the state attests that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs, increase the number of persons with health care coverage, or advance another benefit to the public interest in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for persons with pre-existing medical conditions.",
    " Title: Recounts in Key 2016 Battleground States Show Little Change in Trump's Victory Margin\n\nArticle:\n\nRecounts in three key 2016 battleground states are proceeding, but they are doing little to alter the mathematical basis for Donald Trump's victory. In Wisconsin, one of the states where Green Party candidate Jill Stein has sought a fresh tabulation, the president-elect has gained on Hillary Clinton. The push for a recount in Pennsylvania is awaiting a federal court's approval, and a similar effort in Michigan has encountered new judicial turbulence.\n\nIn Wisconsin, where the recount began last Thursday after Stein paid $3.5 million, there has been little change so far to the unofficial results reported on Election Day. Trump won the state by 22,000 votes over Clinton. As of Wednesday morning, Trump had widened his victory margin over Clinton in Wisconsin by 146 votes, with 23 of the state's 72 counties having finished their recounts as of Tuesday. In those counties, Trump gained 105 votes, and Clinton dropped 41 votes.\n\nStein, who received about 1% of the vote in the states under question, stated her intent was not to help Clinton but to verify the accuracy of the count as she believed the votes were susceptible to computer hacking. However, Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, reported that \"We're not finding any problems with the machines. The Stein campaign wanted a recount because they thought there was some problems with our machines, and that was not the case.\"\n\nIn Green Lake County, which is about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee, the unofficial results from election night had Trump winning with 6,213 votes to Clinton's 2,701. The recount found that Trump actually received 6,216 votes while Clinton lost eight votes to finish with 2,693. In those counties where Clinton picked up votes on Trump, Wisconsin officials said the number was not enough to influence the results.\n\nA statewide hand recount of Michigan's roughly 2.8 million ballots that began on Monday is now up in the air as a federal judge will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to stop it. The state elections board is also meeting Wednesday, a day after the Michigan appeals court ordered it to dismiss Stein's recount petition, claiming she has no standing. The court noted that she received 1% of the vote and has no chance of catching Trump, who narrowly defeated Clinton in the state. A federal judge takes up the matter next.\n\nAccording to the certified results from late November, Trump won the state by about 10,700 votes \u2013 or about two-tenths of a percentage point. The recount so far was looking at eight counties, including the state's largest, Wayne. A controversy is brewing in that county as officials said Tuesday that one-third of precincts could be disqualified from the recount because of problems with ballots.\n\nWayne County \u2013 home to Detroit \u2013 overwhelmingly voted for Clinton late last month, but officials couldn't reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results. During the canvass, the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59% of precincts, 392 of 662. Michigan state law prohibits precincts whose poll books don't match with ballots from recounting votes.\n\nDespite the issue in Wayne County, experts say it will have little effect on the results in Michigan, or nationally. \"They are not going to affect the decision, but the discrepancy certainly warrants further investigation,\" Ned Foley, a professor of election law at Ohio State University, told FoxNews.com. \"Even if it did change the results in Michigan, it still wouldn't matter because Clinton needed to win all three states to surpass Trump in the Electoral College.\"\n\nVerification measures have been taken in Pennsylvania's two largest counties \u2013 Philadelphia and Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) \u2013 but the fate of a statewide recount rests in the hands of a federal court after Stein's Green Party filed a federal lawsuit on Monday. While Pennsylvania has yet to certify its results from November's election, an updated count by state election officials saw Trump's lead shrink to just about 46,000 over Clinton out of the 6 million votes cast in the state. So far, there have been very few reports of discrepancies in the recounts that have taken place.\n\nA re-examination of Allegheny County voting machine results did not change any votes, and, in Philadelphia, Clinton gained only five votes after the City Commissioner's Office recounted votes in 75 of Philadelphia's more than 1,600 voting divisions in response to the recount appeal by more than 250 Philadelphia residents.

    " Title: Democratic Candidates Face Backlash at California Convention for Criticizing Progressive Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the Democratic Party convention held in California over the weekend, candidates who did not align with the current progressive manifesto were met with boos. Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper was jeered when he stated that \"socialism is not the answer.\" Similarly, former Maryland Representative John Delaney was heckled for saying that \"Medicare for all\" is \"not good policy nor is it good politics.\"\n\nThe most surprising aspect of the progressive free-for-all that took place in and around San Francisco was not the lack of tolerance or the obvious distaste for debate. Instead, it was the fact that none of the candidates addressed the state's own issues, particularly the deteriorating quality of life in California due to liberal policies.\n\nCalifornia, once one of America's most beautiful cities, is now plagued by squalid tent cities, human waste on the streets, rising crime rates, and soaring cost of living. From 2007 to 2016, California saw its population shrink by 2.5 percent, losing a net 1 million residents.\n\nAccording to a poll by Edelman Intelligence, 53 percent of Californians are considering leaving the state, up from 49 percent the year before. Among millennials, the figure is 63 percent, making New York look downright popular. High housing costs and high taxes are significant reasons for the exodus. In 2018, California boasted the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S., at 12.3 percent, with an additional 1 percent for those making $1 million or more.\n\nThe majority of people moving to California are migrating from other high-tax locales like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois; they may not be aware of the state's issues, or they may be exhibiting a form of Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nFamilies with children and people without a college degree are also departing en masse. They cannot afford the high cost of living in California. In other words, California legislators, who claim to be concerned for the poor, have embraced policies that are driving low-income people out of their state.\n\nCalifornia is ranked by CNBC as the second-most expensive state in the country, behind only Hawaii. CNBC also ranks the state 48th in cost of doing business, which may be why thousands of firms are leaving California for friendlier locales.\n\nPolicies that have led to high housing costs, jacked up the cost of gasoline, and encouraged the abandonment of nuclear power and fossil fuel generation facilities are driving people and businesses out. California's energy costs may get much worse due to ambitious goals of generating half of its electricity from renewables over the next decade.\n\nReal people living in California suffer the fallout from these policies, leading to high prices for housing and energy, a laissez-faire approach to law and order that leads to tent cities and rising crime, and big government programs that mean diminished personal freedoms.\n\nVoters across the nation should take note, even if the candidates themselves notice nothing.

    " Title: Senate Confirms Controversial DOJ Criminal Division Director Amid Alfa Bank Ties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Brian Benczkowski as the new director for the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Criminal Division in a 51-48 vote on Wednesday. The confirmation was supported by Republican senators and one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin from West Virginia.\n\nDemocrats had criticized Benczkowski's nomination due to his close ties with Alfa Bank, a Russian bank linked to President Vladimir Putin. Last year, while a private attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, Benczkowski represented Alfa Bank in a legal matter. The FBI had investigated the bank after it appeared in the Steele dossier, a collection of unproven allegations about President Trump. The FBI concluded there was no wrongdoing or misconduct by the bank, according to a 2017 article in The New York Times.\n\nBenczkowski has stated he will recuse himself from any matter involving Alfa Bank during the first two years of his Justice Department tenure. However, Democrats have argued that Benczkowski's connection to the bank will undermine the investigation into Russian election interference led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAs head of the DOJ's criminal division, Benczkowski will play a role in overseeing Mueller's probe and the criminal investigation into Michael Cohen, the president's former personal lawyer. In May, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee demanded President Trump withdraw Benczkowski's nomination, citing his continued representation of Alfa Bank during the selection process.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions praised Benczkowski's confirmation, calling him an \"outstanding lawyer\" with a \"diverse\" public service and criminal law background. Sessions added, \"This will be the sixth senior position Brian has held at the Department, and we are fortunate to have someone with his breadth of experience and strong leadership skills willing to serve again.\"",
    " Title: Private Organization's Control Over Presidential Debates Raises Questions About Political Representation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a private organization that sets the criteria for presidential debates, operates under Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations. The CPD's 2020 debate schedule, as well as a recent court opinion, has sparked discussions about the control of the government.\n\nThe CPD, despite claiming to follow pre-established, objective criteria for candidate participation, has been criticized for limiting the participation of third-party candidates in presidential debates. This limitation is a result of the CPD's power to set standards, which it can maintain as long as it does not endorse, support, or oppose a candidate and selects at least two debate candidates.\n\nThe CPD's structure allows it to satisfy FEC requirements while setting \"objective\" standards that are difficult for third-party candidates to meet. This is due to the fact that those with the most to gain from the major parties, such as corporations and media, can fund the debates.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the CPD began in 1987 when the League of Women Voters (The League) withdrew its support after discovering the two major political parties had control over questioners, the composition of the audience, and press access during debates. The League's president, Nancy Neuman, characterized these actions as \"campaign-trail charades devoid of substance...that would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.\"\n\nSince the CPD's inception, only one third-party candidate has been invited to debate - Ross Perot, Reform Party candidate, in 1992. In the 2000 election, the CPD amended its criteria to require participants to secure at least 15% support in selected polls. This requirement is rarely achieved by a third-party candidate and is much higher than required for state ballot qualification or public financing.\n\nThe real action, however, was in the courts. Level the Playing Field and Gary Johnson, Libertarian Party, litigated against the 15% poll criteria, alleging FEC and CPD regulatory non-compliance and violations of First Amendment rights and the anti-trust laws. The FEC and the federal courts dismissed all complaints, leaving the two major parties in complete control of the debates.\n\nAn appeals court noted, \"Every four years, we suffer through the celebration of democracy (and national nightmare) that is a presidential election.\" The trial court dismissed statements by the Republican and Democratic chairs of the CPD as \"old news,\" stating that the CPD director asserted CPD officials are \"permitted to wear multiple hats and can speak freely...in [their]...personal capacity.\"\n\nThe activities of the CPD are the latest efforts to ensure the two major parties control the political landscape. The results of their efforts are staggering, with the two major parties controlling 99.92% of all elected U.S. offices. Despite this massive political control, Gallup finds 61% of Americans believe a third-party is needed.\n\nThe two major parties rig the system, so they win. Who do these political parties represent?",
    " Title: Syrian Electronic Army Website Taken Offline by Internet Body Following Alleged Disruption of Major News Websites\n\nArticle:\n\nThe website for the hacker group known as the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) was taken offline by an Internet body in response to the group's alleged disruption of several major news websites, including The New York Times. The SEA claimed responsibility for redirecting Internet traffic from the Times' and other websites on Tuesday, leading to their account suspension by domain name registrar Name.com.\n\nIn a Tweet from the SEA's official account, @ Official_SEA16, it was stated that their website would be unavailable for several hours due to the account suspension. Name.com did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation.\n\nFollowing an attack on Tuesday afternoon that took The New York Times' site offline, the company set up alternative websites, posting stories about chemical attacks in Syria. The service was restored early Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper stated on its website that the disruption was caused by a \"malicious external attack\" that affected its website and email. Twitter spokesman Jim Prosser said the viewing of images and photos was sporadically affected. The Huffington Post U.K. did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Twitter and The New York Times said they were resolving the attack, which actually hit an Australian company, Melbourne IT, that registered their domain names.\n\nTheo Hnarakis, chief executive of Melbourne IT, the world's sixth largest registrar of Internet domain names, said the security breach occurred at a major U.S.-based global reseller, or domain agent, where the hackers launched a \"spear phishing attack\" within the past week to steal the log-in details of the New York Times and Twitter domains.\n\nHnaraski declined to name the reseller, which is a major Melbourne IT client.\n\n\"This activist group used a very, very sophisticated spear phishing attack,\" Hnarakis told AP. \"They sent very dubious emails to staff of one of our resellers whose area of expertise is looking after the domain names for major corporates including the New York Times.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, a couple of the staff members of the reseller responded by giving their email log-in details; the group were able to search their emails for sensitive information that included the user name and password for the New York Times, and from there it all cascades,\" Hnarakis said.\n\n\"We do not put this down to a technical failure. We put it down to human error where someone has inadvertently provided their information and from there, a major site like the New York Times was down for several hours,\" he added.\n\nThe hackers had also attempted to hack into Twitter.com, but failed because that domain was protected by an optional secondary security feature offered by MelbourneIT for the past two years. The Times had opted not to have the same level of security.\n\n\"If they had had the security option turned on, they would not have been affected,\" MelbourneIT chief technology officer Bruce Tonkin said.\n\n\"We do have a security mechanism that would protect the names from this sort of attack,\" he added. \"Naturally, we are reviewing security and doing an incident review and will probably add some additional security.\"\n\nTonkin said the hacker seemed to have also accessed the credentials of the Huffington Post domain, which is held by a UK registry.\n\n\"The hackers have just posted a screen shot to say they've logged into the (Huffington Post) account, but I'm not aware that they actually changed anything,\" Tonkin said.\n\nComputer forensics from security firm Renesys Corp. traced the Internet protocol addresses back to the same ones as the Syrian Electronic Army's website, sea.sy, which the firm said has been hosted out of Russia since June.\n\nA Syrian Electronic Army activist confirmed to The Associated Press that the group hijacked the Times' and Twitter's domains by targeting Melbourne IT.\n\n\"I can't say how, but yes we did hit Melbourne IT,\" the hacker said in an email. No further details were disclosed.\n\nThe hacker's true identity is not publicly known, but he has long used an email address linked to the group, and a second group member has vouched for his credentials.\n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army has, in recent months, taken credit for Web attacks on media targets that it sees as sympathetic to Syria's rebels, including prior attacks at the New York Times, along with the Washington Post, Agence France-Press, 60 Minutes, CBS News, National Public Radio, The Associated Press, Al-Jazeera English and the BBC.\n\nMichael Fey, a chief technology officer at Santa Clara, California-based cybersecurity firm McAfee, said that as long as media organizations play a critical role as influencers and critics, they will continue to be targets of cyberattacks.\n\n\"Regardless of technology or tactics deployed, we should expect to see more of these attacks,\" he said.",

    " Title: China's Trade Surplus with U.S. Hits Record in August Amid Escalating Trade Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's trade surplus with the United States widened to a record $31.05 billion in August, according to customs data released on Saturday. This surpasses the previous record set in June. Over the first eight months of the year, China's surplus with its largest export market has risen nearly 15 percent, adding to tensions in the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\nChina's annual export growth in August moderated slightly to 9.8 percent, the data showed, the weakest rate since March but only slightly below recent trends. The number missed analysts' forecasts that shipments from the world's largest exporter would rise 10.1 percent, slowing only slightly from 12.2 percent in July.\n\nDespite U.S. tariffs targeting $50 billion of Chinese exports being in effect for their first full month in August, China's exports to the United States still accelerated, growing 13.2 percent from a year earlier from 11.2 percent in July.\n\nChina's imports from the United States grew only 2.7 percent in August, a slowdown from 11.1 percent in July. The world's largest trading nation got off to a strong start this year, but its economic outlook is being clouded by the rapidly escalating U.S. trade dispute and cooling domestic demand.\n\nTrump upped the ante on Friday, warning he was ready to slap tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports to the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days.\n\nWashington has long criticized China's huge trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing reduce it. However, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance, and tensions remain over limits on U.S. firms' access to Chinese markets, intellectual property protection, technology transfers, and investment.\n\nImports, a key gauge of the strength of China's domestic demand, grew 20 percent, beating forecasts. Analysts had expected growth of 18.7 percent, slowing from July's surprisingly high 27.3 percent. That resulted in China posting a smaller overall trade surplus of $27.91 billion for the month. Analysts had expected the surplus would rise to $31.79 billion from $28.05 billion in July.\n\nThe surplus with the United States was larger than China's net surplus for the month, indicating China would be running a deficit if trade with the world's largest economy was excluded. While no one predicted a sudden, sharp blow from U.S. tariffs, China's official export data has been surprisingly resilient so far, with growth exceeding analysts' expectations for five months in a row.\n\nChinese officials acknowledged Chinese exporters have been rushing out shipments to beat new U.S. tariffs, buoying the headline growth readings, while some companies such as steel mills are diversifying and selling more products to other countries. Economists have noted that disruptions in supply chains are likely to be more company-specific, and will take time to be reflected in broad economic data and corporate earnings reports.\n\nHowever, anecdotal evidence of mounting trade damage on both sides of the Pacific is on the rise. Official and private manufacturing surveys for China show global demand for Chinese goods is clearly on the wane, with export orders shrinking for months in a row.\n\n\"Risks have increased due to the negative impacts of China-U.S. trade friction. The impact on exports may gradually start to show up, with future export growth possible declining,\" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications.\n\nPolicymakers have shifted their focus in recent months to improving credit conditions and shoring up business confidence. Beijing is ramping up spending on infrastructure projects to spur domestic demand and the central bank is tamping down borrowing costs and leaning on commercial banks to continue lending to struggling firms hit by trade troubles.\n\nBut such steps will take time to arrest the economy's slide, and analysts expect the government to unveil more stimulus measures if business conditions continue to deteriorate.",
    " Title: Trump to Emphasize U.S. Sovereignty at UN General Assembly\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is set to address the United Nations General Assembly next week, continuing his focus on U.S. sovereignty amid concerns from some world leaders about America's commitment to multilateralism. According to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Trump's address on Tuesday will serve as a \"marker\" on U.S. foreign aid and a reaffirmation of the importance of U.S. sovereignty.\n\nIn the past year, the United States has withdrawn from several international agreements and organizations, including the Iran nuclear deal, the U.N. Human Rights Council, the Paris climate agreement, and global talks on a migration pact. The U.S. has also left the U.N. cultural agency, cut funding for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees, and sparked a trade war with China. At a NATO summit in July, Trump threatened that the U.S. would \"go its own way\" if members did not spend more on defense.\n\nTrump is now surrounded by hawkish advisers, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, after the departure of their predecessors Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster, along with former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. While some leaders and diplomats have expressed concern about the future of multilateralism since Trump took office in January last year, they rarely name and shame.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declined to comment on Trump's impact on multilateralism, stating, \"I don't like to personalize things.\" Guterres did, however, acknowledge that trust in political establishments, among states, and in international organizations has been eroded.\n\nTrump is expected to chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction on Wednesday, allowing him to address Iran and flaunt the latest developments in his attempt to get North Korea to denuclearize. Trump has long been skeptical of the value of the United Nations, though Haley has shown him the world body's worth by pushing the Security Council several times to toughen sanctions on North Korea.\n\nTrump is planning to meet privately with the leaders of South Korea, Egypt, France, Israel, Japan, and Britain. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has a close relationship with Trump, will stress the importance of \"collective action\" and multilateralism in his address to the United Nations shortly after Trump. A French presidential source stated, \"We don't see it as two opposing dialogues. We will continue to encourage the U.S. to join this multilateralism even if it's difficult on some subjects like trade, Iran, or climate.\"",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Suggests Return to Pre-ACA Healthcare System, Faces Criticism on Insurance Coverage and Medicaid Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney hinted at his plan to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), suggesting a return to the status quo ante. Romney stated, \"We had health care in America before Obamacare came along. And we still have health care in America.\"\n\nHowever, the statement overlooks the fact that millions of Americans did not have health insurance before the ACA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 4 in 25 Americans, or nearly 49 million Americans, had no health insurance last year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that repealing the ACA would deny access to insurance to about 30 million Americans who would receive coverage if the president's reforms were to stay in place.\n\nRomney also failed to mention that his budget proposal to cap federal spending at 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and boost defense spending to 4 percent of GDP would result in massive cuts to Medicaid. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program \"would face cumulative cuts of $1.5 trillion through 2022 if Medicare is subject to cuts and $1.9 trillion if Medicare is exempt.\" As a result, \"14 to 19 million more people\" would join \"the ranks of the uninsured.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday meeting with the editorial board of an Ohio newspaper, The Dispatch, Romney again suggested that the pre-reform health care system was good enough and also minimized the gravity of forgoing insurance. He stated, \"We don't have a setting across this country where if you don't have insurance, we just say to you, 'Tough luck, you're going to die when you have your heart attack.'\" Instead, \"you go to the hospital, you get treated, you get care, and it's paid for, either by charity, the government, or by the hospital.\"\n\nHowever, Families USA, a health care advocacy group, issued a report in June indicating that 26,100 people between the ages of 25 and 64 died prematurely due to lack of health coverage in 2010. The implication is that forgoing insurance can have serious consequences, contradicting Romney's assertion that people can still receive care without insurance.",

Rand Paul (R-KY) outlined a proposed spending limit for the federal government at $2.6 trillion during a policy speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California on Friday. The libertarian-conservative senator, who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate, emphasized his stance as a fiscal conservative while addressing a crowd of supporters and skeptics.\n\n\"I'm not against all government. I'm actually for $2.6 trillion dollars worth,\" Paul said, distinguishing himself from the perception that some Republicans hold about libertarians. He aimed to clarify his position as a libertarian-conservative who values the environment and supports common-sense regulations balanced with economic growth and job creation.\n\nPaul also addressed the Republican Party's image problem, stating that the GOP needs to change perceptions in order to win in \"bluish\" states like California. He argued that Republicans care deeply about the environment but also prioritize job creation and economic growth.\n\nThe senator's speech comes as he positions himself as a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election, seeking to define his political identity and distinguish himself from his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who had a controversial image among some Republicans.",
    " Title: Senate to Decide on Fast-Track Trade Negotiating Powers Amidst Climate Change Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate is set to decide on Tuesday whether to grant President Barack Obama fast-track negotiating powers, also known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), in a major filibuster showdown. The decision is significant as the TPA is crucial for the president to conclude negotiations on a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal.\n\nThe debate surrounding the TPA has become a battleground for global warming, with opponents on both sides of the political spectrum expressing concerns. Conservatives argue that the TPA could be used to write a binding climate deal into any agreement, while liberal opponents question the agreement's effectiveness in addressing climate change.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican leading conservative opponents, fears that the TPA could provide Obama with the means to impose global warming controls on the U.S. by negotiating stricter greenhouse gas emissions into a binding international agreement and circumventing Congress.\n\nIn response, U.S. Trade Representative Michael B.G. Froman has insisted that the administration is not trying to deceive Congress. In a letter this month to Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Wisconsin Republican, Mr. Froman ruled out a number of areas where Republicans fear circumvention, including climate change agreements.\n\nHowever, a bill Republicans are trying to pass as part of the trade package, known as the customs enforcement legislation, adds even more restrictions to the president's powers, including a specific prohibition on negotiating global warming or immigration deals as part of trade agreements.\n\nDemocratic trade opponents, on the other hand, fear that these restrictions could hinder the U.S.'s ability to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The trade package has been on weak legislative ground for weeks, with opponents voting against worker assistance to poison the entire package.\n\nThe Senate will vote Tuesday on heading off a filibuster of the fast-track powers bill, then likely will vote Wednesday on the worker assistance legislation, which has been coupled with a popular set of trade preferences for African countries and Haiti\u2014a bid to entice Democrats.\n\nThe fast-track bill could go straight to the president after passage, but the worker assistance would have to go back to the House, where Democrats would be faced with a final decision on whether to further embarrass their party leader. Congress is also likely to vote on beginning a conference committee to hammer out final details on the customs enforcement bill.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, expressed optimism, stating, \"With just a little more trust, a little more cooperation, and simply voting consistently, we'll get there.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Rates Affordable Care Act an \"8,\" Cites Progress and Ongoing Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with ABC News published on Wednesday, former President Barack Obama rated his signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), an \"8\" on a scale from 1 to 10. He acknowledged that there is still room for improvement in the 2010 overhaul, which has been a political flashpoint since its passage.\n\nPresident Obama highlighted the progress made by the Affordable Care Act in reducing the number of uninsured Americans. He stated, \"Sixteen million people or more have health insurance that didn't have it before.\" He also mentioned that the law's cost has been lower than projected, although he expressed disappointment that many states have not expanded the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act encourages states to extend the federal-state Medicaid program to individuals earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government covers 100 percent of the expansion's cost from 2014 to 2016, before scaling back its contribution to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. However, due to the Supreme Court's decision, only 28 states and the District of Columbia have expanded their Medicaid programs.\n\nPresident Obama criticized this situation, stating, \"We're just seeing some stubbornness that's really based on ideology, not on wise public health policy, that is preventing most people in most states from getting the Medicaid that would save the state money in the long term.\"\n\nThe overall health law remains a key target for the Republican-majority Congress, which is aiming to use a budget tool called \"reconciliation\" to pass a filibuster-proof repeal bill, forcing President Obama to veto their actions. Additionally, the Supreme Court is set to rule by June on whether the administration is unlawfully paying out exchange subsidies to at least 34 states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov portal. Without these subsidies, the law would be less attractive in those states, potentially providing the GOP with an opportunity to push their own health reforms.\n\nPresident Obama has expressed a willingness to make changes to his law, having signed some measures and delayed parts of the law, but not the type of Republican-led bills that would scrap its mandates or otherwise weaken it.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Raid on Islamic State Leader Yields Intelligence and Second Raid Resulting in Death of Spokesman\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. military raid that resulted in the death of Islamic State (IS) founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi also produced valuable intelligence concerning the militant group and its top leaders, according to defense officials. The intelligence, which includes data-storage devices and other files, is expected to contribute to the understanding of IS as the U.S. and its allies continue their pursuit of IS leaders and operatives.\n\nIn a subsequent operation, a U.S. raid led to the death of IS's top spokesman, Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, according to a senior State Department official. The operation was announced by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who worked with U.S. troops in fighting IS before President Trump ordered a U.S. withdrawal.\n\nFollowing the U.S. raid on Saturday, Baghdadi's remains were buried at sea, a U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal, similar to the disposition of the body of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after he was killed in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a briefing on Monday that Baghdadi's remains were handled appropriately, without elaborating. Gen. Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, addressing reporters at the Pentagon, said they are working to declassify images of the Saturday raid at Baghdadi's compound and may soon release them to the public.\n\nMany questions about the raid remain unanswered, as officials have not provided details about the 11 children and two adults they said were taken from the Baghdadi compound, or about the three children Mr. Trump said were killed with Baghdadi when he fled into a dead-end tunnel and detonated a suicide vest. Officials have not disclosed how many people were believed killed in the operation or whether any civilian casualties may have resulted.\n\nU.S. warplanes aimed guided bombs at the compound, destroying it after members of the U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force teams departed, defense officials said. Gen. Milley and Mr. Esper were with Mr. Trump on Saturday, watching the raid as it unfolded on video taken from various angles, an experience the president likened to a movie.\n\nHowever, Gen. Milley said he was unable to confirm Mr. Trump's assertions that Baghdadi was crying and whimpering as he tried to flee. The video seen at the White House didn't capture the audio of Mr. Baghdadi's voice in the underground tunnel where he eventually died, defense officials said.\n\nMr. Trump spoke to some of the more than 50 U.S. special-operations team members who took part in the raid, but Gen. Milley did not. A U.S. military dog assisting troops chased Baghdadi into the tunnel and was injured. Gen. Milley and Mr. Esper declined to release the dog's name, citing operational security. However, a defense official identified the dog as a Belgian malinois, a breed frequently used to support military units, and Gen. Milley said the dog was still in the region and would fully recover.",
    " Title: Democratic Candidates Make Last-Minute Push in Iowa Ahead of Caucuses\n\nArticle:\n\nOn the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Democratic presidential candidates intensified their efforts to rally voters and secure support in the final hours before the contest. Speaking to several hundred supporters in Cedar Rapids on Sunday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders declared, \"We are the campaign of energy and excitement,\" and expressed confidence in their position to win on Monday night.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, emphasized his newcomer status, telling a rally in Coralville that when Democrats have won the White House in the past, \"we have done it with someone who is new in national politics.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, highlighting his decades of Washington experience, told voters there is no time for \"on-the-job training.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged her supporters to \"fight back\" if they ever lose hope.\n\nThe Democratic race in Iowa is unusually large and jumbled, with four candidates locked in a fight for victory, and others in position to pull off surprisingly strong finishes. Polls show Biden in a close race in Iowa with Sanders, Warren, and Buttigieg. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are also competing aggressively in the state.\n\nThe deep disdain for President Donald Trump has put many in the party on edge about the decision. A series of external forces has also heightened the sense of unpredictability in Iowa, including Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate, which kept Warren, Sanders, and Klobuchar in Washington for much of the past week.\n\nNew caucus rules have left the campaigns working in overdrive to set expectations before the contest. For the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party will release three sets of results: who voters align with at the start of the night, who they pick after voters supporting nonviable candidates get to make a second choice, and the number of state delegate equivalents each candidate gets.\n\nThe new rules were mandated by the Democratic National Committee as part of a package of changes sought by Sanders following his loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries. The revisions were designed to make the caucus system more transparent and to ensure that even the lowest-performing candidates get credit for all the votes they receive. However, party officials in Iowa and at the DNC have privately expressed concerns in recent weeks that not just Sanders but multiple campaigns will spin the results in their favor, potentially creating chaos on caucus night.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party will declare a winner based on the number of state delegates each candidate wins. The AP will also report all three results. Biden's campaign appeared to be trying to lower Iowa expectations, cautioning against reading too much into Monday's results. Biden is hoping to sustain enough enthusiasm and money coming out of Iowa to make it to more diverse states where he hopes to draw strong support from black voters. His campaign is particularly focused on South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary schedule.\n\nSanders, Warren, and Klobuchar fanned out across the state, trying to make up ground after missing most of the last two weeks of campaigning due to the Senate impeachment trial. In a conference room in Cedar Rapids, Klobuchar appealed to caucus-goers by asking them to think about the voters who won't be caucusing\u2014moderate Republicans, voters who swung from Barack Obama to Trump, and voters who stayed home in 2016.\n\nMany voters are still making last-minute moves. According to a Monmouth University poll in Iowa in late January, 45% of all likely Democratic caucus-goers named a first choice but said they were open to the possibility of supporting another candidate, and another 5% did not indicate a first choice. Indeed, talking to Iowa Democrats can be dizzying. Many can quickly run through what they like\u2014and what worries them\u2014about the candidates in rapid fire, talking themselves in and out of their choices in a matter of minutes.",
    " Title: Ferguson Mayor Maintains No Racial Divide in City Despite Ongoing Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nFerguson Mayor James Knowles reaffirmed his stance on racial tensions in his city during a Tuesday interview with MSNBC's Tamron Hall, asserting that none of the city's residents believe there is a racial divide in the community.\n\nDuring the contentious interview, Knowles, who has previously downplayed racial tensions in Ferguson's history, was asked whether his opinions had changed in light of the outcries following the fatal shooting of unarmed African-American 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9.\n\n\"I don't believe that's the case, still. There's not a racial divide in the city of Ferguson,\" the mayor said.\n\nWhen asked about the source of this perspective, Hall inquired, \"According to whom? Is that your perspective, or do you believe that is the perspective of African-Americans in your community?\"\n\nKnowles responded, \"That is the perspective of all residents in our city, absolutely.\"\n\nThe mayor also stated that the violent clashes between protesters and police officers since Brown's death have involved a small minority of Ferguson's black community. \"There's 22,000 residents in our community. This has affected about a half-mile strip of street in our community,\" he said of the demonstrations. \"The rest of the African-Americans in our community are going about their daily lives, going to our businesses, walking their dogs, going to our neighborhood watch meetings.\"\n\nThough he acknowledged criticism that Ferguson's police department is disproportionately white, with more than 90 percent of the force being white and blacks making up 63 percent of the city's population, Knowles still maintained that Ferguson was a \"model\" for Missouri.\n\nKnowles has faced criticism about potential racial issues in his police department. According to official Ferguson police statistics, 86 percent of all stops and 92 percent of all searches in 2013 were of black people. Blacks were also arrested nearly twice as much as whites.\n\nKnowles has previously called allegations that Ferguson has experienced racial tensions through its history \"absolutely ridiculous.\"",
    " Title: House Democrats to Begin Passing Individual Spending Bills Amid Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats have announced plans to start passing individual spending bills this week, starting with a bill that funds the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The move is intended to pressure congressional Republicans and the White House during the ongoing partial government shutdown.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi announced the strategy over the weekend, following the Democrats' passage of a package of bills on Thursday that provides full-year funding for eight affected departments and extends current-year funding for homeland security until September 8.\n\nAccording to Pelosi, the first individual bill on the agenda is the spending bill that covers the Treasury Department and IRS. \"This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule,\" Pelosi said. \"The certainty of the tax returns of hard-working families should no longer be held hostage to the president's reckless demands.\"\n\nThe White House has already rejected the House-passed legislation, stating it falls short on border security. However, passing the bills one-by-one allows Democrats to highlight the potential real-world effects of the partial shutdown, which has now extended beyond two weeks.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, stated, \"Unless Congress acts, the American people will not receive their tax refunds, families will lose food stamps, homebuyers seeking mortgages will remain in limbo, and our National Parks will continue to accumulate garbage and waste.\"\n\nIn addition to the Treasury Department and IRS bill, House Democrats also plan to act on three other individual bills that cover funding for the departments of agriculture, interior, and transportation, among other programs.\n\nDuring the 2013 government shutdown, House Republicans employed a similar strategy, rolling out smaller, piecemeal bills to re-open shuttered national parks and other programs to try to pressure the Senate, then controlled by Democrats. However, former Sen. Harry Reid, then the majority leader, wouldn't take them up, stating lawmakers shouldn't pick and choose individual departments and that the entire government should be re-opened.\n\nIn October 2013, Mr. Reid rejected a question on why Democrats wouldn't take up a bill to fund the National Institutes of Health. \"If you can help one child who has cancer, why wouldn't you do it?\" asked CNN's Dana Bash. \"Why would we want to do that?\" replied Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat. Mr. Reid later tweeted, \"Republicans are in such desperate straits that they have literally resorted to accusing me of not caring about kids with cancer. Shameful.\"",
    " Title: Trump Reaffirms Support for School Safety Measures, Defers Action on Age Limit for Gun Purchases\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stated that the issue of raising the minimum age for purchasing certain guns is moving rapidly, but he is currently observing court cases and rulings before taking any action himself. In a tweet on Monday, Trump referred to the age limits as \"18 to 21 Age Limits,\" stating that he is \"watching court cases and rulings before acting.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) filed a federal lawsuit last Friday over gun control legislation signed by Florida Governor Rick Scott, which raises the age to buy guns in the state from 18 to 21. Under federal law, licensed firearm dealers cannot sell handguns to individuals under 21 and cannot sell long guns to those under 18. Trump has suggested supporting a raise in the age for long guns to 21.\n\nHowever, the White House's recent proposals to prevent school shootings did not include a plan to raise the minimum age to buy long guns. The proposals do, however, include a full audit and review of the FBI tip line after warnings about the student who carried out the shooting at a Florida high school last month were not acted upon.\n\nThe administration reaffirmed Trump's support for a congressional measure, known as Fix NICS, that aims to help local officials improve efforts to enter data into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The administration also supports the STOP School Violence Act, which aims to improve school security and provide some funding for such efforts.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that \"Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!\"\n\nThe president also reiterated his opposition to schools being designated as gun-free zones, stating, \"If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!\"\n\nThe recommendations were announced nearly a month after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.",
    " Title: U.S. Vice President Assures Baltic States of U.S. Support in Face of Potential Russian Aggression\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence has assured the Baltic states of U.S. support if they face aggression from Russia, reaffirming Washington's commitment to NATO's collective defense doctrine. During a meeting with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, Pence emphasized the U.S.'s unwavering support for NATO's Article 5, which requires member countries to defend each other if attacked.\n\nPence's comments come amidst Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and President Donald Trump's early lukewarm support for NATO. In May, during a visit to NATO's Brussels headquarters, Trump caused concern among allies by not restating U.S. support for a critical portion of the alliance's charter and instead criticized some members for insufficient defense spending. However, Trump has since stated his support for Article 5.\n\n\"A strong and united NATO is more necessary today than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter-century ago, and no threat looms larger in the Baltic states than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east,\" Pence said at a news conference with the three Baltic presidents. \"Under President Donald Trump, the United States stands firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense. An attack on one of us is an attack on us all.\"\n\nRussia is scheduled to hold large-scale military maneuvers with its ally Belarus next month. The U.S. army's top general in Europe stated this month that the Zapad war games could be a \"Trojan horse,\" potentially resulting in military equipment being left in Belarus. The general warned that Russia continues to \"seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine democracies of sovereign nations, and divide the free nations of Europe, one against another.\"\n\nLithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite told Lithuanian radio that NATO's air-policing missions would be doubled during the Russian-led Zapad exercise. Pence is also due to visit Montenegro, NATO's newest member, and make a stop in Georgia, an aspiring member, which fought a brief war with Russia in 2008.",
    " Title: Unscripted Speech by Clint Eastwood at the Republican National Convention Causes Stir\n\nArticle:\n\nThe unscripted and seemingly improvised speech delivered by actor Clint Eastwood during the Republican National Convention has become a topic of discussion on social media and cable news, overshadowing the usual post-convention analysis that the Romney campaign had hoped to benefit from. The speech, which was described as \"strange,\" \"weird,\" and \"theater of the absurd\" by Romney's advisers, left Ann Romney and other top aides unsettled.\n\nIn the speech, Eastwood, 82, engaged in a seemingly one-sided conversation with an invisible President Obama, sitting next to him. The speech was a departure from the usual scripted speeches at the convention, with Eastwood misstating the number of unemployed people and making other off-the-cuff remarks.\n\nThe Romney campaign had kept Eastwood's role a secret, listing his slot as \"to be announced\" on the public schedule. As the last night of the convention approached, planners tried to keep the actor's appearance under wraps, hoping it would be a pleasant surprise. However, his name leaked out on the internet, and his speech became a topic of speculation.\n\nEastwood's speech was scheduled for about five minutes but lasted more than twice as long, throwing off the schedule for Mitt Romney. The actor, who is generally liked and respected in Hollywood, is known for his disdain for teleprompters and chose not to use one during the speech.\n\nThe Romney campaign has not commented on the internal decision-making process regarding Eastwood's speech. However, it is known that Eastwood asked for a chair backstage at the last minute and stayed onstage for an extended period, causing a delay in the convention's schedule.\n\nThe reaction to Eastwood's speech has been mixed, with some praising it as bold and others criticizing it as a waste of a prime-time slot that could have been used for other speakers or the biographical video of Mitt Romney's life. Eastwood's next film, \"Trouble With the Curve,\" is set for release on September 21.\n\nEastwood's manager, Leonard Hirshan, said the actor does these things for himself and believes in what he is doing. Hirshan also mentioned that he had heard a chorus of response since the speech, divided evenly between those supportive and those critical.",
    " Title: President Trump Criticizes Rep. Thomas Massie for Threatening to Delay Coronavirus Relief Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump criticized Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) for his intention to demand a recorded vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The potential vote could delay the bill's passage, leading to additional costs and potential danger for workers and small businesses.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"Looks like a third-rate grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity. He can\u2019t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous and costly.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump stated, \"Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn\u2019t their fault. It is \u201cHELL\u201d dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the \u201cbig picture\u201d done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party!\"\n\nRepresentative Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) expressed his displeasure with Massie's actions, stating on Twitter, \"I am jumping on the red eye tonight... thanks Massie.\"\n\nRepresentative Dean Phillips (D-MN) also criticized Massie, tweeting, \"Dear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt.\"\n\nRepresentative Gil Cisneros (D-CA) added, \"Taking a red eye tonight.\" He continued, \"The American people, small businesses, and our healthcare workers need relief now.\"\n\nThe relief bill, Phase Three of Congress's coronavirus relief effort, passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 96-0, following several days of contentious debate. The bill was initially focused on targeted relief for individuals and businesses in financial straits due to the coronavirus outbreak, but much of the disagreement centered around House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's liberal wish list, including new environmental measures and millions of dollars in funding for D.C.'s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The House is currently in session debating the relief bill.",
    " Title: Trump Adopts More Presidential Tone in Final Republican Debate Before Crucial Primaries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift towards a more presidential demeanor, Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, displayed a lack of insults, crude remarks, and the characteristic eye-rolling during the final Republican debate before next week's critical round of primaries. The debate, held in Miami, marked a more substantive and dignified performance by all four remaining candidates, helping to restore the Republican brand from the brink following a previous debate's debacle.\n\nThe debate's focus on policy, albeit in generalities, raised questions about Trump's knowledge, and he was criticized for his at-times tenuous understanding of certain issues. For instance, when asked about the Common Core education standards, Trump stated, \"Education through Washington, D.C. I do not want that,\" despite Common Core being a state-led program.\n\nTrump also maintained his stance on Islam, stating, \"I mean a lot of them [Muslims]. I mean a lot of them,\" when asked about his comment that Islam hates the United States. This statement drew criticism from fellow candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio, who emphasized the importance of presidential actions having consequences.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also delivered crisp performances, with Kasich focusing on the need for cooperation with Arab Muslim countries to defeat ISIS, and Cruz criticizing the Obama administration's opening to Cuba.\n\nThe trajectory of the Republican nomination could be significantly influenced by next Tuesday's primaries, with five states holding primaries, and two of them awarding all delegates to the winner. If Trump wins both Florida and Ohio, he will have a near-lock on the nomination. If he wins one but not the other, he will still be well on his way. If he loses both, the race will be wide open.\n\nTrump's at-times tenuous knowledge of policy has not seemed to deter his supporters, and when he is called out on loose comments during debates, he tends to press forward. In the debate, Trump also backed down on his proposed 45% tariff on Chinese goods, stating it could be less than 45%.\n\nThe debate's performance was a demonstration of Trump's negotiating style, which, if he becomes president, may take some getting used to on the world stage. However, this style has proven successful for him in both business and, so far, as a presidential candidate.\n\nIn his subdued performance on the debate stage, Trump demonstrated how style can often be more important than substance in the minds of many voters.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Meet with Obama Amidst Sequester Crisis; GOP Proposes Alternative Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for $85 billion in spending cuts, known as the sequester, approaches, Congress is scrambling to find a solution. On Wednesday, during a visit to the Capitol, President Obama briefly conversed with Hill leaders, but no significant progress was reported. Congressional leaders are set to meet with Obama at the White House on Friday.\n\nRepublicans are skeptical about the meeting, with a senior GOP aide telling CNN that it may be nothing more than a public relations effort by the president.\n\nIn response to the impending sequester, Senate Republicans are pushing a proposal that would give the president flexibility to decide where the cuts would occur. Under the GOP plan, Obama would be required to submit a list of replacement cuts to Congress by March 15, and could not cut defense by more than $42.7 billion.\n\nDemocrats are concerned that this plan would shift responsibility for the cuts onto the president's shoulders, while some critics consider it an abdication of Congress's power of the purse. Democrats are advocating for replacing much of the sequester with tax revenue from millionaires, eliminating agriculture subsidies, and reducing defense spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan next year.\n\nHowever, Republicans are virtually unified in opposing any new taxes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) are believed to be unable to pull off a deal due to the 60-vote threshold in the 100-member chamber.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has suspended the use of military aircraft for official travel by House members, as Congress is required to reduce its own expenses.\n\nIn a separate development, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia) accused the administration of releasing undocumented workers with criminal records due to the looming cuts. The administration, however, maintains that the decision to release certain undocumented workers was made by career employees without White House input.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Rules Out House Passage of Senate Immigration Bill, Pursues Own Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner has declared that the House will not pass the Senate's immigration bill, instead opting to debate and pass its own legislation. In a joint statement with top House Republican leaders, they expressed their commitment to addressing the broken immigration system but emphasized the House's intention to produce its own legislation through regular order.\n\nThe Republican leaders' statement aims to counter the momentum behind the Senate bill, which passed a bipartisan 13-5 vote in a committee this week. The House GOP's stance is part of a political chess game between Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers works on a comprehensive immigration deal that includes legal status for illegal immigrants and a rewrite of the legal immigration system.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat and part of the bipartisan group, stated that a bipartisan bill in the House has the best chance of passing and producing a good immigration reform proposal when conferenced with the Senate's bipartisan bill.\n\nBoehner has also given the green light for two committees to work on specific aspects of the immigration bill. The Homeland Security Committee has already approved a border security bill, and the Judiciary Committee is preparing to move on legislation creating an agriculture guest-worker program and another bill to establish a nationwide electronic verification system for businesses to check their workers' legal status.\n\nThe House's approach differs from the Senate bill, which rewrites the legal immigration system and extends quick legal status to illegal immigrants with a pathway to citizenship. Democrats argue that citizenship rights are non-negotiable, while Republicans are still grappling with this issue.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has announced that he will put the immigration bill on the Senate floor next month. Key Senate Republicans have stated that they will not attempt to filibuster to block the bill from coming to the Senate floor. There is speculation that if a bill emerges from the Senate, Democrats may call on the House to pass it as well. The House Republican statement appears to be an attempt to shut down this avenue.\n\nThe leaders stated, \"Enacting policy as consequential and complex as immigration reform demands that both chambers of Congress engage in a robust debate and amendment process.\"\n\nOne issue holding up the bipartisan House negotiations on immigration is the insistence on creating a nationwide electronic verification system to check workers' legal status. Pelosi stated, \"If E-Verify is not effectively accomplished in five years, then all of these people revert to the status they have now. I think that's pretty drastic.\" However, she denied reports that she was insisting on broader health care coverage for illegal immigrants. Pelosi accepted the decision in the 2010 health care law that makes them ineligible.",
    " Title: National Republicans Express Concern Over Mark Sanford's Chances in South Carolina Congressional Race\n\nArticle:\n\nMark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor, secured the Republican nomination for the state's 1st Congressional District on Tuesday, but national Republicans are not celebrating. Many privately concede that Sanford could hand a safe Republican seat to Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch.\n\nThe affair that derailed Sanford's political career is just one of his liabilities. Fellow GOP politicians do not like him, and he does not appeal to female voters. His campaign is primarily focused on seeking forgiveness for his transgressions from four years ago, which makes it challenging to take the offensive against Colbert Busch.\n\nThe concern among national Republicans that Colbert Busch could win the 1st Congressional District seat is so real that they are prepared to invest significant resources to help Sanford, including pouring money into the race. However, Sanford's forces will find it difficult to outraise Colbert Busch, as her brother, Stephen Colbert, is actively fundraising for her campaign.\n\nOne national GOP official stated, \"This race is by no means a slam dunk for Republicans. If anyone says they know how this race is going to play out, they're kidding themselves.\"\n\nOperatives from both parties agree that the race is Sanford's to lose. The district is solid Republican territory, and Sanford, despite his flaws, is a skilled retail politician who is widely known. While Colbert Busch's campaign quickly labeled Sanford as untrustworthy and anti-woman on Tuesday night, Sanford framed the general election as a clash of ideologies between a small government conservative and a pro-union liberal.\n\nHowever, polling already shows Sanford in a tight race, and several warning signs for Sanford cannot be ignored:\n\n* Not a single member of the South Carolina congressional delegation has endorsed Sanford, an indication of his weak standing among his potential Washington colleagues. Two House Republicans backed one of Sanford's primary rivals. GOP leaders are struggling to get the delegation on board now that he has defeated former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic in the runoff.\n* Particular attention will be paid to popular Sen. Tim Scott, whose appointment to the Senate triggered the race for his House seat. Scott has remained neutral in the race, but national Republicans will want him to endorse Sanford.\n* In 2009, Scott, then a state representative, signed a letter calling on Sanford to resign. The ex-governor opted to serve out his term.\n* Sanford's actions \"reveal a pattern of poor decision making and questionable leadership,\" read the letter. \"Unless major changes are made, South Carolina will find itself perpetually sidetracked by the disarray that you have brought upon our state.\"",
    " Title: E.W. Jackson, Virginia's Republican Lieutenant Governor Nominee, Compares Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan\n\nArticle:\n\nE.W. Jackson, the newly-nominated Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Virginia, has drawn criticism for past comments comparing Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan and accusing African-Americans of having a \"slavish devotion\" to the Democratic Party.\n\nIn a self-produced video posted on YouTube last year, Jackson, an African-American pastor and attorney from Chesapeake, made the comments in a message to black Christians. He stated, \"The Democrat Party has created an unholy alliance between certain so-called civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, which has killed unborn black babies by the tens of millions. Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was.\"\n\nDemocrats have seized on these remarks and others in an attempt to tie Jackson to the rest of the Republican ticket in Virginia, particularly conservative gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. The two will face Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, in the November election.\n\n\"Extremely divisive rhetoric from Jackson and Cuccinelli reflects the social agenda they would impose on Virginia,\" McAuliffe campaign spokesman Brennan Bilberry said in a statement. \"At a time when Virginians are looking for leaders who focus on jobs, the Tea Party has nominated a ticket whose careers have been defined by a radical social agenda.\"\n\nCuccinelli and Jackson were nominated at Saturday's GOP convention in Richmond, where Jackson beat out six other candidates for the number two spot on the ticket. Party activists tapped Mark Obenshain to be their nominee for attorney general.\n\nJackson, the founder of a nondenominational church, is a former Marine and graduate of Harvard Law School. However, he is rapidly becoming known for a series of controversial statements that have surfaced online following his surprise victory on Saturday. He has publicly questioned President Barack Obama's faith and has been spearheading efforts to recruit black Democrats to the GOP since last year, when he unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Virginia.\n\nIn the same video, Jackson said, \"Shame on us for allowing ourselves to be sold to the highest bidder. We belong to God.\" He also stated, \"Our ancestors were sold against their will centuries ago, but we're going through the slave market voluntarily today.\"\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Jackson would hold the tie-breaking vote in the currently evenly divided state Senate. Republicans currently hold the lieutenant governorship and control of the 40-seat body. However, with the unpolished Jackson as the GOP nominee, Democrats are now a safe bet to pick up the lieutenant governor's office and control of the senate.\n\nDemocrats will decide their nominee in a June 11 primary. The decision to nominate candidates at a convention instead of a primary gave a relatively small group of conservative activists control over the nomination process, causing frustration among establishment Republicans.\n\nVirginia is considered a purple state, currently having a Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, but voting for Obama in the last two presidential elections. Poll numbers so far show neither party with a significant lead in the race, less than six months before Election Day. Because Virginia voters elect the governor and lieutenant governor separately, it's possible that the winners could be from different parties.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Sensitivity and Lack of Progress on Gun Control Following Congressional Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the shooting of several congressional members at a Virginia park baseball diamond, the usual rhythm of gun control debates on Capitol Hill seems to be subsiding. After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 and the Orlando LGBT Pulse Nightclub shooting in 2016, there were calls for stricter background checks and limitations on ammunition, as well as demands for a vote on purchasing access for people on the no-fly and terror watch lists.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the recent shooting, the tone has been noticeably different. While a few Democrats reverted to familiar gun control talking points, the majority of lawmakers appeared to show sensitivity and refrained from engaging in policy debates with their colleagues. There seems to be a resignation that both parties are entrenched in their positions, and little, if any, progress can be made on the federal level.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who led filibusters last summer and has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun laws since the Sandy Hook tragedy in his state, expressed dismay and frustration. He wrote on his Facebook page that he was concerned about the country's quick return to \"business as usual\" after such tragic events.\n\nFormer New York congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, who was one of the most persistent and determined Democrats on the issue during her nine terms in office, also expressed disappointment. McCarthy's husband was fatally shot in 1993 during a shooting rampage on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train outside New York City.\n\nMcCarthy argued that discussing policies after a shooting was still seen as politicizing a tragedy, and she lamented that the issue rarely received attention when there was no mass shooting. She suggested that Democrats were less likely to push the issue if they aimed to take back the majority of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterms.\n\nIn contrast, it was Republicans who suggested policy solutions after the shooting. Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), who was at the practice during the shooting, suggested that having more people with guns on the scene would have been beneficial. Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) spoke about a bill he introduced in March that would make it easier for people to carry a gun and \"allow the most law-abiding among us to defend themselves.\"\n\nCarolyn McCarthy, despite expressing some satisfaction with the bipartisan approach and the calming of political rhetoric, also sounded disappointed with the lack of progress on the issue. \"Towards the end of my career, I thought, 'Could we stop praying for everybody who gets shot or injured and just do something about it?' That is how frustrated you get, and I know most victims feel the same way,\" she said.",
    " Title: Rep. Chris Collins Suspends Re-election Bid Amid Insider Trading Charges, Remains on November Ballot\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican congressman, has suspended his re-election bid in the 27th Congressional District due to insider trading charges. The suspension aims to prevent Democrats from electing a pro-impeachment candidate in the district, as stated in a tweet by Collins on Saturday.\n\nUnder New York state law, a candidate's name cannot be replaced on a ballot this close to the election unless they die, move out of the state, or are nominated for another office. Collins, who has held the upstate New York seat since 2012, said Democrats are \"laser focused\" on taking back the House and launching impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.\n\nCollins was arrested on insider trading charges and lying to federal agents on Wednesday. He and his co-defendants, including his son Cameron and Stephen Zarsky, the father of Cameron's fianc\u00e9e, pleaded not guilty when they were arraigned in federal court. Bail for each defendant was set at $500,000, and a status hearing is scheduled for October 11.\n\nCollins is accused of receiving inside information about negative clinical trial tests conducted by Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian biotech company with which he has long been associated. He then is accused of passing that information on to his son, prompting the son and others to sell 1.78 million Innate shares before the bad news was made public in June 2017, and the share price plummeted. Those others included Cameron Collins' fianc\u00e9e, Lauren Zarsky, her mother, Dorothy, and other friends and family members. They avoided losses of $768,600, according to the complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBill Reilich, chairman of the Monroe County GOP, said county leaders in the district are evaluating \"several highly qualified individuals\" as potential replacement candidates. To comply with state law to remove Collins from the ballot, he could be nominated to a town clerk position in his district, which wouldn't necessarily require him to live within the town. He would likely be nominated on a third-party line to reduce his chances of winning a position he doesn't want to hold.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Saturday that Collins' announcement was \"insufficient and overdue\" and called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to demand Collins' resignation. \"No person is above the law, not the President or his first supporter in Congress,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nCollins, who was the first member of the House to back Trump in the 2016 election and seconded his presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention, said he will \"fill out the remaining few months\" of his term to support Trump's agenda. Collins has stated that he will \"continue to fight the meritless charges\" and looks forward to clearing his name of wrongdoing.",
    " Title: Republican Chances of Senate Control Decrease as Democrats Gain Momentum in Key States, According to Nate Silver\n\nArticle:\n\nThe likelihood of the Republican Party capturing the Senate has significantly diminished, as the fortunes of Democrats in crucial states have improved, according to Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com. The former New York Times statistician currently estimates the Republican odds at 55%, a drop from 64% just two weeks ago.\n\nSilver's detailed statistical model suggests that Democrats now have a stronger chance of winning due to shifts in the Senate races in Colorado and North Carolina, where the party now holds an advantage, a position that was previously held by the Republicans. Silver classifies these two states as \"highly competitive purple states,\" along with Iowa, Michigan, and New Hampshire. All five seats are currently held by Democrats, with the exception of New Hampshire.\n\nSilver points to numerous recent polls showing a surge for North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall as evidence of the Democrat momentum. He notes that this Democrat surge in purple states has occurred despite a deterioration in the Democrats' position on the generic congressional ballot, which is often considered the best indicator of the nation's mood.\n\nSilver also suggests that the influence of money in these races could be a factor, citing massive financial advantages for the Democrats in North Carolina and Colorado, as well as higher outside spending by Democratic-leaning super PACs.\n\n\"Whatever the reason, the GOP's path to a Senate majority is less robust than before,\" Silver concludes.",
    " Title: Clinton Foundation Announces New Donation Policy Ahead of Potential Email Leaks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to reports suggesting a potential hack of the Clinton Foundation, the embattled organization, led by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, announced on Thursday that, if Clinton is elected, her foundation will no longer accept foreign and corporate donations at the center of the Clinton Cash scandal.\n\nThe new pledge, while a tacit admission of wrongdoing, comes after years of criticism and raises questions about the foundation's past practices. The primary question being, if it would be wrong for Hillary Clinton's foundation to accept foreign cash as president, why wasn't it wrong for her foundation to accept foreign donations from oligarchs and countries with business pending on her desk as Secretary of State?\n\nFurthermore, if Hillary Clinton has been confirmed to have violated her ethics pledge with the Obama administration to disclose all Clinton Foundation donations, why should the American people believe she would now honor a new pledge to forgo foreign and corporate donations?\n\nAccording to reports by Bloomberg and the Washington Post, Hillary Clinton's foundation has yet to reveal 1,100 foreign donations, and as Clinton Cash revealed, other hidden foreign donations include four totaling $2.35 million from Ian Telfer, the former head of one of the Russian government's uranium companies, Uranium One.\n\nThis week, Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe to discover why the Obama Department of Justice blocked multiple FBI field office requests to investigate the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Cash documentary has now been viewed well over three million times.\n\nHowever, pressing broader questions remain unanswered, questions national mainstream media have heretofore been afraid to ask Hillary Clinton about the most glaring and vast series of conflicts of interest in modern American politics.\n\nHillary Clinton has not answered why her State Department approved the transfer of 20% of all U.S. uranium to Russia while not disclosing to the Obama administration that nine investors in that uranium deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHillary Clinton has not answered why her brother, Tony Rodham, sat on the board of a company that received a rare \"gold exploitation permit\" from the Haitian government while she was dispersing billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in Haiti earthquake disaster relief.\n\nHillary Clinton has not answered why she hid $2.35 million in Clinton Foundation donations from the head of one of the Russian government's uranium companies.\n\nHillary Clinton has not answered why she has yet to release the names of the 1,100 foreign Clinton Foundation donors that both Bloomberg and the Washington Post confirm remain secret.\n\nHillary Clinton has not answered why it was appropriate for Bill Clinton to deliver a $500,000 speech in Moscow paid for by a Kremlin-backed bank while she led the so-called Russian reset as Secretary of State\u2014a Clinton Cash revelation so egregious, that even the progressive New Yorker magazine was left to ponder, \"Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?\"\n\nHillary Clinton has not answered why her current campaign chairman, John Podesta, sat on the board of a company alongside Russian officials that received $35 million from Rusnano, Vladimir Putin's funding apparatus.\n\nHillary Clinton has not answered whether her husband will stop giving paid speeches.\n\nMyriad questions have gone unasked and unanswered about the toxic brew of foreign cash and Hillary Clinton's State Department decisions. Perhaps now, with this stunning new tacit admission of unethical and inappropriate behavior by Hillary Clinton and her foundation, will the mainstream media find the spine to do the hard work of investigative reporting and the courage to demand serious answers.",
    " Title: Philippines Imposes Travel Restrictions on U.S. Lawmakers, Threatens Tighter Entry Rules for U.S. Citizens\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Philippines has announced a travel ban for two U.S. lawmakers and potential tighter entry restrictions for U.S. citizens in response to potential U.S. sanctions over the detention of Senator Leila de Lima. President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman, Salvador Panelo, made the announcement during a news conference on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. Congress approved a 2020 budget that contains a provision introduced by Senators Richard Durbin and Patrick Leahy against anyone involved in holding de Lima, who was charged with drug offenses in 2017 after she led an investigation into mass killings during Duterte's war on drugs.\n\nIn response, Duterte will impose visa requirements on U.S. nationals should any Philippine officials involved in de Lima's incarceration be denied entry to the United States. The Philippines currently grants visa-free entry for up to 30 days to Americans, with nearly 13% of foreign arrivals being U.S. citizens, according to data from the first nine months of 2019.\n\nPanelo stated, \"We will not sit idly if they continue to interfere with our processes as a sovereign state.\" The U.S. embassy in Manila and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. David Carle, spokesman for Senator Leahy, called the charges against de Lima politically motivated and added, \"This is about the right of Filipino citizens - and people everywhere - to freely express their opinions, including opinions that may be critical of government policies that involve the use of excessive force and the denial of due process.\"\n\nPanelo described travel restrictions over de Lima's detention as \"nonsense\" because she is not wrongfully imprisoned but detained pending trial for crimes. He stated, \"The case of Senator de Lima is not one of persecution but of prosecution.\"\n\nDuterte has expressed his disdain for the United States and what he considers its hypocrisy and interference, though he admits that most Filipinos and his military have high regard for their country's former colonial ruler. The United States is the Philippines' biggest defense ally, and millions of Filipinos have relatives who are U.S. citizens.\n\nDe Lima, a justice minister in a former administration, has won numerous awards from human rights groups, who consider her a prisoner of conscience. She has called for an international investigation into Duterte's war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed. Police say those killed were drug dealers who resisted arrest, but activists say many of the killings were murders.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Post-Denver Debate Strategy: Six Keys to a Potential Revival\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's successful debate performance in Denver last week has left him with a significant challenge: maintaining momentum and demonstrating that his victory was not a fluke. To genuinely alter the race's trajectory, Romney must execute a series of strategic moves in the coming days.\n\n1. Consistent Performance: Romney must demonstrate that his Denver performance accurately reflects his abilities and that the weaknesses he exposed in President Barack Obama are not isolated incidents.\n\n2. Obama's Response: The president has expressed dissatisfaction with his own debate performance and is expected to improve at the next debate. A strong Obama debate performance, particularly if contrasted with a merely adequate one by Romney, could bring the race back to its pre-Denver state.\n\n3. Higher Expectations: Romney will be judged by higher expectations, not just as a credible alternative, but as a candidate capable of proposing a forward-looking agenda.\n\n4. Emotional Connection: Romney has been showcasing a more emotive, connected side of himself at rallies since the debate. This not only provides practice for the town hall-style format at Hofstra University but also allows him to connect with voters on a personal level.\n\n5. Preparation: Romney is taking his debate preparation seriously, and this discipline, combined with his recent experience, may make a clear Obama victory unlikely.\n\n6. Perception of a Downward Spiral: A clear Obama loss could invite perceptions of a decline in the incumbent's strength, significantly increasing the odds of a Romney presidency.\n\nIn the coming days, Romney's strategy will be crucial in determining the outcome of the presidential race.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes New Immigration Laws: A Look at the Raise Act and Its Potential Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled a new immigration bill on Wednesday, titled the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (Raise) Act. The legislation, co-sponsored by Republican senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, aims to reduce the total number of immigrants admitted to the United States by half over a decade and prioritize those who can speak English or are well-educated.\n\nThe Raise Act, presented at the White House, would cap the number of refugees admitted annually at 50,000 and eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which currently allocates 50,000 visas a year to residents of countries that do not currently send significant numbers of migrants to the US.\n\nAccording to an estimate provided by Senator Cotton's office, if passed, the Raise Act would decrease the number of immigrants admitted to the US by 41% in its first year and by 50% over a 10-year-period.\n\nPresident Trump described the bill as \"legislation that would represent the most significant reform to our immigration system in a half century\" and as the fulfillment of his campaign promise to create a \"merit-based immigration system that protects American workers and taxpayers.\"\n\nTrump has long been vocal about illegal immigration, making a border wall with Mexico his signature campaign policy. However, he has also advocated for revamping legal immigration. In his February address to Congress, the president called for \"reforming our system of legal immigration\" and shifting to a merit-based system, citing Canada and Australia as models.\n\nSenator Cotton, from Arkansas, echoed Trump's rhetoric, making a populist case for his legislation. He argued that the current immigration system shows \"we're not committed to working-class Americans\" and puts \"great downward pressure on people who work with their hands and feet.\" Cotton and Perdue first introduced the bill in February.\n\nDespite Trump's support, the legislation has bipartisan detractors and is unlikely to pass Congress in its current form. While Republicans have long been united on the issue of illegal immigration, legal immigration is far more divisive for them. Many pro-business Republicans have long supported legal immigration, and the new legislation is likely to stoke the divides between this wing of the party and more populist Republicans.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent critic of Trump, denounced the proposed reduction in legal immigration, stating it would \"be devastating to [South Carolina's] economy, which relies on this immigrant workforce.\"\n\nFor the Democrats, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer told reporters the proposal to cut legal immigration \"doesn't make much sense\" and said his party would not support the plan. \"This is different than illegal immigration,\" Schumer said. \"This creates jobs in America. This helps America, and we think it's a non-starter.\"\n\nLater, a heated exchange occurred between White House aide Stephen Miller and CNN anchor Jim Acosta during a discussion about the policy. Acosta asked Miller if the proposal would violate the spirit of the poem New Colossus, inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty, which includes the line: \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nThe White House criticized Acosta for his \"cosmopolitan bias\" and attacked him for asking about what the bill would do to the racial composition of immigrants to the United States by saying: \"That is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant and foolish things you've ever said.\"\n\nMiller later apologized to Acosta before leaving the lectern \"if things got heated\" but added that the CNN anchor \"made some pretty rough insinuations.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Approval Rating Stays Steady Amidst Controversies, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington (CNN) - President Barack Obama concludes a week marked by controversy with his approval rating remaining steady, according to a new national poll by CNN/ORC International. The poll, released Sunday, indicates that congressional Republicans may not be overplaying their hand in their response to the three ongoing scandals that have dominated the nation's capital over the past week and a half.\n\nThe poll, conducted Friday and Saturday, shows that 53% of Americans approve of the job the president is doing, while 45% disapprove. This is a two-point increase from CNN's last poll, conducted in early April. However, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland notes that this difference is within the poll's sampling error, and should not be characterized as a gain for the president.\n\nThe poll's findings align with Gallup's, which also indicates a slight rise in Obama's approval rating over the same time period. Both surveys show a very slight upward movement in the president's approval rating over the past week, but within their respective sampling errors.\n\nThe poll reveals that more than seven in ten Americans find the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of tea party and other conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status unacceptable. While both parties in Congress and the White House are criticizing the IRS actions, congressional Republicans are portraying the controversy as a case of the federal government gone wild.\n\nHowever, more than six in ten say that the president's statements about the IRS scandal are completely or mostly true, with 35% not agreeing with Obama's characterizations. Regarding the IRS's actions, 55% say the IRS acted on its own, while 37% say the White House ordered the IRS to target tea party and other conservative groups.\n\nRegarding the September attack in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, only 42% are satisfied with the Obama administration's handling of the situation. Fifty-three percent are dissatisfied, but these numbers are virtually unchanged from November.\n\nRepublicans have criticized the administration for inadequate security, a botched response, and misleading the public for political gain, as the attack occurred less than two months before the 2012 presidential election. According to the poll, 44% say the administration's statements soon after the attack were an attempt to intentionally mislead the public, while half say those statements reflected what the administration believed had occurred at the time.\n\nHowever, 59% now say that the U.S. government could have prevented the Benghazi attack, a 11-point increase from November. Additionally, only 37% say that congressional Republicans are overreacting in their handling of the matter, with 59% saying they've reacted appropriately.\n\nThe White House has also faced criticism for the Justice Department's secret collection of phone records from the Associated Press as part of a government investigation into classified leaks. According to the poll, 52% say the Justice Department's actions were unacceptable, while 43% disagree.\n\nAmericans appear to be taking all three controversies very seriously, with 55% saying the IRS and Benghazi matters are very important to the nation, and 53% saying the same about the AP case.\n\n\"More Republicans than Democrats or Independents say these three issues are very important to the nation, but even among Democrats, nearly half say the matters are very serious,\" Holland adds.\n\nOnly 43% say they have a great deal or some confidence in the people who run the federal government. However, 56% say they have a great deal or some confidence in the system of government.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by ORC International between May 17-18, with 923 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.",
    " Title: Republican Debate Elevates Tension Among Candidates Ahead of Super Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final Republican primary debate before Super Tuesday, held on Thursday, displayed a level of hostility and discord not previously seen in the party's debates. The event, moderated by CNN's Wolf Blitzer, featured a significant shift in the dynamic between candidates Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nFor the first time in ten debates and six months, Rubio and Cruz focused their attacks on Trump, criticizing his record, character, and policy platform. Rubio, in a memorable moment, described Trump's campaign slogan as \"Everyone's dumb, he's going to make America great again. Win, win, win.\"\n\nWith nearly half of the delegates needed to secure the nomination at stake, and Trump still leading in most states, it remains uncertain whether the debate's chaotic atmosphere will propel either candidate into the lead. Rubio, armed with a series of comebacks and quick responses to Trump's familiar insults, seemed to employ tactics learned from the Trump Academy of the Dramatic Arts, rolling his eyes, waving his hands, and appearing more human than his previous \"Marco Roboto\" persona.\n\nGlenn Beck, a Cruz supporter, praised Rubio's performance, reviving hopes that Trump might not run away with the nomination. However, Trump continued to employ the same talking points against Rubio and Cruz, escalating the vitriol. Rubio was now portrayed as a \"sweaty-faced choke artist\" instead of an inexperienced young man who repeated himself, while Cruz was no longer just a \"liar\" who allegedly screwed over Ben Carson in Iowa, but a \"basket case\" and a \"crazy zealot.\" Cruz retaliated by suggesting Trump should \"get back on [his] meds.\"\n\nThe debate marked a significant escalation in the Republican primary race, with the candidates' personal attacks and heated exchanges potentially impacting the outcome of Super Tuesday and the overall nomination process.",
    " Title: House Republican Health Care Bill Faces Uncertain Future as Vote Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican-backed health care bill, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), is facing uncertainty as it approaches a vote in the House of Representatives. The White House expressed optimism on Friday that the bill would pass, despite speculation that it may not have enough support for an afternoon vote.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are meeting to discuss the way forward on the bill. According to GOP lawmakers and congressional aides, House Republican leaders are short of the votes needed for the bill to pass.\n\nIn an effort to coax support from conservatives, House leaders proposed a fresh amendment that would repeal the requirement that insurers cover 10 specified services like maternity and mental health care. This amendment is in response to demands from conservatives who argue that these conditions drive up premiums.\n\nPresident Trump met with members of the Freedom Caucus on Thursday in an attempt to win them over. However, the vote was postponed after administration officials fell short. Trump issued an ultimatum on Thursday night, stating that the House should vote on the legislation to begin dismantling ObamaCare on Friday, and if it fails, he is \"done with health care\" and ready to move on to tax reform.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy thinks the vote will wrap up by 4:30 or 5 p.m. ET. If the bill passes, it will be a monumental achievement for Speaker Ryan and Trump. However, if the bill stumbles, recriminations will abound.\n\nThe House Rules Committee is expected to prepare the health care bill starting at 7 a.m. ET on Friday. The timing of the vote is uncertain, with McCarthy telling reporters that the House should be \"done in the afternoon,\" but noting that Democrats could delay things.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump met with the Freedom Caucus to try and rally conservatives to the cause. He also tweeted, urging supporters to call their representatives to back the bill. A senior administration official told reporters after the meeting with Trump and the conservative group that there was a deal in the works, but that it was not yet finalized. A source from the Freedom Caucus later said there was not yet a deal.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters after meeting with Republican leaders that they have been promising the American people that they will repeal and replace the broken law for seven and a half years. \"Tomorrow we're proceeding,\" he said.\n\nIn appealing to conservatives with concessions that include limiting requirements that plans offer benefits including maternity and substance abuse care, Republican leaders risk scaring off moderates. A plan to cut funding to Planned Parenthood also risks spooking centrist Republicans.\n\nDemocrats blasted what they saw as Republicans' amateurish maneuvering. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was a \"rookie's error\" to bring the legislation to a vote so early, and urged fellow Democrats to oppose the legislation.",
    " Title: President Trump Welcomes Home Three Americans Released by North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump welcomed home three American citizens who had been detained by North Korea on Thursday at Joint Base Andrews. The three released prisoners landed at the Maryland military facility at 2:42 a.m., where they were greeted by President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, their respective wives, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe three men, identified as Kim Dong Chul, Kim Sang-duk (also known as Tony Kim), and Kim Hak-song, are Korean-Americans. North Korea had accused them of anti-state activities. After arriving, the prisoners were taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for further evaluation and medical treatment.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo had secured the release of the men during a Wednesday trip to North Korea. He arrived at Andrews minutes earlier on his own plane. The release is seen as a further sign of thawing relations between the U.S. and North Korea, following Kim's pledge last month to suspend missile tests and close a nuclear test site.\n\nHowever, the release comes amid renewed uncertainty regarding the upcoming summit between Trump and Kim, following Trump's decision earlier this week to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. Pompeo's trip to Pyongyang was scheduled to coincide with Trump's decision to remove the U.S. from the Iran agreement.\n\nPlans for a meeting between Trump and Kim mark a significant shift in the relationship between the two leaders, who exchanged threats and insults across the Pacific Ocean last summer. A meeting between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea would be a historic first. Pompeo's first visit to North Korea over Easter weekend marked the first known meeting between a U.S. official and a North Korean leader since then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father, in 2000.\n\n\"My proudest achievement will be when we denuclearize that entire peninsula,\" Trump said. \"This is what people have been waiting a long time for. I'm very honored to free the three folks. The true honor is going to be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTrump predicted that his planned meeting with Kim would be \"a very big success\" and suggested that his relationship with the North Korean leader is \"starting off on a new footing.\" Asked if he might visit North Korea, Trump responded \"it could happen.\"\n\n\"I really think he wants to do something. I think he did this because I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world. I really believe that,\" Trump said.\n\nThe ex-detainees thanked Trump for securing their freedom in a statement released by the State Department on their behalf. One spoke briefly with reporters through a translator, stating that the three prisoners \"were treated in many different ways\" and that he had been forced to do hard labor but also received medical treatment when he was sick. Their release, he said, is \"like a dream we are very, very happy.\"\n\n\"We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,\" the former prisoners said in their statement. \"We thank God, and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return. God Bless America, the greatest nation in the world.\"",
    " Title: Tillerson Warns of 'Serious Mistrust' Between U.S. and Russia Over Election Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has warned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of \"serious mistrust\" between the two nations due to Moscow's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. Tillerson made these remarks on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in the Philippines.\n\nTillerson stated that Russia's actions had damaged the relationship, but added it was not \"useful to just cut everything off over one single issue.\" He also mentioned that the U.S. will respond by September 1 to Russia's expulsion of 755 staff from the U.S. embassy in Moscow.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies believe the Kremlin attempted to help President Donald Trump during the election, a claim Moscow vehemently denies. The tit-for-tat between the two nations escalated after Congress passed sanctions against Russia last month, against President Trump's wishes.\n\nTillerson told Lavrov that there was now \"serious mistrust between our two countries and that we simply have to find some way to deal with that.\" He also indicated that the two countries may be able to come together to begin discussions on violence in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe comments by the former CEO of Exxon Mobil come less than a week after President Trump signed into law new legislation that imposes sanctions on Russia for election meddling and military actions in Crimea and Ukraine. The law also prevents Trump from lifting sanctions or returning Russian diplomatic compounds in the U.S. seized by the Obama administration in retaliation for the alleged meddling.\n\nPresident Trump has failed to singularly point the finger at Moscow for the hacking of Democratic Party emails during the final stages of the election campaign. He has also condemned the investigations, which are also looking at whether his campaign team colluded with Moscow, as a \"witch hunt.\" After signing the bill, Mr. Trump decried it, arguing that it limited his ability to negotiate with Russia.",
    " Title: Central American Migrants Seek U.S. Asylum in Increasing Numbers, Citing Obama's DACA Program\n\nArticle:\n\nA surge in Central American families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and seeking asylum has led to overcrowded detention facilities and the release of some migrants with a promise to report to immigration officials at a later date. Edilberto Lanza Mejia, a 26-year-old Honduran, is one such individual who was released at a bus station in McAllen, Texas, after being detained for five days.\n\nAccording to The Houston Chronicle, Lanza and his family crossed the border five days prior, but with large groups of 80 to 90 people asking border agents to arrest them daily, the system has been overwhelmed. There is reportedly no space to house everyone until their cases can be adjudicated, so the Border Patrol is releasing them with the expectation that they will voluntarily report to immigration officials weeks later.\n\nWithin hours of arriving, Lanza borrowed a cellphone in the bus terminal, and his wife called her sister in North Carolina, who paid for their fare to Greenville. They had tickets for the last bus out that night, leaving at 11:30 p.m.\n\nThe Obama administration claims that the influx of families coming to Texas is due to recent violence in Central American countries. However, The Christian Science Monitor reports that the flow of unaccompanied minors crossing the border illegally has been steady for over a decade.\n\nFrom fiscal year 2012 to 2014, the federal government agency responsible for caring for unaccompanied minors who cross the border illegally dealt with an average of 7,000 to 8,000 cases a year. In fiscal year 2011, the number was 6,560, but it jumped to 13,625 in the following year. This fiscal year, which ends on September 30, 2014, federal officials are estimating that the number could be 80,000.\n\nThe increase in unaccompanied minors crossing the border in 2012 coincides with the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows some undocumented immigrants who came to America as minors to defer deportation for two years. Last week, the administration announced guidelines for how these immigrants could defer deportation for a further two years.\n\nThe DACA program's arbitrary age and cutoff date limits have been criticized as illogical and morally questionable. When DACA was first announced, PBS NewsHour's Jeffrey Brown pressed President Obama's director of domestic policy, Cecilia Munoz, about the age limit, asking why someone whose age is 31, who has spent many years in the United States and gone to school or had a job or served in the military, would not be eligible. Munoz responded that the cutoff date in the legislation passed by the House of Representatives in 2010 was age 30.\n\nThe DREAM Act's age 30 cutoff and the DACA program's arbitrary cutoff dates have been criticized as illogical and morally questionable. Critics argue that there is no moral or logical reason to reward those who entered the country before a certain date and punish those who did not enter soon enough.\n\nCentral American migrants appear to be aware of the inconsistencies in U.S. immigration policy, with some viewing the DACA program as a pathway to stay in the United States. A recently detained undocumented immigrant from Guatemala told The Christian Science Monitor last week, \"They're saying that women and children are allowed to stay. If you make it, they take you to a shelter and take care of you and let you have permission to stay.\" A 13-year-old named Robin Tulio told The New York Times, \"When you appeal your case, if you say you want to study, they support you.\"\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry has asked President Obama to change his immigration policies, particularly the practice of releasing illegal immigrants into the United States with only a promise to appear in court. A Homeland Security official told The Houston Chronicle, \"We need a policy change so we can send these families and children back home instead of turning them loose.\"",
    " Title: Paul Manafort's Washington Meetings Conflict with Mercury's Previous Claims of No Coordination\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent disclosures filed with the Justice Department reveal that President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, participated in meetings with U.S. government officials connected to the Russia-aligned political party he was representing in 2012 and 2013. These meetings, which had not been previously disclosed, conflict with Mercury's previous claims that it did not coordinate with Manafort.\n\nAccording to the disclosures, Manafort, in conjunction with Vin Weber, a partner at the lobbying firm Mercury, met with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), former Arizona Republican Congressman Jim Kolbe of the International Republican Institute, Paula Dobriansky of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and Nadia Diuk of the National Endowment for Democracy. The lobbying effort was on behalf of a Brussels-based think tank that supported Ukraine's Party of Regions, headed at the time by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Manafort client.\n\nThe Brussels think tank, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, paid Mercury more than $1.2 million for work between May 2012 and May 2014, according to the disclosures. Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni stated, \"One meeting with one lawmaker connected to this topic in a two-year period looks like incidental contact to fair-minded Americans.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Maloni said Manafort might report his foreign lobbying activities in response to advice from authorities. Manafort, a longtime associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone, was ousted from Trump's campaign in August following revelations by The New York Times about his work in Ukraine.\n\nMercury partner Michael McKeon stated that Manafort connected his Brussels think tank client to the firm. \"Manafort referred the client to us,\" McKeon said in a statement. \"At that time, he was widely recognized for his significant experience in Ukrainian politics and we felt his perspective would be meaningful in those few meetings. That was the extent of his involvement with us.\"\n\nWeber also accompanied former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko to a meeting with then-Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) in May 2012, according to the disclosures.\n\nMercury originally reported its lobbying for the think tank to Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which doesn't require firms to itemize each interaction and expense. However, lobbying for foreign governments and political parties has to be reported to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nMercury said it relied on assurances from the think tank that it wasn't funded or controlled by a foreign political party. \"We got it in writing so we could be sure we were doing it right, and relied on our counsel to make the proper determination,\" McKeon said. While violating the disclosure law is criminal, the office that enforces it usually settles for bringing lobbyists into compliance instead of bringing charges. The other lobbying firm working for the think tank, the Podesta Group, also retroactively filed with the Justice Department earlier this month.",
    " Title: Illinois Democrats Push for Increased Abortion Access, Sparking Protests and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of protestors gathered at the Illinois state capitol in Springfield on Wednesday to voice their opposition to proposed abortion bills, which they refer to as radical new legislation. The bills aim to increase access and provision for abortion, with one bill allowing abortions up until the moment of birth for any reason and the other repealing the requirement for minors to notify their parents.\n\nDemocratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker has expressed a plan to make Illinois the most progressive state in the nation for reproductive health care, a move that pro-lifers fear will become a reality. Illinois is already seen as a safe haven for those seeking abortions, especially since a new law allows the state Medicaid program to fund them.\n\nResearchers on both sides of the debate have found that when taxpayers fund abortion, the numbers tend to increase. In 2019, 5,528 women traveled to Illinois from other states to have abortions, a significant increase from the 4,543 women who did so in 2016. The total number of statewide abortions also saw a similar increase, rising to 39,329 in 2017 from 38,382 in 2016.\n\nThe repeal of the Parent Notification of Abortion Act of 1995 could lead to an increase in the annual number of abortions. This bill, which passed out of a state Senate committee on Tuesday, will allow minors to make hasty decisions without parental consent to get an abortion.\n\nState Sen. Elgie Sims, Jr. (D-Chicago), the bill's sponsor, stated that the goal of the new bill was to increase \"authentic family conversations.\" However, State Sen. Jason Plummer (R-Edwardsville) argued against the progressive measure at the committee meeting.\n\n\"We're talking about the termination of a life, right?\" Plummer said. \"And so, for there to be maybe a hurdle or two there, I don't think as a society is necessarily the worst thing because... we're talking about the termination of a heartbeat, and that's a significant concern of mine.\"\n\nThe other bill, the Reproductive Health Act, would establish abortion as a fundamental right. The measure includes a mandatory rule for private insurance companies to cover abortion and grants physician-assistants the opportunity to perform abortions.\n\nRep. Terri Bryant (R-Murphysboro) argues that the bill has nothing to do with reproductive health. \"I feel a little bit like I've fallen through the rabbit hole,\" stated Bryant. \"Everything is upside-down, backwards and inside-out in just using the name.\"\n\nIllinois Right to Life Action reports that the bills would allow unregulated abortion up until the moment of birth for any reason and would strip away all parental rights, along with any requirement of medical certification by staff or facility. If enacted, Illinois would become a third-trimester abortion destination, and no abortion would be subject to state inspection. Since 2011, at least four abortion facilities have shut down due to failed state inspections.\n\nThe progressive measures have been introduced by Democrats in both chambers, but only the Senate is seeing success as the measure is stalled in the House.",
    " Title: Trump and Obama's Approaches to Foreign Policy Compared\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a contrasting approach to foreign policy, Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama have taken different tactics in dealing with global conflicts.\n\nPresident Obama, the 44th president and a Democrat, is known for his efforts to de-escalate the perception of Islam as a terrorist entity. This approach earned him the Nobel Peace Prize, despite the world's ongoing conflicts and the looming threat of a civilizational war, as theorized by Samuel Huntington.\n\nPresident Trump, the 45th president and an Independent Republican, has defined the enemy more accurately, but has received criticism rather than recognition. His first international trip as president has been met with media focus on trivial matters, such as the fashion choices of his wife, Melania Trump, rather than substantive discussions on American foreign policy.\n\nThe media's response to Trump has been criticized for its negative coverage, with little attention given to the substance of American foreign policy. Instead, the media has been accused of undermining the constitutional and democratic order by acting as a court-jester, megaphone, and lap-dog for politicians and civil servants with personal agendas.\n\nTrump was elected in part due to his ability to connect with voters and his commitment to addressing domestic and foreign threats to the union. His priorities have been clear, while his opponents have been criticized for their lack of clarity.\n\nIn the Middle East, the article suggests that relying on allies outside Israel is a mistake. The author argues that alliances of convenience, while cold and cynical, are necessary to maintain American power and protect American prosperity and freedoms. The Bush 43 administration recognized this early on, with the \"you're either with us or against us\" policy in the war on terror. However, the article suggests that the Bushites lost sight of this insight and instead pursued Wilsonian liberal interventionism, which aimed to promote democracy globally.\n\nTrump is now seeking to distance himself from this interventionist approach, with the goal of preserving American power while maintaining order in a world that is \"beastly, awful, and evil.\" The article concludes by expressing hope for Trump's success in his foreign policy tour, particularly in the Middle East, where the president is expected to send a clear message that the U.S. will not tolerate opposition from countries in the region.",
    " Title: YouTube Emerging as Significant Source of Health Information, but Algorithms May Exacerbate Health Literacy Disparities\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from the Health Information National Trends Survey indicates that 75% of Americans turn to the internet first when seeking health or medical information. YouTube, a popular online platform with billions of views daily, has emerged as a significant source of health information. Several public health agencies, such as state health departments, have invested resources in YouTube as a channel for health communication. Patients with chronic health conditions particularly rely on social media, including YouTube videos, to learn more about managing their conditions.\n\nHowever, video recommendations on such sites could exacerbate preexisting health literacy disparities. A significant fraction of the U.S. population is estimated to have limited health literacy, or the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Studies of health literacy, such as the National Assessment of Adult Literacy conducted in 2003, estimated that only 12% of adults had proficient health literacy skills.\n\nA professor of information systems, Anjana Susarla, has researched how social media platforms like YouTube widen such health literacy disparities by steering users toward questionable content. In a study, Susarla examined thousands of videos purporting to be about diabetes and found that the most popular and engaging videos are significantly less likely to have medically valid information.\n\nUsers typically encounter videos on health conditions through keyword searches on YouTube. YouTube then provides links to authenticated medical information, such as the top-ranked results. Several of these are produced by reputable health organizations. Recently, YouTube has adjusted how search results are displayed, allowing results to be ranked by \"relevance\" and providing links to verified medical information.\n\nHowever, when Susarla recruited physicians to watch the videos and rate them on whether these would be considered valid and understandable from a patient education perspective, they rated YouTube's recommendations poorly. The most popular videos tend to have easily understandable information but are not always medically valid. A study on the most popular videos on COVID-19 likewise found that a quarter of videos did not contain medically valid information.\n\nThis is because the algorithms' underlying recommendations on social media platforms are biased toward engagement and popularity. Based on how digital platforms provide information to search queries, a user with greater health literacy is more likely to discover usable medical advice from a reputed health care provider, such as the Mayo Clinic. The same algorithm will steer a less literate user toward fake cures or misleading medical advice.\n\nThis could be especially harmful for minority groups. Studies of health literacy in the United States have found that the impact of limited health literacy disproportionately impacts minorities. Correcting algorithmic biases and providing better information to users of technology platforms would go a long way in promoting equity.\n\nFor example, a pioneering study by the Gender Shades project examined disparities in identifying gender and skin type across different companies that provide commercial facial recognition software. It concluded that companies were able to make progress in reducing these disparities once issues were pointed out.\n\nAccording to some estimates, Google receives over a billion health questions every day. Especially those with low health literacy have a substantial risk of encountering medically unsubstantiated information, such as popular myths or active conspiracy theories that are not based on scientific evidence. The World Economic Forum has dubbed health-related misinformation an \"infodemic.\" Digital platforms where anyone can engage also make them vulnerable to misinformation, accentuating disparities in health literacy, as Susarla's work shows.\n\nSocial media and search companies have partnered with health organizations such as the Mayo Clinic to provide validated information and reduce the spread of misinformation. To make health information on YouTube more equitable, those who design recommendation algorithms would have to incorporate feedback from clinicians and patients as well as end users.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Block $84 Billion Tax Cut Bill Over Amendment Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans on Thursday blocked an $84 billion tax cut bill, marking the second time in less than a week that a procedural impasse over amendments has derailed legislation. The legislation, which aims to revive a series of expired tax breaks, failed to clear a procedural hurdle due to widespread objections from Republicans over the lack of opportunity to propose amendments, including one targeting the Obamacare medical device tax.\n\nThe vote was 53-40, with 60 votes needed to advance the measure. The dispute comes just days after a similar impasse scuttled an energy efficiency bill and a vote on the Keystone Pipeline, signaling six more months of gridlock and partisan bickering if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell cannot forge a working relationship before the November election.\n\nLawmakers are uncertain about the future of the so-called tax extenders, which would renew a variety of temporary provisions benefiting teachers, commuters, banks, and others. Some Republicans expressed hope for a brief delay, but the party's top tax writer acknowledged the move could postpone the legislation until after this year's midterm elections.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) expressed his support for the Republican stance, stating, \"Don't we care a little more about freedom and the right to bring up your amendments and the right to be a participant in the process? We've always had rights around here, and that's what's involved here, that's what the whole thing is about. It's not about trying to stop this bill\u2014it's saying, 'Look, we've had enough of this crap.'\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) criticized the Republican vote, stating, \"Republicans can't take 'yes' for an answer\u2014they just voted against the second bipartisan bill in less than a week. That's what just happened: the Republicans voted against tax cuts. So maybe the Republicans will hear from their friends down on K Street and around the country and maybe they will learn this is pretty important to everybody.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kirk of Illinois was the only Republican to side with Democrats. Lawmakers will reportedly use the weekend and the first few days of next week to negotiate an amendment deal. The GOP leadership began whipping their members to vote down the bill on Wednesday, and by Thursday's caucus lunch, Republicans had agreed to oppose Reid.\n\nRepublicans expressed little remorse about shooting down a tax cut bill. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) stated, \"Tax cuts come and go,\" while Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) expressed outrage over being \"frozen out of the process.\" Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) predicted any delay on the bill would be brief, arguing the chamber could still complete work on the bill by Memorial Day. However, if not, Coats suggested it might not make much difference because lawmakers were unlikely to finalize a plan for the tax provisions with the House until a post-election lame-duck session.",
    " Title: Congress Averts Shutdown for Now, December Showdown Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe immediate threat of a government shutdown has subsided, but the possibility of a future standoff is imminent. The U.S. Congress has managed to avoid a shutdown for now, with a short-term funding bill expected to pass this week. However, a more significant funding battle is expected in December, when lawmakers must agree on a new funding bill for the new fiscal year.\n\nThe current funding fight, initially centered around Planned Parenthood, dissipated following Speaker John Boehner's surprise resignation announcement on Friday. The House is expected to pass a short-term spending bill this week, which will fund the government through December 11 and not strip funding from Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Senate will lead the charge to prevent a shutdown, with a key procedural vote scheduled for Monday evening on the short-term spending bill. Senate Democratic and GOP leadership aides confirmed that the bill should secure the 60 votes needed to advance. After the Senate's final passage of the stopgap measure, likely by Tuesday night, the House will follow suit, and the bill will be sent to President Barack Obama for his signature, thus averting a second federal government shutdown since 2013.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of a shutdown during CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Speaker Boehner replied, \"No.\" Boehner acknowledged that he would need Democratic support for the bill but added, \"I expect my Democrat colleagues want to keep the government open as much as I do.\"\n\nInstead of focusing on the government funding, House Republicans are redirecting their energy towards investigating allegations that Planned Parenthood profited from fetal tissue sales, stemming from a series of undercover sting videos. The House GOP announced over the weekend that they will establish a select committee to probe these accusations.\n\nIn addition, the House will vote on more measures restricting abortion, and draft a reconciliation measure to defund Planned Parenthood. On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will take up a reconciliation bill that bars funding for Planned Parenthood for one year and a public health fund established under Obamacare.\n\nReconciliation is an appealing procedural tool for the GOP-controlled Congress, as it can bypass a filibuster in the Senate and send a bill directly to Obama. However, the rules for reconciliation in the Senate are more complex, and GOP leaders have not yet indicated whether they will follow suit and use the procedural tool to strip funding from Planned Parenthood.\n\nSome House conservatives were initially dissatisfied with the leadership's strategy when it was unveiled last week, pushing for a funding fight that could lead to a shutdown. However, they have since resigned themselves to the fact that a spending bill without Planned Parenthood restrictions is inevitable.\n\nDemocrats are expected to provide the majority of votes to keep the government open beyond Wednesday. Republicans oppose the stopgap measure for reasons beyond the funding for Planned Parenthood, as demonstrated last week when the Senate tried to advance a bill defunding the group, and a group of moderate and conservative Republicans voted against it.\n\nThe outcome of the December funding fight is uncertain, but the stage is set for a significant showdown over government spending priorities.",
    " Title: One Million Syrian Children Flee Violence, UN Urges Global Response\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United Nations (UN) has reported that over one million children, with three-quarters being under the age of 11, have been forced to flee violence in Syria since the conflict began in 2011. This grim figure was released by UN agencies on Friday.\n\nAnthony Lake, the executive director of UNICEF, the UN children's agency, stated, \"This one millionth child refugee is not just another number. This is a real child ripped from home, maybe even from a family, facing horrors we can only begin to comprehend.\"\n\nThe release of the statistic coincides with the UN's push for an immediate investigation of an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus. The Syrian government has denied the accusation, calling it \"illogical and fabricated,\" according to the BBC. However, unverified footage shows civilians, many of them children, suffering symptoms consistent with nerve agents, and rows of shrouded bodies, as reported by the BBC.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon renewed calls for UN inspectors to be allowed to investigate the claims immediately. \"I can think of no good reason why any party, either government or opposition forces, would decline this opportunity to get to the truth of the matter,\" the UN chief said, according to Reuters.\n\nAs the situation escalates, the UN is acting quickly, with UN's top disarmament representative, Angela Kane, set to fly to Syria to investigate the suburb where more than a thousand died in what appears to be the largest attack so far in the Syrian conflict. The UN team currently inside Syria is only authorized to investigate three of the 13 sites deemed suspicious before Wednesday's attack.\n\nSyria has become the worst refugee crisis since the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, with over 100,000 people killed since protests against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. Refugees have been fleeing to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt, and increasingly North Africa and Europe.\n\nChildren are among the most vulnerable. While 1 million have been forced to flee the violence, the UN says that 2 million others are displaced within the country. \"The youth of Syria are losing their homes, their family members, and their futures,\" said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres.\n\nEducation is a top long-term concern, as these children are part of a so-called \"lost generation\" that won't easily be able to bring stability to their country in the future. Few have been able to study or receive psychological counseling.\n\nThroughout the region, one of the biggest concerns for Syrian refugee families is finding schooling for their children, who make up 48% of the Syrian refugee population and are unable to attend official schooling in their host countries. The longer children stay out of school, the less likely they are to eventually return, according to a March report from Save the Children. In Jordan, CARE found that more than 60% of school-age children are not attending any classes, despite the availability of free schooling.\n\nOn Friday, UNICEF officials urged the international community to respond to the problem, which it says belongs to everybody. \"We must all share the shame,\" said UNICEF's Mr. Lake. \"Because while we work to alleviate the suffering of those affected by this crisis, the global community has failed in its responsibility to this child. We should stop and ask ourselves how, in all conscience, we can continue to fail the children of Syria.\"\n\nHowever, as Michael Gerson points out in The Washington Post, the response from countries has limits. The article highlights the challenges faced by those trying to help Syrian children who have been forced to leave their homes.",
    " Title: Kurdish Forces Secure Key Highway in Iraq, Aided by U.S. Special Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nKurdish forces, known as the pesh merga, have successfully secured a significant portion of Highway 47 in Iraq, cutting off one of the main supply routes for the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL). This operation was supported by U.S. Special Forces, who served as advisers to the pesh merga forces, although they remained away from the immediate fighting.\n\nThe pesh merga acquired a small number of armored American Humvees, left behind by the Iraqi Army during their rapid offensive last year. However, they faced challenges with another piece of captured American equipment, a heavily armored personnel carrier, which broke down and had to be towed.\n\nThe pesh merga's progress was marked by celebratory moments, such as blasting Kurdish music and dancing after reaching the base of Mount Sinjar. Despite these victories, the forces continued their march, with a makeshift meal of bread and canned fish before resuming their journey.\n\nAs the pesh merga approached Highway 47, the sound of military jets and the thud of explosions grew closer. These were identified as A-10 attack planes and B-1 heavy bombers, according to the American command.\n\nApproximately two dozen U.S. Special Forces members were deployed, with half of them stationed at the foot of Mount Sinjar as the main headquarters, and the other dozen spread along the long mountain ridge to advise Kurdish airstrike spotters in selecting targets.\n\nGeneral Waisi's Kurdish force, known as the Zeravani Force, spread out to secure a broader area of Highway 47 west of Sinjar. However, other forces working in parallel were engaged in different sections of the highway. By midday, Kurdish officials reported controlling about 22 miles of Highway 47, stretching both east and west of Sinjar, effectively isolating the Islamic State's supply route between Syria and the jihadist-held city of Mosul in Iraq. The exact number of U.S. forces involved in the operation remains unavailable.",
    " Title: Former Republican Lawmakers Urge Congressional Republicans to Oppose President Trump's Emergency Declaration\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of former Republican lawmakers has urged Congressional Republicans to block President Trump's emergency declaration in an open letter released on Monday. The letter, first published by Politico, calls on Congress to support a joint resolution ending the national emergency declared by President Trump earlier this month.\n\nFive former Senators and 19 House members signed the letter, expressing their opposition to the national emergency declaration and the potential expansion of executive authority. The former lawmakers, who served between 1967 and 2013, argue that the national emergency declaration sets a dangerous precedent that could be used against Republicans by a future Democratic administration.\n\nIn the letter, the former lawmakers write, \"We who have signed this letter are no longer Members of Congress but that oath still burns within us.\" They continue, \"That is why we are coming together to urge those of you who are now charged with upholding the authority of the first branch of government to resist efforts to surrender those powers to a president.\"\n\nPresident Trump resorted to a national emergency declaration after Republicans on a specially-designated conference committee failed to secure the $5.7 billion he had long demanded for the construction of a border wall as part of a broader spending package. The former lawmakers, in their letter, embrace a common critique of the national emergency declaration, pointing out that the expansion of executive authority could eventually be wielded against Republicans by a Democratic administration.\n\n\"What will you do when a president of another party uses the precedent you are establishing to impose policies to which you are unalterably opposed?\" they ask. \"There is no way around this difficulty: what powers are ceded to a president whose policies you support may also be used by presidents whose policies you abhor.\"\n\nThe House will vote this week on a resolution to end the national emergency, which has thus far received the support of only one Republican, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan.",
    " Title: Trump's Unconventional Approach to Presidency Challenges Traditional Governance Norms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from traditional governance dynamics, President Donald Trump has emerged as the most dominant figure in American life despite being the most unpopular first-year president in modern history, according to polls. Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, notes, \"You've got someone who is defining the presidency very differently.\"\n\nTrump, according to Beschloss, is operating outside the boundaries that have been expected or followed for 200 years, stating, \"Trump is essentially saying, 'I'm not going to operate just within the boundaries that the founders might have expected or people might have expected for 200 years. I'm going to operate within the boundaries of what is strictly legal, and I'm going to push those boundaries if I can.'\"\n\nWilliam M. Daley, who served as a cabinet secretary under Bill Clinton and as White House chief of staff under Barack Obama, echoes this sentiment, stating, \"Everyone else seemed to play within a certain box. But this one is totally outside the box.\"\n\nPresidents, including Trump, have historically sought to expand the power of their office. Trump, like his predecessor Barack Obama, who made ambitious use of executive power despite opposition in Congress, has turned to his presidential pen to enact sweeping policies. However, Trump has shown a unique resistance to the constraints imposed on the presidency, often lashing out at judges, lawmakers, investigators, and journalists who displease him.\n\nTrump's sense of government is not based on coalition building or a balancing act between equal branches. Instead, he deems what is necessary, and the system should fall in line. In recent days, Trump told The New York Times that he believes he has an \"absolute right\" to order the Justice Department to open or close investigations into himself or his foes. This assertion of power has sparked concerns about authoritarianism, although Trump, for the most part, has demonstrated more bark than bite.\n\nThe question remains whether Trump will follow through on his threats in the next stage of his tenure or whether his attacks will prove ultimately self-defeating. The discussion of \"absolute\" power and Trump's noted affinity for foreign strongmen have fueled fears of authoritarianism. However, the extent to which Trump will exercise this power remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Veteran Reflects on Service During Vietnam Era and Advocacy for Gold Star Families\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant reflection, a veteran shares his experiences during the Vietnam War era, highlighting the impact of his service and his subsequent advocacy for Gold Star families. The veteran, who was drafted in 1971 and served in the Army Medical Corps, was initially ordered to Vietnam but was instead sent to Camp Casey in South Korea.\n\nThe veteran served in the 2nd Infantry Division's Army Medical Corps, a unique unit with a rich history. The 2nd Infantry Division, 2nd Medical Battalion is the only Army infantry division to have been led by Marine Corps Generals, Major General John A. Lejeune and Brigadier General Charles A. Doyen. The 2nd Infantry Division is also known for their World War I victory at the Battle of Belleau Wood, which earned Marines the nickname 'Devil Dogs.'\n\nThe veteran's wartime medical experiences were vastly different from his medical school training. In Korea, he found himself practicing medicine in conditions reminiscent of the American Civil War, with limited tools and resources. Despite the challenges, he worked alongside three other doctors, caring for nearly 10,000 infantrymen.\n\nMemorial Day holds a special significance for the veteran, as he remembers the lives of the two soldiers they saved from extreme heat exhaustion in 1973 and the many fallen comrades. He emphasizes that Memorial Day is a day to honor and remember the sacrifices of those who gave their lives for the country.\n\nIn recent years, the veteran has turned his attention to advocating for Gold Star families, the families of the nation's fallen heroes. He authored the Forever GI Bill, a bill that allows eligible veterans to use their GI Bill benefits at any point in their lifetime and makes Fry Scholarship participants eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program. He also introduced the Fry Scholarship Improvement Act of 2019, a bill that extends eligibility for the Fry Scholarship to surviving spouses and children of deceased National Guard and Reserve members whose deaths are deemed service-connected by VA, but who died while not on active-duty if the death occurred within four years of the servicemember's last discharge.\n\nThis Memorial Day, the veteran encourages everyone to honor the fallen by saying a prayer, visiting a VA cemetery, contacting their member of Congress, or volunteering with a Veterans Service Organization (VSO). He mentions several organizations, such as America's Gold Star Families, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, and the Travis Manion Foundation, that focus on honoring our nation's fallen.\n\nThe veteran concludes by expressing his gratitude for those who have served and sacrificed for the country and his pride in living in a nation built on those sacrifices. He prays for every life lost fighting for our freedom.",
    " Title: U.S. Lawmakers Reach Principle Agreement on Farm Bill, Ending Months of Partisan Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. lawmakers have reached a principle agreement on the Farm Bill, the top agriculture lawmakers and senators announced on Thursday. The agreement caps months of bitter partisan debate over the legislation that funds $867 billion in food and agriculture programs.\n\nIn a joint statement, the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees stated, \"We are pleased to announce that we\u2019ve reached an agreement in principle on the 2018 Farm Bill. We are working to finalize legal and report language as well as CBO scores, but we still have more work to do. We are committed to delivering a new farm bill to America as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe programs covered by the bill include crop subsidies and support to access export markets, areas essential for American farmers, a key constituency of U.S. President Donald Trump. The latest bill, passed in 2014, expired on Sept. 30 after talks over its replacement broke down.\n\nThe agreement is yet to be integrated into the text of the legislation, and lawmakers will have to decide whether it will be voted on as a standalone bill or within a bigger package. Once voted on, the bill goes to the president for final signature. Lawmakers have until the end of the year to finalize the process.\n\nThe debate over the Farm Bill has been marked by contentious issues, such as the imposition of stricter work requirements for recipients of food stamps and the impact of trade wars on American farmers. The latest bill's expiration coincided with the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. on key commercial partners, such as China, the top buyer of U.S. farm produce, which has been absent from the market due to these tariffs.\n\nRecently, the main standoff had focused on forestry provisions following the deadly wildfires in California. The details of the agreement regarding these issues are not yet available.",

However, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declined the offer, stating that Iraqi, Kurdish, and other local forces are capable of handling the battle for Mosul without foreign intervention.\n\nAl-Abadi, through a translator, expressed that Iraqi forces, in coalition with Kurdish peshmerga soldiers, American advisers, and various ethnic minority paramilitary units, can manage the large-scale offensive to recapture Mosul, which was overrun by Islamic State militants in 2014.\n\nThe U.S. acknowledges Iraq's sovereignty but seeks to resolve disputes between coalition partners to combat the common enemy, as stated by Carter. He expressed confidence in planning a constructive role for the U.S. in the region.\n\nCarter's visit follows the death of a U.S. service member, the fourth since the U.S. began military operations in the region in August 2014, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMeanwhile, an apparent counter-attack by suspected Islamic State fighters resulted in the death of 80 people and the wounding of 170 others in the oil city of Kirkuk on Friday. Most of the casualties were Kurdish security forces. The attack occurred as Iraqi forces advanced on militant-held Mosul about 100 miles to the northwest.\n\nIn another development, hundreds were treated for breathing problems due to a burning sulfur plant set ablaze Thursday in Mishraq, south of Mosul. Residents reported coughing, headaches, and nosebleeds from the gray smoke.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office received reports on Friday that hundreds of families were forced out of villages and herded toward Mosul for potential use as human shields by the Islamic State. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over the possibility of the militants using these vulnerable people as human shields or killing them.\n\nThe militants forced about 200 families out of Samali and 350 families out of Najalfia on Monday, according to the human rights office. At least 40 civilians were shot dead in one of the villages outside Mosul, under a report the office is investigating.",
    " Title: White House Pushes for Easing Guantanamo Bay Detainee Transfer Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe debate over the detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay is resurfacing on Capitol Hill as the White House seeks to loosen restrictions on transferring detainees, despite concerns from some lawmakers about the potential risks associated with such actions.\n\nOpponents of swift action on Guantanamo have long warned about the issue of recidivism among former detainees. An official estimate from last year indicated that nearly 28 percent of former detainees were suspected of returning to the battlefield.\n\nAdministration officials are hoping to leverage a Senate defense policy bill to advance their long-standing goal of moving detainees out of the Cuba-based prison camp and, eventually, shutting it down. The bill, set for debate in the coming days, would allow them to transfer prisoners who have been cleared for overseas transfer but are still detained, in part due to a complex Pentagon certification process.\n\nThe bill would ease those restrictions and lift a ban on bringing suspected terrorist prisoners from Guantanamo to the United States for detention, trial, or emergency medical treatment.\n\nThe White House's effort faces strong resistance, with opponents pointing out that some former detainees have re-engaged in terrorist activities after being released from the remote U.S. naval prison in Cuba.\n\n\"Why would you want to lower the standard?\" asked Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), who, along with Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), is working on amendments to preserve the current high bar for transfers.\n\nEven if the Senate passes the White House-backed legislation, the House earlier this year approved a measure that further restricts transfers, including an outright ban on sending detainees to Yemen. Yemen is a particular challenge since more than half of the 164 detainees are from there and is home to the world's most active Al Qaeda branch.\n\nObama himself imposed a ban on Yemeni transfers from Guantanamo after a Nigerian man attempted to blow up a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas 2009 with explosives hidden in his underwear on instructions from Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen. However, Obama lifted that moratorium in his May 23 speech at National Defense University, stating that Guantanamo \"has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.\"\n\n\"I transferred 67 detainees to other countries before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries or imprisoning them here in the United States. These restrictions make no sense,\" Obama said. He has vowed to close the prison.\n\n\"There is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened,\" Obama said.\n\nPurely from an economic point of view, the administration says Guantanamo is too costly. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress that annual spending on Guantanamo was $454 million\u2014or about $2.7 million per detainee.\n\nObama has not publicly discussed Guantanamo in the six months since the speech, but administration officials say he presses Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry on the matter every week. Obama also has new special envoys for Guantanamo closure at the State Department and Pentagon working full time on the matter.\n\n\"Our marching orders are very clear from the president, and in terms of what he wants to do, and that's to close the facility,\" said envoy Clifford Sloan at the State Department.\n\nSloan said achieving that goal requires three steps\u2014transferring out those who have been approved, prosecuting others, and making a plan for the remaining detainees accused of participating in dangerous plots who cannot be prosecuted because the evidence against them is inadmissible in a court of law. That's a tall order on a three-year clock, but Sloan vowed, \"Step by step, we will get there, and we will close it.\"\n\nSloan has been holding meetings across Capitol Hill to push for more flexibility, while Lisa Monaco, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser in the White House, has been calling moderate senators to encourage them to back the Senate bill.\n\nThe Senate bill would allow the Pentagon to transfer any detainee the administration no longer considers a threat to the United States, as long as actions are taken to \"substantially mitigate the risk\" that the detainee would re-engage in terrorism and ensure that the transfer is in the national security interest of the United States.\n\nThis summer, the administration sent home two Algerian detainees. Eighty-four others have long been cleared for transfer, and the U.S. government has begun a formal review process of about 45 others previously considered too dangerous to be released to determine if circumstances have changed.\n\nAyotte argued the Algerian transfers prove the current process is working, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) agreed that the administration does not need more flexibility. \"All they have to do is assure us that they won't re-enter the fight, as numerous ones have, in leadership positions. We can't do that,\" McCain said.\n\nChris Anders, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, which wants to close Guantanamo, acknowledges the issue is always a tough vote for lawmakers but argues there's a growing recognition that Guantanamo can't stay open forever and harms national security.\n\n\"What's different this year compared to past years is that the president is ready and willing to use whatever authority Congress gives him to start closing Guantanamo, and particularly to start sending home the majority of detainees who were long ago cleared to be sent back home,\" Anders said.",
    " Title: Obama's Balanced Approach to Ferguson Draws Mixed Reviews\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's remarks on the Ferguson, Missouri, situation have received mixed reviews, with some criticizing his approach as subdued and others praising his efforts to maintain a balanced stance. In an interview with ABC's Ann Compton, Obama expressed sympathy for the community's outrage over the killing of Michael Brown while also emphasizing the importance of addressing black crime.\n\nPolitico described Obama as \"guarded, reserved, and deeply clinical\" in his comments on Ferguson. Critics argue that the president did not delve deeply into the pain of the racial divide or the underlying tensions, with Fox's Charles Krauthammer stating that Obama's comments were \"instrumental\" rather than \"emotional.\"\n\nHowever, Obama's measured approach may have been a strategic decision, given the volatile nature of the situation in Ferguson, which has seen nightly confrontations with police, numerous arrests, and shootings. Obama's past criticisms, such as his comments on the Trayvon Martin and Henry Louis Gates cases, were criticized for appearing to take sides before all the facts were in.\n\nIn his remarks on Ferguson, Obama made an effort to separate lawful dissent from violence, stating, \"While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos.\" He also emphasized the importance of safeguarding constitutional rights, including the right to free speech, assembly, and a free press.\n\nObama also expressed sympathy for African-Americans, acknowledging the mistrust that exists between local residents and law enforcement in many communities. He stated, \"In too many communities, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.\"\n\nDespite this, Obama also emphasized the need to prosecute lawbreakers, regardless of their race or the root causes of their actions. He stated, \"There are young black men that commit crime. And we can argue about why that happens because of the poverty they were born into or the lack of opportunity or the school systems that failed them or what have you, but if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted because every community has an interest in public safety.\"\n\nOverall, Obama's approach to the Ferguson situation has been characterized by a measured and balanced stance, aimed at avoiding inflaming an already volatile situation while expressing sympathy for the community and emphasizing the importance of upholding the law.",
    " Title: Trump's \"War on Christmas\": A Look at the Controversy Surrounding the Holiday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unique cultural blend, a Hindu-Jewish couple celebrates Christmas, incorporating traditional Christmas elements with their own cultural and religious influences. However, their celebration may face challenges in Donald Trump's America, where the President has vowed to end the perceived \"War on Christmas\" and promote the holiday more prominently.\n\nThroughout his post-election victory tour, Trump has reiterated his commitment to promoting Christmas and ending the use of \"Happy Holidays\" in favor of \"Merry Christmas.\" This stance has been met with criticism, as some argue that efforts to exclude other holidays infringes on the separation of church and state.\n\nTrump has publicly criticized businesses perceived as not showing enough Christmas spirit, such as Starbucks, which redesigned its cups to emphasize a generic holiday theme rather than a Christmas one. He has also threatened to evict Starbucks from his hotel and encouraged boycotts of the coffee chain.\n\nIf Trump's actions as President escalate, he could potentially use the power of his office to enforce Christmas observance, leading to concerns about potential IRS audits, OSHA citations, and other forms of persecution.\n\nThe debate over Christmas observance in public spaces has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that efforts to remove nativity scenes from public squares violate the separation of church and state. However, the First Amendment's primary purpose is to prevent majoritarian oppression, not to eradicate religious expression in public spaces.\n\nTrump's pledge to \"Make America Say Merry Christmas Again\" has been criticized for potentially turning Christians from victims to victimizers. This could lead to religious minorities feeling pressured to conform to the majority's customs, potentially leading to increased polarization and passive resistance.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Christmas observance in America may lead to a reevaluation of cultural defaults and potentially force millions of people, like the Hindu-Jewish couple in the article, to question their role in the cultural landscape. This could lead to a politicization of innocent and unconscious observances, generating anti-Christmas subversion rather than sincere celebration.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over Christmas observance in America is a complex issue with deep cultural and political implications. It is crucial for all parties involved to approach the issue with understanding and respect for the diversity of beliefs and practices that make up American society.",
    " Title: Trump's Continued War on the Media as President-elect\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President-elect, Donald Trump's antagonism towards the media persists. At a recent meeting with top television executives, Trump criticized the networks for their \"outrageous\" and \"dishonest\" coverage, and reportedly told CNN chief Jeff Zucker that \"everyone at the network is a liar and you should be ashamed.\" On the same day, instead of holding a press conference, Trump released a YouTube video updating the public on the White House transition, stating that it had proceeded \"very smoothly, efficiently, and effectively.\"\n\nPresidential animosity towards the press is not a new phenomenon. Presidents have historically expressed frustration with a perceived unsympathetic press corps that misinterprets their words for the news, making it difficult to communicate clearly to the American public. To mitigate this, presidents have reduced the number of press conferences they hold while increasing communication through other means. The emergence of social media has allowed Trump to take this trend to the next level.\n\nHowever, Trump's war on the media could undermine the media as an effective forum for debate and deliberation. By avoiding engagement with journalists and stifling media critics through public shaming and other strong-arm tactics, Trump will weaken the press's ability to act as a watchdog and critic, as envisioned by the Founders and embodied in the First Amendment. By attacking the media's objectivity and credibility, the Trump administration will weaken public confidence in the public sphere and, by extension, in the entire project of democratic self-governance.\n\nTrump currently enjoys a significant level of support for his assault on the news media. In a post-election Pew survey, for example, just 22 percent of Americans gave the press either an A or B for its campaign coverage, with 59 percent giving it a D or F. A September 2016 Gallup poll found that just 32 percent of the public trust the press a fair amount or a great deal to report news \"fully, accurately, and fairly,\" the lowest figure since Gallup first asked the question in 1976.\n\nThe timing of Trump's war on the media is not accidental. The media have become an arena of conflict in the increasingly polarized political system. To those who believe that the media exhibits a liberal bias, Trump is a welcome corrective. Consequently, the recent decline in trust has been driven primarily by Republicans, with just 14 percent of whom now believe the mass media deserves even a fair amount of trust compared to 30 percent of independents and 51 percent of Democrats.\n\nA related trend is the increasing Balkanization of news audiences around competing news sources. For example, a 2014 Pew study showed that 47 percent of \"consistent conservatives\" name Fox News as their primary (and trusted) source of news about politics, while almost completely avoiding other major news outlets like The New York Times.\n\nEven more concerning is the fact that the trend appears most pronounced among younger Americans, who tend to be somewhat more liberal than their parents. In 2016, just 26 percent of those under the age of 50 trusted the news media compared to 38 percent of those age 50 or older. Nor does the advent of social media help. Just 34 percent of American adults who use the web trust the information they get from social media sources.\n\nHow Trump will deal with the media and how the media will respond to Trump remains to be seen. The past 30 years or so do not provide much hope for optimism. The news industry has been pummeled by the fragmentation of the news audience and the emergence of the Internet. In the difficult economic environment they face, news organizations have shown little stomach for increasing hard news budgets or supporting much in the way of investigative journalism. Instead, a good deal of what passes for American journalism today is simply information recycled straight from government sources. There are exceptions, of course, as well as newer, non-traditional sources of news and opinion that provide alternative narratives to the mainstream media accounts. Most encouraging, perhaps, are the emerging signs that Trump's election may lead to a reinvigorated sense of duty on the part of journalists, news organizations, and NGOs. Whether these initial responses add up to an effective counterpoint to Trump's bully pulpit, however, remains to be seen.\n\nTrevor Thrall is a senior fellow for the Cato Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans View Political Correctness as a Problem, According to New Survey\n\nArticle:\n\nA survey conducted by More in Common, an international research initiative, has found that political correctness (P.C.) is deeply unpopular among the majority of Americans. The survey, which asked respondents questions about race, immigration, sexism, free speech, and other hot-button issues, categorized participants into seven groups: progressive activists, traditional liberals, passive liberals, the apathetic, moderates, traditional conservatives, and devoted conservatives. The two conservative categories constituted 25 percent of the total, while the progressives made up just 8 percent.\n\nThe remaining participants, according to the researchers, form an \"exhausted majority\" whose views are not significantly different from one another, even across racial and gender lines. Yascha Mounk, writing for The Atlantic, notes that \"most members of the 'exhausted majority,' and then some, dislike political correctness.\" The survey found that 80 percent of the general population believe that \"political correctness is a problem in our country.\" This sentiment is shared across all age groups, with 74 percent of people aged 24 to 29 and 79 percent under age 24 expressing similar views.\n\nMounk observes that \"youth is not a good proxy for support of political correctness\u2014and it turns out race is not either.\" The best proxies for support of political correctness, according to the survey, are education level and income. The most highly educated Americans are more likely to think hate speech is a significant problem, but political correctness is not.\n\nIn previous articles for \u2588\u2588\u2588, the author has discussed the potential backlash against political correctness and its potential role in Donald Trump's presidential victory. Voters who cited political correctness as a top issue were particularly drawn to Trump's candidacy, and being upset about PC-run-amok was a top indicator of whether a person voted Republican in 2016. Many people who wrote to the author about political correctness expressed that they voted for Trump specifically because they feel the language is moving away from them too quickly, and they don't know how to navigate the newly woke culture.\n\nMounk suggests that downplaying the concerns of the anti-PC majority could be a detrimental campaign strategy for any would-be Trump challenger. He argues that the gap between the progressive perception and the reality of public views on this issue could harm the influence and readership of publications and political candidates who misrepresent the views of the majority of Americans. In a democracy, it is difficult to win fellow citizens over to one's own side or to build public support to address real injustices when one fundamentally misunderstands how the public sees the world.",
    " Title: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Criticizes President Obama's Handling of Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a critical opinion piece published by Fox News, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has accused President Barack Obama of being \"incapable of being the commander-in-chief of the United States of America\" in his handling of the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nJindal, who is reportedly considering a presidential run in 2016, criticized Obama's refusal to label the conflict as a war against \"radical Islam.\" He argued that the president's reluctance to acknowledge the problem of \"radical Islamic terrorism\" prevents him from addressing it effectively.\n\nJindal also took issue with recent comments made by Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, who suggested on MSNBC that a lack of job opportunities could be a factor in people joining such groups. Jindal described this as \"madness\" and argued that killing the enemy is the key to winning a war.\n\nFurthermore, Jindal called for Congress to amend President Obama's request for an Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) to remove a prohibition on ground troops. He described the current prohibition as a political strategy designed to appease the left and as a check on the next president.\n\nJindal concluded his piece by calling for President Obama to tell the American people the truth about \"radical Islam\" and to put political considerations aside in order to defeat the terrorists.",
    " Title: White House Refuses to Dig into IRS-White House Communications Regarding Private Taxpayer Information\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has informed Congress that it will not search its computers for emails that could provide insight into the sharing of private taxpayer information with President Obama's top aides. In a letter last week, White House Chief Counsel W. Neil Eggleston stated that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would address the issue once it completes its ongoing document productions, following the resolution of the tea party-targeting scandal.\n\nHowever, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen's letter from last year did not indicate that the IRS would revisit the email search. Instead, Mr. Koskinen stated that the extensive search, which would have involved combing through 90,000 email accounts, was logistically impossible.\n\nThe White House's decision comes despite its past performance of a similar email search, following the loss of thousands of emails from former IRS division chief Lois G. Lerner, a key figure in the tea party targeting scandal. House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan is investigating whether the laws governing taxpayer information security are effective, which falls under his committee's jurisdiction.\n\nThe IRS has been under scrutiny for several years due to scandals such as the targeting of tea party groups and the illegal release of private taxpayer information concerning the National Organization for Marriage. The IRS maintains that the disclosure was accidental and not politically motivated, but it did pay a settlement to the organization.\n\nSome outside pressure groups argue that the IRS's improper behavior extends beyond these incidents, including the disclosure of private taxpayer information to the White House. These groups point to comments by a top White House economic adviser who, in 2010, stated that Koch Industries, the company run by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, paid no corporate income taxes.\n\nThe IRS's inspector general is currently investigating this issue, but has refused to release documents and is facing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit over the matter. Both the House and Senate are now investigating IRS and White House communications.\n\nIn response to Mr. Ryan's request last week, the White House did not assert any privileges, instead insisting that the IRS would work on it. This contradicts Mr. Koskinen's 2014 letter, which made clear that such a search was not feasible from the IRS's end. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment on whether it had rethought its stance in light of the White House's promise, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment on why its chief counsel had misrepresented the IRS's position as stated in Mr. Koskinen's letter.\n\nIn 2014, the IRS admitted to losing some of Ms. Lerner's emails, prompting the Ways and Means Committee to ask the White House if it had any such emails. Mr. Obama's aides complied with that request, even providing three emails that Congress had not asked for.\n\nOfficial requests for private taxpayer information made by the White House are supposed to be personally signed by the president, and the Joint Committee on Taxation is supposed to be notified of the request. The JCT issues an annual report on all requests for IRS information, and these reports do not show any such requests from the president during President Obama's time in office.\n\nMark W. Everson, who was commissioner of the IRS under President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2007, said both sides try to observe a strict division. \"I can't remember this ever having come up\u2014at least it ever having been brought to my attention,\" he said. \"In my experience, the White House and the service were scrupulous about making sure appropriate independence was maintained between the two.\"\n\nMr. Koskinen has told Congress he is working in good faith to restore trust in his agency and to cooperate with lawmakers' investigations, which he says have cost millions of dollars in staff time and additional computer capacity. The tax agency has turned over hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in the tea party investigation, and congressional committees, including Ways and Means, are trying to finalize their reports on the wrongdoing.",
    " Title: Violence Erupts at Guantanamo Bay Prison Following Shift to Individual Cells\n\nArticle:\n\nInmates at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba clashed with guards on Saturday after military authorities decided to end communal housing in one of the prison's camps and instead move prisoners into individual cells. At least one detainee was reportedly injured by a rubber bullet during the incident.\n\nThe violence began after the facility's commander ordered the move on Saturday morning. According to the U.S. Southern Command, the decision was made due to detainees covering windows and surveillance cameras, limiting guards' ability to monitor them continuously.\n\nThe forced transfer was also used as an opportunity to evaluate the health of the prisoners, as dozens of them are currently on a hunger strike. Some detainees resisted with improvised weapons, according to the official statement, and in response, four less-than-lethal rounds were fired. There were no serious injuries to guards or detainees.\n\nThe prisoners' weapons included batons, broomsticks, and plastic water bottles, according to multiple reports. The incident occurred in an area of Guantanamo Bay that had evolved into a \"medium-security\" section since the first inmates were brought there more than 10 years ago.\n\nAccording to The Miami Herald, a recent visit to the camp showed that the guards \"had lost a measure of control\" over the inmates. \"The captives could be seen systematically disobeying communal camp rules. They covered surveillance cameras in individual cells with cereal boxes,\" writes Carol Rosenberg. \"They refused to admit food carts to the cellblocks.\" Commanders said they were concerned that, out of view of the guard force, there were stealth hunger strikers who could suddenly die.\n\nReports of the number of prisoners who are currently on a hunger strike fluctuate, with some news outlets citing the Pentagon's estimate of 43 prisoners out of a total of 166, and others saying the number is more than 60, citing sources in the military and the inmates' defense attorneys.\n\nLast week, the Pentagon named 11 inmates who were being force-fed to prevent them from starving themselves to death. The hunger strike was reportedly prompted by inmates' anger over guards' searching their Qurans and other practices that began after a change in command at the base last summer.",
    " Title: Former GOP Presidential Candidate Jon Huntsman Skips 2012 Republican National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has announced that he will not attend the 2012 Republican National Convention, joining a small group of high-profile Republicans who have chosen to skip the event. However, this group does not constitute a formal coalition, as the reasons for their absence appear to serve different political purposes.\n\nHuntsman, the former Utah governor and ambassador to China, stated on Friday that he would not attend the convention, which takes place in Tampa, Florida, from August 27-30, unless the Republican Party focuses on a more inclusive and problem-solving-oriented future for the United States.\n\nThe decision comes after Huntsman was reportedly dis-invited from a GOP fundraiser following his suggestion in January, after dropping out of the presidential race, that a third party should enter the race. He later compared the GOP to China's communist party for its response.\n\nAnother notable Republican, George Allen, is also among those who have announced they will not attend the convention. Allen's campaign stated on Tuesday that the former Virginia senator and governor is too focused on his close race with Democrat Tim Kaine for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Jim Webb. The race has been too close to call since both candidates announced their candidacies.\n\nAllen's critics have attempted to brand him as a Washington insider, which may also explain his decision to distance himself from the national party.\n\nThree other GOP candidates for Senate \u2013 Heather Wilson in New Mexico, Rep. Denny Rehberg in Montana, and Linda McMahon in Connecticut \u2013 have also stated they will not attend the convention to focus on their respective races.\n\nHuntsman won two delegates for his third-place finish in New Hampshire. He will release these delegates to Mitt Romney, whom he has endorsed. In his announcement, Huntsman reiterated his campaign theme of \"Country First.\"\n\n\"I encourage a return to the party we have been in the past, from Lincoln right on through to Reagan, that was always willing to put our country before politics,\" he said.",
    " Title: Study Warns of Potential Impact of Ocean Acidification on Shark Teeth and Scales\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in Scientific Reports suggests that ocean warming and acidification could pose a significant threat to sharks, potentially disrupting their role as apex predators and altering marine food webs. The research, led by Lutz Auerswald, a fisheries biologist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa and the nation's Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, indicates that increased acidity in ocean water could cause shark teeth and scales to corrode, compromising their ability to swim, hunt, and feed.\n\nThe study's senior author, Auerswald, notes that larger species, such as great white sharks, are already endangered, and this could exacerbate their decline. The idea for the study emerged from a casual conversation between Auerswald and Sarika Singh, an ocean researcher at South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs, over beers. They pondered the potential impact of more acidic ocean water on shark teeth, given that the high acidity of beer and many carbonated beverages causes human teeth to erode.\n\nWhile numerous studies have examined the effects of ocean acidification on species that build shells or other calcium-based structures, such as corals and shellfish, only a few studies have looked at how acidification might impact sharks. A single paper has examined the effect of pH on sharks' skin denticles or scales, but its results were limited due to the relatively low carbon dioxide concentration used, compared to the high levels already present in many parts of the world's oceans.\n\nFor the new study, Auerswald, Singh, and their colleagues focused on puff adder shy sharks, a small, bottom-dwelling South African species of cat shark that is easily handled and not endangered. The team investigated acidification's effects on the animals' comparatively larger scales, as shark teeth and scales are both made of a calcium phosphate material called dentin, and the researchers expected the effects on teeth to be similar to any impact on the scales.\n\nThe researchers captured puff adder shy sharks in a harbor in Cape Town, South Africa, and transported them to a government research aquarium, where the fish acclimated for four months. They divided 13 of the sharks into control and experimental groups. Control animals stayed in an aquarium with a mildly basic pH of 8.1, matching that of the ocean, while the researchers gradually lowered the pH of the experimental animals' water to 7.3, the level that ocean water is predicted to reach by 2300 if carbon dioxide emissions continue. In some areas, including the waters off South Africa and California, the pH can already drop to 7.3 or lower, depending on prevailing currents and winds.\n\nAfter two months, an electron-microscope analysis revealed that the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in the sharks' denticles were significantly reduced. About 25 percent of the experimental group's scales were damaged, compared with only 9 percent in the control group. \"If dissolution is already visible [after just two months], one can only speculate how the sharks would look after a year or more,\" says Fredrik Jutfelt, a biologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, who was not involved in the latest research but co-authored the only other study of shark scales in acidic conditions. \"Increased dissolution of denticles could have serious consequences for sharks for many reasons.\"\n\nThe impacts, however, would likely vary between species. Puff adder shy sharks are sedentary predators that ambush their prey, so corroded scales might not impact their ability to hunt. However, for larger species that swim in open water, such as great white sharks, scales play an important role in hydrodynamics. One study found that shark denticles are responsible for an up to 12 percent increase in swimming speed. Thus, damaged denticles could slow sharks down and make it more difficult for them to catch prey. Scales also protect females from male biting during courtship and help some shark species defend against other predators. Likewise, corrosion to teeth could hit some species harder than others.\n\nOther groups of calcifying organisms, for whom the effects of acidification are more well-studied, show these wide-ranging differences. Auerswald and his colleagues have observed that lobsters are quite resilient in the face of acidification, whereas abalones grow significantly slower, and \"their shells look horrible,\" he says. \"A lot of animals have survived even more acidic conditions in the ancient past, but we also know that a lot of species were wiped out,\" Auerswald says. \"One lesson is that you have to test species by species.\"",
    " Title: Analysis of Stand-Your-Ground Laws and Their Impact on Homicide Rates\n\nArticle:\n\nA study by two Georgia State University economists, Chandler B. McClellan and Erdal Tekin, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, suggests that stand-your-ground laws are associated with a significant increase in homicides among white males. The researchers estimate that between 28 and 33 additional white males are killed each month as a result of these laws.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from at least 24 states that have adopted some variation of a stand-your-ground law since 2005, found a \"significant increase in emergency room visits and hospital discharges related to firearm-inflicted injuries.\" The researchers suggest that increased firearm ownership in states with stand-your-ground laws and the presence of bystanders-turned-victims in public places might account for the increased dangers.\n\nHowever, the impact of stand-your-ground laws on homicide rates varies among states. Florida, which passed its stand-your-ground law in 2005, experienced a spike in murders and manslaughters, but the trend has since returned to the status quo ante. Other states, such as New Mexico, Louisiana, and Delaware, have shown slight increases in their murder rates, while Texas has seen a decline in its rate after the passage of the law. Other states have either shown slight declines or no change at all.\n\nA chart from McClatchy's interactive tool shows the homicide rates of stand-your-ground states, with Washington D.C.'s murder/manslaughter rate in comparison. D.C., which has some of the strictest gun control regulations in the U.S., has a higher murder rate than any of the stand-your-ground states.\n\nThe study's findings challenge the notion that stand-your-ground laws are necessary for public safety. Instead, the researchers suggest that policymakers should focus on addressing the high rate of murders and manslaughters in areas with strict gun control regulations, such as Washington D.C., rather than implementing stand-your-ground laws in states that seem to have a better handle on the situation.",
    " Title: President Trump Praises Puerto Rico Mayor's Change in Tone as Recovery Efforts Continue\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday to assess the ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane Maria, he commented on the change in tone from one of the island's most vocal critics, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz.\n\n\"Well, I think she's come a long way,\" the president said of Cruz, who previously clashed with Mr. Trump over the federal response. Cruz, who has described the federal government's response as \"killing us with inefficiency,\" is scheduled to attend a briefing with Mr. Trump in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.\n\nTrump told reporters as he departed the White House that the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico were comparable to those in Texas and Florida, stating, \"In Texas and in Florida, we get an A+. And I'll tell you what, I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it's actually a much tougher situation.\"\n\nHe added, \"But now the roads are cleared, communications is starting to come back. We need their truck drivers to start driving trucks.\"\n\nHurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, struck Puerto Rico on September 20, causing widespread destruction, knocking out power, communication, and transportation systems. Nearly two weeks after the storm made landfall, power is still out for 95 percent of electricity customers, and much of the countryside lacks access to life-sustaining basics, including food and fresh water.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump responded to Cruz with criticism of his own, writing on Twitter, \"They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\" He also accused the news media, specifically CNN and NBC, of undermining recovery efforts with overly negative reports.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration's efforts took a hit on Tuesday from Oxfam, an international organization that fights poverty and rarely criticizes wealthy nations such as the U.S. during a crisis. Oxfam America President Abby Maxman issued a statement, saying, \"Oxfam has monitored the response in Puerto Rico closely, and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the US government has mounted in Puerto Rico. Clean water, food, fuel, electricity, and health care are in desperately short supply and quickly dwindling, and we're hearing excuses and criticism from the administration instead of a cohesive and compassionate response.\"",
    " Title: Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon Found Dead Amid Criminal Probe and Allegations of Sexual Harassment\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Korea's longtime mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, has been found dead after he was reported missing by his daughter amid a criminal investigation and media reports of alleged sexual harassment. His body was discovered in wooded hills in northern Seoul at around midnight on Friday, more than seven hours after police launched a massive search for him.\n\nPolice reported no signs of foul play and did not provide a cause of death. The apparent suicide came after one of Park's former secretaries filed a complaint on Wednesday, alleging the 64-year-old had sexually harassed her, according to the Yonhap news agency. Police confirmed a criminal complaint had been made against Park but did not elaborate on the nature of the allegations.\n\nIn a note left on his desk and released by the city government with the permission of his family, Park expressed apologies and requested his body to be cremated and his ashes scattered over his parents' grave. A representative for Park's family issued a statement on their behalf, urging people to avoid spreading \"groundless statements.\"\n\nPark was reported missing by his daughter on Thursday at 5:17 pm, according to the police. Yonhap news agency reported that she also told police he had left a message \"like a will.\" Kim Ji-hyeong, a Seoul Metropolitan Government official, said Park did not come to work on Thursday for unspecified reasons and had canceled all of his schedule, including a meeting with a presidential official at his Seoul City Hall office.\n\nPark left the mayor's official residence at approximately 10:40 am on Thursday, wearing a black hat and a backpack, according to the police, and was identified by a security camera at 10:53 am at the entrance to the Mount Bugak hills. Authorities mobilized about 600 police and fire officers, drones, and tracking dogs to locate him. Choi Ik-su, an officer from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, said rescue dogs found Park's body, and that his bag, cellphone, and business cards had been recovered.\n\nPark, a longtime civic activist and human rights lawyer, was elected Seoul mayor in 2011. He became the city's first mayor to be voted to a third term in June 2018 and was instrumental in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. A member of President Moon Jae-in's liberal Democratic Party, he had been considered a potential presidential candidate in 2022 elections.\n\nPark had mostly maintained his activist colors as mayor, criticizing what he described as the country's growing social and economic inequalities and corrupt ties between large businesses and politicians. As a lawyer in the 1990s, he was credited with winning the country's first sexual harassment conviction. He has also been an outspoken critic of Japan's colonial-era policies towards Korea, including the mobilization of Korean and other women as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers.\n\nIn 2018, Park praised women for their courage after a series of women accused powerful politicians and policymakers of sexual wrongdoings amid the #MeToo movement. \"The resolve of individual heroines is not enough. I think we need social solidarity,\" he said at the time.\n\nPark also established himself as a fierce opponent of former conservative President Park Geun-hye and openly supported the millions of people who flooded the city's streets in late 2016 and 2017 calling for her resignation over a corruption scandal.\n\nThere was an outpouring of grief from his supporters, some of whom wailed at Seoul National University Hospital as his body was brought in. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun expressed condolences during a regular meeting on the government's response to COVID-19 response on Friday, saying, \"Mayor Park, who has served Seoul citizens for a decade, was found passed away. I pray that the deceased rest in peace.\"\n\nRuling party chief Lee Hae-chan said Park's death was \"shocking and regretful,\" recalling him as an old friend who fought together for democracy during a dictatorship in the 1980s. Reactions to his death were mixed on social media, including both condolences and criticism that he killed himself to avoid punishment.\n\n\"Mayor Park, you were an excellent politician,\" one poster wrote on Daum, the country's second-largest portal site. \"But a twist of fate put an end to your journey. I hope you are at ease in heaven.\"\n\nOthers were more critical of the mayor, accusing him of exploiting his power to harass a subordinate and then taking his own life to \"avoid the fallout.\" \"The victim must have had painful times in the run-up to the filing of the complaint,\" wrote one user. \"I hope Park reflects on his misdeeds and atones in the afterlife.\"\n\nThe Seoul city government said a memorial altar will be set up in front of the city hall for citizens to pay their respects.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Biological Definition of Sex in Title IX Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly considering a change in the definition of sex in Title IX regulations, which could potentially limit federal recognition of transgender individuals. The proposed definition would define sex as \"a person's status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth.\"\n\nThe Obama administration, in April 2014, expanded the definition of sex in Title IX, a federal civil-rights statute banning sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. The Obama administration's definition included gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. This expansion was done without an act of Congress or a regulatory rulemaking process.\n\nThe Obama administration's interpretation led to aggressive mandates for schools across the nation, requiring the use of a transgender student's chosen pronouns and opening bathrooms, locker rooms, overnight accommodations, and some sports teams to students based on their chosen gender identity, not their biological sex.\n\nThe Trump administration rolled back Obama-era transgender directives, including the sweeping education mandates, but has not formally responded to the previous administration's expansion of the scope of the statute. According to a story in Sunday's New York Times, the administration may issue formal guidance to return the definition of sex in Title IX to its original, biological meaning.\n\nThe proposed change has sparked controversy, with some arguing that it would \"deny the humanity\" of transgender individuals. However, the change would not affect the constitutional rights of any American, nor would it erase the existence of transgender individuals. Every American is still protected by the Bill of Rights and other constitutional rights, and every single American still enjoys the benefit of every other generally applicable statute.\n\nThe claim that the proposed change denies anyone's humanity or existence is a common, inflammatory rhetorical tactic that creates a false choice. The change in regulatory definitions would not deny anyone's humanity or existence, but rather would correct an Obama-administration overreach.\n\nTransgender individuals did not come into existence in April 2014, when the Obama administration altered its interpretation of Title IX. They will not cease to exist if the Trump administration returns to traditional and intended statutory definitions. The rhetoric surrounding this issue is out of control, and members of the Trump administration are simply considering applying conventional rules of statutory construction to correct an Obama-administration overreach.",
    " Title: Democrats Consider Expanding Supreme Court Amidst Controversy Over Court Packing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Merrick Garland situation, discussions regarding the legitimacy and potential expansion of the Supreme Court have arisen. Eric Holder, former Attorney General, has suggested that expanding the number of justices could be a viable option if a Democratic President and Congress are willing to pursue such a change.\n\nThe strategy employed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who blocked President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, is not without precedent, according to Guy's observations. Two Democratic presidential hopefuls, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, have expressed support for this plan.\n\nIn response, Republican legislators are preparing to present amendments to maintain the current number of Supreme Court justices. Rep. Mark Green (R-TN) announced on Tuesday that he will introduce a constitutional amendment to limit the number of justices to 9, the number that has remained consistent since 1869.\n\nRep. Green stated, \"The Supreme Court must remain a fair and impartial branch of government not beholden to party. Schemes to pack the court are dangerous to the Founders' vision of an independent judiciary that serves as a check on both the Executive and Legislative branches of government.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has also taken a stand against court packing, citing the potential destabilization of essential institutions as a concern. In a Fox News op-ed, he expressed his intention to lead the charge in the Senate, stating, \"Court packing is quickly becoming a litmus test for 2020 Democratic candidates as this ugly, winner-take-all rhetoric gains prominence in progressive circles.\"\n\nRubio further explained, \"To prevent the delegitimizing of the Supreme Court, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to keep the number of seats at nine. There is nothing magical about the number nine. It is not inherently right just because the number of seats on the Supreme Court remains unchanged since 1869. But there is something inherently good and important about preventing the further destabilization of essential institutions.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent decisions have raised concerns among progressives. On Tuesday, the justices overturned a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, granting the Department of Homeland Security legal authority to detain illegal immigrants after they have been through a court hearing.",
    " Title: Clinton Launches National Voter Registration Program for Dreamers\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton has announced a new voter registration drive, titled \"Mi Sue\u00f1o, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,\" aimed at registering sympathetic voters, including undocumented individuals known as Dreamers. The Dreamers themselves are prohibited from voting. The program was launched on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children from deportation.\n\nThe Clinton campaign hopes to use the Dreamers, a powerful political organizing force, to encourage Latino and other households to vote for the Democratic nominee. The program is part of an aggressive effort by Clinton's campaign to woo the record 27.3 million Latinos eligible to vote in 2016.\n\nThe program will focus on battleground states such as Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida, where Latinos and other immigrants make up an important part of the voting base. Organizers will remind voters that a Trump presidency could end the Dreamer program, which is already at risk after a June Supreme Court decision that effectively killed Obama's efforts to give legal status to some of the 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nTrump has promised to revoke Obama's executive orders within the first 100 days of his presidency, calling them the \"most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president.\" Clinton has made revamping the country's immigration system a key plank of her presidential campaign and has vowed to restore and expand Obama's programs, close private sector detention centers, and \"take a very hard look at the deportation policies\" currently in force.\n\nLast month, Clinton called on Latino voters to help stop what she called GOP rival Donald Trump's efforts to \"fan the flames of racial division.\" The Clinton campaign stated in a full campaign statement on the latest program, per The Washington Examiner, that \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" aims to organize Dreamers to mobilize their communities and ask voters to consider what is at stake for their families in November. The program will also serve to remind voters of Trump's pledge to eliminate DACA and deport millions of Dreamers and immigrant families.",
    " Title: Microsoft Discloses Cyber Attacks by Iran-Linked Group on US Presidential Campaign, Government Officials, and Journalists\n\nArticle:\n\nMicrosoft, a leading software company, has announced that a hacking group, allegedly linked to the Iranian government, has carried out a cyber attack against a US presidential campaign, current and former American government officials, journalists covering global politics, and prominent Iranians living outside the country.\n\nIn a 30-day period between August and September, the group, known as \"Phosphorus\" or APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team, made over 2,700 attempts to identify Microsoft consumers' email accounts and attacked 241 of these accounts, according to the company's blog post.\n\nFour accounts were compromised as a result of these attempts, but they were not associated with the US presidential campaign or current and former US government officials, Microsoft stated. The company has notified the affected customers and worked to secure their accounts.\n\nHacking to interfere in elections has become a significant concern for governments, particularly after US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran an operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016, allegedly to help Donald Trump become president.\n\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and, in March, received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to carry out attacks. The company stated that the attacks it is disclosing today were not technically sophisticated but attempted to use a significant amount of personal information to identify the accounts of intended targets and in some cases to attempt attacks.\n\nMicrosoft's Digital Crimes Unit has taken legal and technical steps to combat Phosphorus attacks. To help secure consumer accounts, Microsoft recommends that all customers enable two-step verification and periodically check their login history.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Congressional Agreement on Russia Sanctions Bill Limits President Trump's Ability to Lift Sanctions\n\nArticle:\n\nLeaders of both parties in the United States Congress have reached an agreement on legislation that imposes fresh sanctions on Russia for alleged election meddling. The new legislation significantly restricts President Donald Trump's ability to lift any existing sanctions against Russia.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has expressed a desire for diplomatic flexibility with the Kremlin. However, his tenure has been marked by claims that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. election. Moscow denies any wrongdoing, but several U.S. investigations are examining whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials.\n\nThe bipartisan agreement in Congress indicates a firm stance against Russia, regardless of Trump's view. If Trump were to veto the bill, he would risk fueling suspicion that he is overly supportive of the Kremlin, according to correspondents. Conversely, if he signs the bill, he would be implementing legislation that his administration is reportedly opposed to.\n\nSenator Ben Cardin, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the agreement was the result of \"intense negotiations.\" Cardin added, \"A nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies, and we need President Trump to help us deliver that message.\"\n\nChuck Schumer, Senate Democratic leader, said the House of Representatives and the Senate would act on the legislation \"promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis.\" He described a strong sanctions bill as \"essential.\"\n\nThe bill also addresses potential future sanctions against Iran and North Korea. It has already passed the Senate, and the House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on it on Tuesday.\n\nThe legislation allows for new sanctions against Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea, as well as for its alleged meddling in the U.S. election. The U.S. already has sanctions in place against Russian individuals and companies over Crimea. In December, following claims of election hacking, then-President Barack Obama also expelled 35 diplomats and closed two Russian compounds in the U.S.\n\nThe Kremlin has demanded the return of the seized compounds and has threatened \"specific measures\" in retaliation. After high-level talks last week, one Russian official involved said the row had \"almost\" been resolved. However, the new U.S. bill would make it difficult for President Trump to alter sanctions or return diplomatic properties without the approval of Congress.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump hinted he would consider recognizing Crimea as part of Russia and suggested lifting sanctions. In another development, Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergei Kislyak, has returned home after completing his nine-year tenure. Kislyak has been linked to several of President Trump's associates and has been named by U.S. media as a key figure in the investigation into alleged election interference. Kislyak's successor has not yet been named.\n\nU.S. authorities continue to investigate possible collusion between the Trump team and Russia, claims Trump has repeatedly denied. In a new twist on Saturday, reports emerged that Trump was considering presidential pardons for family members, aides, and even himself. Presidents have the power to pardon people before guilt is established or even before the person is charged with a crime. Trump tweeted, \"While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS.\"\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, described the reports as disturbing, adding, \"Pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental line.\"",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Alleges Trump's Involvement in Hush Payments and Russia Dealings\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Cohen, the former personal attorney to President Donald Trump, has claimed that Trump directed him to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, and that he knew these actions were wrong. In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Cohen stated that Trump was aware of the payments' potential impact on the 2016 election.\n\nCohen, who was once known for his unwavering loyalty to Trump, asserted that all decisions made at the Trump Organization were run through the president, and that he was instructed to make the payments and become involved in these matters. He also expressed his belief that people should not trust Trump's statements, stating, \"The man doesn't tell the truth.\"\n\nCohen's assertions come after he pleaded guilty to tax fraud and campaign-finance violations in August, and admitted to lying to Congress about the nature and timing of Trump's business dealings with Russia in November. These admissions have raised concerns about Trump's potential impeachment and indictment.\n\nTrump has responded to Cohen's allegations by accusing him of lying to \"embarrass the president\" and secure a reduced prison sentence. However, Cohen told Stephanopoulos that he had no intention of humiliating Trump and that special counsel Robert Mueller has a \"substantial amount of information\" to corroborate his assertions about the hush agreements and Russia dealings.\n\nIn response to the mounting evidence, Trump's legal team has adjusted its defense. Initially, Trump claimed he had \"NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA,\" but this week, he characterized his dealings with Russia as \"peanut stuff\" that was \"very legal & very cool.\" After denying the president's knowledge of the hush payments, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Daily Beast that \"Nobody got killed, nobody got robbed...This was not a big crime.\"",
    " Title: Vice President Mike Pence Visits Mayo Clinic Without Mask, Despite Mask Requirement\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence visited the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on Tuesday without wearing a mask, despite the facility's requirement for all patients, visitors, and staff to wear face coverings or masks to slow the spread of Covid-19. The Mayo Clinic had informed Pence of its mask policy before the tour.\n\nPence, who leads President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, later stated that he did not need to wear a mask because he is tested regularly for the virus and does not have it. The Mayo Clinic, which is renowned for its medical expertise, requires masks to ensure the safety of its patients and staff.\n\nIn a pool image, Pence is surrounded by 9 other people, including a patient, all wearing masks during the tour. Pence was the only official who did not wear a mask during the discussion with top doctors, according to a pool report. Federal Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn reportedly wore a mask during the tour.\n\nPence participated in a discussion with top doctors, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn, a Republican whose district includes the city of Rochester. The vice president was asked about his decision not to wear a mask during the first question at a news conference at the facility after the tour and discussion.\n\nPence responded that he is tested for the coronavirus regularly, and everyone around him is also tested. He also stated that wearing a mask does not necessarily protect the wearer from the coronavirus but might prevent the inadvertent conveyance of the virus to a loved one, family member, or friend.\n\nWhen asked about the signal wearing a mask might send to the American public, Pence did not directly answer the question. However, he reiterated that he is tested \"on a regular basis.\"\n\nA Mayo Clinic spokesman, when asked for comment, said in an email that the clinic shared the masking policy with the vice president's office. The spokesman did not respond to the question about why the facility deleted its tweet about Pence. The Mayo Clinic later posted a new tweet expressing gratitude for Pence's visit.\n\nPence's aides last week told The New York Times that he did not wear a mask for the same reasons he gave Tuesday. However, the newspaper noted that Pence could contract the virus between his tests, and that the tests are not always accurate.",
    " Title: House to Vote on Immigration Bill: Focus on E-Verify for Controlling Illegal Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives is set to vote on an immigration bill this week, with the aim of addressing the issue of illegal immigration. The bill, sponsored by the House leadership, seeks to find a middle ground between immigration hawks and moderate Republicans.\n\nThe bill includes several commendable provisions, such as granting amnesty for individuals who arrived in the U.S. illegally as minors and have maintained law-abiding behavior, reorienting legal immigration towards the recruitment of skilled workers, reducing legal immigration, and allowing children to be held with their parents while their asylum claims are processed.\n\nHowever, the bill does not mandate the use of E-Verify for new hires, a measure that conservatives are urging to be included. E-Verify is an electronic system that allows employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration has been hesitant to prioritize E-Verify, but it is seen as a crucial tool for controlling illegal immigration. Roughly two-fifths of illegal immigrants did not cross the border illegally; they entered the country legally and overstayed their visas. By making it mandatory for employers to verify the legal status of their new hires, it would be more difficult for illegal immigrants to secure employment, reducing the economic incentive that drives most illegal immigration.\n\nThe bill's current version does not mandate E-Verify, but conservatives are urging for its inclusion. E-Verify would serve as a deterrent against future illegal immigration, making it harder for existing illegal immigrants to switch jobs, and potentially leading some to leave the country. Additionally, the mandatory implementation of E-Verify would make it easier to prosecute employers who exploit illegal workers and depress wages for lower-income Americans.\n\nOnce the flow of illegal immigration is controlled in a sustainable manner, consideration can be given to granting amnesty to those illegal immigrants who have established roots and avoided trouble. The goal is to end the cycle of amnesty inviting more illegal immigration.\n\nThe outcome of the House vote is uncertain, as the bill is not expected to survive a filibuster in the Senate. The vote's main purpose is to establish legislators' positions on immigration policy and to influence the ultimate political resolution of the issue.",
    " Title: President Trump Condemns Racism and White Supremacy, Calls for Cultural Change Following Mass Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of two mass shootings over the weekend, President Donald Trump delivered remarks on Monday, August 5, 2019, condemning the incidents and expressing his condolences. The shootings occurred at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, and in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nTrump described the perpetrators as \"wicked\" and \"twisted monsters.\" He stated that the nation must \"condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy\" and that these \"sinister ideologies must be defeated.\" The president emphasized that hate has no place in America.\n\nWhile not proposing major gun control legislation, Trump suggested strengthening mental health laws and called for the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty. He also proposed \"strong background checks,\" possibly tied to immigration reform.\n\nThe president called for a \"cultural change\" and urged the nation to stop the \"glorification of violence in our society,\" including the \"gruesome and grizzly video games\" that contribute to the \"glorification of violence.\"\n\nTrump's remarks were delivered before pool reporters and cameras from the Diplomatic Room of the White House, not the Oval Office. Vice President Mike Pence stood at his side. The president did not repeat his earlier suggestion about gun background checks in his formal remarks.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama weighed in with a tweet that, while not mentioning Trump by name, reflected scathing criticism of divisive rhetoric. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has demanded that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell call the Senate back from its August recess to consider the bipartisan, House-passed universal background checks bill.\n\nIt was unclear how either of the shootings were related to immigration reform, as Trump suggested. The National Rifle Association applauded Trump's call to address the root causes of violence. Trump's acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney rejected claims that the president's harsh rhetoric on immigration played any role in the shootings.",
    " Title: The Economist Takes a Moderate Approach on Climate Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article, The Economist has adopted a more moderate stance on climate change, challenging the long-held belief that the Earth is highly sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide levels. The publication points out that, over the past 15 years, air temperatures at the Earth's surface have remained relatively stable despite a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the world added approximately 100 billion tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere, accounting for a quarter of all CO\u2082 emissions since 1750. Notably, as James Hansen, the head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, observes, \"the five-year mean global temperature has been flat for a decade.\"\n\nEd Hawkins, of the University of Reading in Britain, notes that surface temperatures since 2005 are already at the low end of the range of projections derived from 20 climate models. If temperatures remain flat, they will fall outside the models' range within a few years.\n\nThe article suggests that if temperatures are likely to rise by only 2\u00b0C in response to a doubling of carbon emissions, and if the likelihood of a 6\u00b0C increase is trivial, the focus might shift from mitigation to adaptation. The author compares this to buying earthquake insurance if one does not live in an earthquake zone, implying that it may be more practical to adapt to the greenhouse-gas emissions rather than attempting to stop them.\n\nThe article does not deny the existence of climate change or the need to address environmental issues. However, it questions the notion that humanity's economic growth is directly causing an imminent, irreversible catastrophe that requires immediate action to cut back on growth. The author suggests that a more honest, less emotional approach to the science, the range of possibilities, and the unknown factors, as well as a more inclusive approach to dissenting opinions, may be more effective in recruiting people to the cause in the long run.",

The incident occurred on Sunday night as protesters were walking towards the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson (D) to demand her resignation.\n\nAccording to a local CBS affiliate KMOV, the protesters were on their way to Krewson's home in Portland Place, a gated community, when they passed by the McCloskey residence. The group, reportedly numbering several hundred, had been calling for Krewson's resignation after she recently read activists' personal information on a livestream.\n\nMark McCloskey told KMOV that they felt threatened, stating, \"It was like the storming of the Bastille, the gate came down, and a large crowd of angry, aggressive people poured through. I was terrified that we\u2019d be murdered within seconds. Our house would be burned down, our pets would be killed.\" He also shared a picture of a gate to the community that he claimed had been broken, but it has not been confirmed whether the gate was damaged by the protesters.\n\nRasheen Aldridge, who was reportedly one of the leaders of the protest, disputed the couple's claims, stating the protest remained peaceful in nature despite the McCloskeys drawing guns on the demonstrators.\n\nIn a statement to KMOV, an attorney representing the McCloskeys, Albert Watkins, defended their actions and said they were not \"race related.\" He added, \"In fact, the agitators responsible for the trepidation were white.\"\n\nWatkins continued, \"The Black Lives Matters movement is here to stay, it is the right message, and it is about time. The McCloskeys want to make sure no one thinks less of BLM, its message, and the means it is employing to get its message out because of the actions of a few white individuals who tarnished a peaceful protest.\"\n\nHe reportedly added that the McCloskeys are lawyers whose professional careers have been marked by their long-standing commitment to protecting the civil rights of clients victimized at the hands of law enforcement. This commitment, he said, continues today in the Isaiah Forman case.",

The legislation, which passed 234-193 along party lines, aims to make voting easier, strengthen ethics rules, and reject a motion to condemn voting by undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe 700-page bill proposes designating Election Day as a federal holiday, requiring all states to offer automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights to convicted felons, instituting independent redistricting commissions to combat gerrymandering, and requiring nonprofit organizations to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than $10,000 to rein in dark-money groups.\n\nU.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation, stated, \"It\u2019s a power grab for the American people.\" In contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said, \"This bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nThe legislation faces little chance of passing in the Senate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicating he will not bring the bill for a vote, effectively killing the bill. Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis (R), the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee on elections, stated before the vote, \"This bill is nothing but a bill that is for loading billions of billions of dollars into the coffers of members of Congress.\"\n\nIn a related debate over voter accessibility, House Democrats also voted Friday to defend localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. The vote would have had minimal effect as non-citizens are barred from participating in federal elections. The GOP-backed measure would have added language to \"H.R.1 stating that \"allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.\"\n\nRep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights movement hero, supported the measure, referencing San Francisco's policy of allowing noncitizens, including undocumented immigrants, to vote in school board elections. Just six Democrats voted against the measure, and one Republican opposed it.",
    " Title: White House Cancels Philadelphia Eagles' Visit Amid Controversy Over National Anthem Protest Misrepresentation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump announced on Monday that he had canceled a planned visit by the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles to the White House, citing the team's alleged disrespect for the national anthem. However, the explanation provided by the President does not align with the facts, as no Eagles players ever stayed in the locker room during the national anthem, nor did any players kneel during the regular season or the playoffs.\n\nThe controversy escalated when Fox News aired footage of Eagles players praying before the national anthem, claiming they were protesting. In response, Zach Ertz, a tight end for the Eagles, tweeted that Fox News should be \"better than this.\" Ertz is among the players featured in the Fox News segment, and he and his teammates released a Bible study phone app on humility and surrender this past fall.\n\nFox News later apologized, acknowledging in a statement to USA Today that no Eagles players ever kneeled in protest during the 2017 season. The White House, in a subsequent statement, alleged that the Philadelphia Eagles \"decided to abandon their fans\" by not attending the White House celebration.\n\nThe controversy over the Eagles' White House visit appears to have backfired on President Trump, including among conservative commentators and GOP members of Congress. Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Ryan Costello tweeted that Trump handled the situation \"poorly,\" while conservative magazine columnist Jonah Goldberg called Trump's statements \"deceitful propaganda.\" RedState contributor Jim Jamitis pointed out the bad optics of excitedly planning a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while denigrating NFL players.\n\nIn an email, a White House spokesperson asked that an updated statement be included in this article. In the statement, the White House alleges that the Philadelphia Eagles \"decided to abandon their fans\" by not attending the White House celebration.",
    " Title: Diligent Opposition vs. Hysteria: The Democrats' Struggle to Adjust to Unified Republican Government\n\n Article:\n\n The election of Donald Trump has marked a significant shift in the political landscape of the United States, bringing unified Republican government to Washington. However, the Democrats seem to be struggling to adapt to this change, as they have been in power for a decade and their strategy to oppose Trump appears to be ineffective.\n\n Since 2005, the Democrats have been in control, winning the Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008. Despite losing the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, they still held the White House, a president seemingly immune from criticism, the courts, the bureaucracy, and large portions of the media.\n\n However, the election of Trump has overturned this understanding, as the Democrats seem not to understand how to deal with Trump and the massive change he is about to bring to the nation's capital. During the general election, they fell for the idea that Trump could be defeated by conventional means, spending hundreds of millions of dollars in negative television advertising and relying on political consultants.\n\n The Democrats currently control neither the House nor the Senate, yet they act as if they do. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's speech to the 115th House of Representatives was a long-winded recitation of the same liberal agenda that has brought her party to its current low. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's pledge to oppose Trump's nominee weeks before inauguration day is a prime example of this misplaced confidence.\n\n Schumer's strategy of opposing Trump's Supreme Court nominee and prolonging the confirmation process for cabinet officials may force the Senate to change the rules so that Supreme Court vacancies can be approved by a majority vote. This could leave the Democrats vulnerable should another vacancy arise in the next two years.\n\n The Democrats' blanket opposition to President-elect Trump extends to his appointments at large. Their willingness to stand on a podium beside a sign that reads, \"Make America Sick Again,\" for example, has been criticized for associating not Trump but themselves with illness.\n\n It remains to be seen how the Democrats will adjust to their new role as the opposition party. However, their hysterics and obnoxious behavior towards Trump may not be the most effective strategy for opposing his policies and appointments.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Had Advance Warning of Iranian Ballistic Missile Attack, Officials Say\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. military officials reported that they had advance warning of an Iranian ballistic missile attack on two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces on Tuesday night. The attack, which involved more than a dozen short-range ballistic missiles, was intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment, and kill personnel, according to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nDuring a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, Milley stated, \"I believe based on what I saw and what I know is that they were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel.\" He added that U.S. military officials were warned about Iran's pending ballistic missile strike \"when the air defense systems went active.\"\n\nMilley explained that \"a little bit of early warning\" and \"normal defensive procedures\" at Al-Assad Air Base prevented American troops from being killed in the missile strike. The attack resulted in the malfunctioning of four missiles, which failed to hit their targets.\n\nAccording to Esper, the 16 short-range ballistic missiles (originally estimated to be 15) were fired from three locations inside Iran during the attack early Wednesday local time. The missiles were intended as a response to the death of Iranian Quds Force Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S.-led drone strike at Baghdad International Airport last week.\n\nEsper stated that between 1,000- to 2,000-pound warheads were sitting on top of the Iranian missiles fired into Iraq. The damage at the bases was largely contained to \"tentage, taxiways, the parking lot, damaged helicopter, things like that, nothing I would describe as major,\" Esper said.\n\nPentagon officials met with President Trump twice in the past 24 hours following the attack, Esper said. Trump announced earlier Wednesday in a nine-minute address to the nation that he would be imposing even more sanctions on Iran in response to the attack.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill have criticized Trump's initial decision to take out Soleimani without first consulting Congress or allies in the region, which has led to escalating tensions in the Middle East. They have since demanded answers from the administration about the alleged imminent threat that sparked the Soleimani attack, and how Trump will de-escalate the tensions with Iran and keep Americans safe.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans for the House to vote Thursday on a War Powers Resolution that aims to limit Trump's military action toward Iran. Pelosi stated, \"Democrats have'serious, urgent concerns about the administration\u2019s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward.'\"\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns coming out of Wednesday's Iran briefing about the administration bypassing Congress's approval for military escalations. Esper responded, \"Most members of Congress do not have access to the intelligence that I think is the most compelling. That\u2019s simply the nature of the intelligence, and it\u2019s restricted to the Gang of 8.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Urges Diplomatic Resolution in Ongoing Diplomatic Row Between Saudi Arabia and Canada\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has called for a diplomatic resolution between Saudi Arabia and Canada in a developing diplomatic row over human rights concerns. The dispute, which has been ongoing for a second day, stems from Canada's demand for the release of women's rights activists and others arrested in Saudi Arabia.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert stated that U.S. officials have raised human rights concerns with the Saudis in the past, but emphasized that Riyadh and Ottawa \"need to diplomatically resolve this together.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia, in response to Canada's demand, expelled the Canadian ambassador from Riyadh and froze all new trade deals between the two countries on Sunday. This action followed a tweet by Canada's leading foreign affairs agency, Global Affairs Canada, expressing concern over the detention of Samar Badawi, the sister of a blogger jailed by Saudi authorities.\n\nCritics argue that Riyadh is attempting to assert its international influence and has overreacted to Canada's comment. The value of Saudi-Canadian trade is primarily composed of Saudi exports of petrochemicals, plastics, and other products, with significant exports to Canada from the Canadian unit of U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp.\n\nMs. Nauert stated that the U.S. is aware of human rights concerns regarding Saudi Arabia but avoided taking a firm position on the Canada-Saudi spat. She noted that the U.S. has a regular dialogue with the Saudi government on human rights and other issues. Ms. Nauert also encouraged the Saudi government to address due process and publicize information on legal cases.\n\nRegarding the specific case between Canada and Saudi Arabia, Ms. Nauert stated that the U.S. has raised the issue with the Saudi government. She asserted that the U.S. respects international recognized freedoms and individual liberty, a stance that has not changed. Ms. Nauert concluded by encouraging both governments to work out their issues together.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Urge Congress to Delay Looming Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey conducted by Selzer & Co. and released by Bloomberg News on Thursday indicates that a majority of Americans want Congress to delay the impending forced spending cuts, which are set to take effect next week. The poll shows that 54% of respondents support delaying the cuts, while 40% favor allowing the cuts to proceed.\n\nThe across-the-board cuts, totaling $85 billion over the next seven months and $1.2 trillion over the next decade, would significantly reduce federal agency spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could decrease economic growth by at least 0.6 percentage points and result in a loss of 750,000 jobs.\n\nThe potential effects of the cuts on everyday Americans include reduced unemployment benefits, longer security lines at airports, furloughs at federal agencies, delays or closures at national parks, and higher prices for chicken and other products due to cuts to food safety programs.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and lawmakers on Capitol Hill now face a March 1 deadline to reach a deal to prevent the cuts, which were initially scheduled to take place at the beginning of the year but were postponed for two months due to a scaled-back fiscal cliff bill.\n\nShould Washington find a deficit-reduction agreement to replace the automatic cuts, known as the sequester, 59% of Americans support White House proposals that call for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, according to the new poll.\n\nIn addition, the poll indicates that a majority of Americans (56%) also support overhauling Social Security and Medicare to reduce the deficit, a position shared by Congressional Republicans.\n\nThe poll's findings align with a Pew Research and USA Today poll released earlier on Thursday, in which 49% of respondents supported delaying the cuts, while 40% favored their implementation. However, a majority of Americans in both polls expressed a desire to address the federal deficit this year.\n\nThe Bloomberg News survey was conducted by Selzer & Co. from February 15-18 with 1,003 U.S. adults via telephone. The poll's sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Democrats to Avoid Violence at Political Rallies, Criticizes Trump's Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech on Friday night, President Barack Obama called on Democrats to refrain from resorting to violence at political rallies, citing an incident at a rally in San Jose this week where anti-Donald Trump demonstrators reportedly assaulted supporters.\n\n\"We saw in San Jose these protesters starting to pelt things at Trump supporters,\" Mr. Obama said at a fundraiser near Biscayne Bay, Florida. \"That's not what our democracy is about. That's not what you do. There's no room for violence. There's no place for shouting. There's no room for a politics that fails to at least listen to the other side\u2014even if you vehemently disagree.\"\n\nThe president emphasized the need for Democrats to \"remind ourselves of who we are and what is best about American democracy, and not slip into some of the bad habits that currently manifest themselves in the other party.\"\n\nMr. Obama also criticized Mr. Trump and his party for using divisive tactics, stating, \"Being able to say that it's immigrants or it's gays or it's somebody that is taking something away from you\u2014that's the essence of the message that the Republican nominee is delivering.\"\n\nThe fundraiser was hosted at the home of personal injury lawyer Robert Rubenstein, with ticket prices ranging from $10,000 to $30,000.\n\nIn addition to addressing the issue of political violence, Mr. Obama also spoke about the media's role in the election, stating, \"Celebrity and fame is such a driver in this culture\u2014and everything's so contested.\"\n\nThe president also gave a plug for Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was in attendance. She is currently facing a primary challenge in her congressional district from Timothy Canova, who is running on a platform of Wall Street reform and has the backing of presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\"She's had my back, I want to make sure we have her back,\" Mr. Obama said.",
    " Title: National Day of Mourning Declared for Former President George H.W. Bush; Funeral Arrangements Detailed\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has declared Wednesday a national day of mourning for former President George H.W. Bush, who passed away on Friday at the age of 94. The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market will be closed on Wednesday, and both markets will observe a moment of silence on Monday.\n\nThe former president's body will be flown to Washington on Monday. A short service will take place at the U.S. Capitol, followed by the former president lying in state in the rotunda from 7:30 p.m. Monday to 8:45 a.m. Wednesday. A state funeral will be held Wednesday at 11 a.m. at Washington National Cathedral, after which the former president's body will be flown to Houston.\n\nThe former president's body will lie in repose at St. Martin's Episcopal Church from 6:45 p.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday. Following a private funeral service at the church, his body will be interred at the George Bush Presidential Library & Museum at Texas A&M University.\n\nTributes to Mr. Bush poured in from political dignitaries in the U.S. and around the world. Mr. Bush served as U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, during the end of the Cold War and the first Persian Gulf War.\n\nHis death was announced late Friday by his son, George W. Bush, who followed in his footsteps to become America's 43rd president in 2001. President Trump said Mr. Bush inspired generations of Americans to public service.\n\nMr. Bush's funeral could affect plans for a spending bill. Congressional leaders have been discussing the possibility of a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown when seven spending bills expire next weekend. While leaders haven't yet made a decision, a short-term spending patch appears more likely in the face of Mr. Bush's funeral proceedings.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D, NY) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D, CA) are expected to meet with President Trump at the White House, where spending negotiations are likely to come up.\n\nPresident Trump, at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, canceled a news conference scheduled for Saturday, citing Mr. Bush's death.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said, \"While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude.\" Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, cited Mr. Bush's willingness to cross party lines to benefit the country and world.\n\nTributes from world leaders, including former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, and the emir of Kuwait, highlighted Mr. Bush's contributions to ending the Cold War, reunifying Germany, and aiding Kuwait after an invasion by Iraq in 1990.",
    " Title: Egypt Designates Muslim Brotherhood as Terrorist Organization, Escalating Crackdown\n\nArticle:\n\nA public bus was bombed in Cairo on Wednesday, marking a shift in the ongoing series of attacks targeting civilians and security forces in Egypt. This incident followed a police compound bombing in the Nile Delta two days prior. The Egyptian government, backed by the military, has declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, potentially deepening the powerhouse political group's underground status.\n\nThe bus bombing in the Cairo district of Nasr City involved a homemade bomb that exploded as a public bus passed by, shattering the windows. At least one more bomb was found nearby, intended to be defused as security forces arrived at the scene, according to Egyptian state TV. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Tuesday's attack on a police compound in Mansoura was claimed by Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, a militant group based in the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nTuesday's attack was the deadliest since July, with 16 fatalities, according to the Associated Press. The group claimed responsibility for the attack, stating it was in retaliation for the security forces' crackdown on Islamists following the July military takeover. Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has also been linked to Al Qaeda and has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in urban areas, including the attempted assassination of the interior minister in October.\n\nThe Egyptian government contends that the Muslim Brotherhood is a national security threat, working with militant groups to orchestrate the campaign of violence, though it has provided no evidence. The Muslim Brotherhood was a popular political force in Egypt, polling ahead of other parties in the country's first free parliamentary elections held in 2012. Since July, the group's top leaders, including former President Mohamed Morsi, have been imprisoned or driven underground. The organization was outlawed in September.\n\nThousands of members and supporters have been imprisoned, and hundreds have been killed, according to The New York Times. Wednesday's terrorist designation is a significant blow to the 80-year-old Islamist organization. Analysts view it as the most severe crackdown on the movement in decades, potentially outlawing hundreds of social and charity organizations run by Brotherhood members and making it a crime to promote the Brotherhood \"by words.\"\n\nKhalil al-Anani, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington who studies the Brotherhood, warned that the government's move could lead Egypt toward \"civil conflict.\" \"This is a big miscalculation from the government,\" he told The New York Times. \"It is a massive social movement, whose supporters might retaliate or fight back.\"\n\nExiled Muslim Brotherhood leader Ibrahim Munir stated that protests would continue, calling the designation \"illegitimate.\" Reuters warns of the potential for further escalation in Egypt's political landscape.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Overcome Filibuster to Pass Debt Limit Extension\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans, in a surprising turn of events, managed to pass a House-passed bill to extend the debt limit unconditionally through 2014, overcoming a filibuster on Wednesday evening. The bill, initially expected to face significant opposition, was passed with weeks to spare before the deadline.\n\nHowever, the bill faced a brief stalemate on the Senate floor, with 58 votes - 55 from Democrats and three from Republicans - two votes short of the 60 required to break a filibuster and no GOP volunteers forthcoming. The delay was due to a collective action problem among Senate Republicans. While the group did not want to vote down the debt limit increase and face market panic, individual Republicans did not want their names associated with its passage.\n\nIn a crucial moment, Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, both in cycle this year, cast their votes to break the filibuster almost simultaneously. This cleared the threshold, and seven more Republicans joined them. Each of these team players seemed willing to provide cover for their colleagues but not if the leaders left them stranded after initiating the fight.\n\nAfter the bill's passage, the non-Cruz wing of the party expressed gratitude to McConnell for acting with courage and integrity. However, they could not say, but they knew full well, that McConnell and Cornyn had invited this situation upon themselves.\n\nFor three years, McConnell has characterized every debt limit increase as a favor President Obama has requested of Congress, a normatively bad thing Republicans would not agree to without some kind of equally partisan quid pro quo. This approach has left McConnell and other GOP leaders without a plausible explanation for their mounting defeats. By McConnell's own standard, he has done Obama's bidding multiple times now, most recently without pocketing even a pretense of a concession.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz declined to comment on whether McConnell should keep his leadership role in the next Congress, citing the decision as one for the voters of Kentucky to make. After the danger had passed, several of the Republicans who helped the debt limit bill clear the filibuster issued press releases boasting of their votes against final passage, a disingenuous distinction for them to draw.",
    " Title: Sylvia Burwell to Face Senate Confirmation Hearings for Healthcare Role Amidst Obamacare Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's nominee to replace Kathleen Sebelius, Sylvia Burwell, is set to face tough questions from the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee today. Burwell, the former White House Budget Director, is expected to be confirmed, but will likely be questioned extensively about the ongoing issues with Obamacare and her plans to address these problems moving forward.\n\nDuring the announcement of Burwell's nomination last month, President Obama praised her as a \"proven manager\" who is capable of delivering results. With the challenges ahead, her management skills will be crucial.\n\nRecently, Democrats and the administration have acknowledged issues with Obamacare that need to be addressed rather than repealing the legislation. Today, Burwell will be expected to detail these fixes and explain her plans to work with Congress to implement changes. The confirmation hearings provide Republicans with an opportunity to further scrutinize the new law and ask detailed questions about administration claims.\n\nThis week, it was revealed that many of Obamacare's reported eight million enrollees are duplicates, and last week, it was learned that only 67 percent of enrollees have paid their first premium. It will be interesting to see how Burwell defends the program.\n\nUpon her nomination, Burwell expressed her excitement about the opportunity to build on the achievements made by Kathleen Sebelius, President Obama, and others. If confirmed by the Senate, she looks forward to continuing the work of ensuring that children, families, and seniors have the building blocks for healthy and productive lives, whether it's through implementing the Affordable Care Act, supporting affordable childcare, or finding new ways to prevent and treat disease.",
    " Title: FBI Investigates Alleged Plot to Falsely Accuse Special Counsel Robert Mueller\n\nArticle:\n\nAn apparent attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly collapsed, and may have led some conservative activists into potential trouble with the FBI.\n\nIn a statement, Mueller's spokesperson said, \"When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the Special Counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation.\"\n\nThe details of the alleged scheme remain unclear, including its intended target. The incident came to light after pro-Trump Twitter personality Jacob Wohl hinted at such allegations on Monday night, causing concern among journalists who perceived it as a smear campaign.\n\nKey figures involved in the matter appear to be Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative known for his speedy, sycophantic replies to President Trump's tweets, making implausible and factually dubious claims, and running shady hedge funds. Another individual is Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, who has a history of making false claims about bombshell political information.\n\nIt is unclear if Wohl, Burkman, or both were involved in the plot to drum up these allegations, or if they were merely trolling the media. It is also possible that Wohl may have been deceiving Burkman to some extent.\n\nInvestigation into the matter led to the examination of Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company investigating these allegations. Wohl was evasive about his involvement in Surefire or the plot in general, while Burkman openly told Hill Reporter that \"Surefire is a real company\" run by \"Jacob Wohl.\"\n\nFurther investigation suggests that Surefire may be essentially Jacob Wohl, with no other individuals involved. It is unclear if Burkman, who insisted that Surefire was \"real,\" is also being deceived, or if he is a willing participant in this scheme.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the far-right conspiracist website Gateway Pundit, for which Wohl writes, published a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller. The document's author's name was blacked out, but it used a slogan that was also on the Surefire website. After much mockery on Twitter, Gateway Pundit's Jim Hoft took the document down and stated he was \"looking into\" the \"serious allegations against Jacob Wohl.\"\n\nThe FBI is now investigating the matter, as stated by Mueller's spokesperson on Tuesday. If this is merely a trolling attempt, it could be considered a success in drawing attention. However, if the purpose of the scheme was to troll journalists as much as to smear Mueller and the investigation, then the trolls may have achieved their goal.\n\nThe midterm elections are approaching, and this incident has reportedly diverted journalistic resources from other topics. Burkman still claims that he will reveal \"the first\" of Mueller's accusers at a press conference this Thursday. If this press conference follows the pattern of Burkman's previous ones, it will likely be uneventful. However, if the trolls' ultimate goal was to steal the spotlight and change the subject, then their plan may have succeeded.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Election: Roy Moore Files Lawsuit to Challenge Election Result\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican candidate Roy Moore has filed a lawsuit in an attempt to challenge the result of the recent Alabama Senate election, in which he lost to his Democrat rival Doug Jones. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday, a day before officials certified Mr. Jones as the winner, two weeks after the vote.\n\nMr. Moore was expected to win the election in the deeply conservative state, but his campaign was marred by allegations of child sexual misconduct. He refused to concede to Mr. Jones, who won narrowly by approximately 20,000 votes.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges voting irregularities in 20 precincts and calls for a fraud investigation and a new election. One of the election experts cited in the suit is Richard Charnin, a conspiracy theorist who also claims there was widespread voter fraud against Donald Trump in the presidential election.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Moore's lawyer said the purpose of the complaint was to \"preserve evidence of potential election fraud and to postpone the certification of Alabama's Special Election by Secretary of State John Merrill until a thorough investigation of potential election fraud, that improperly altered the outcome of this election.\"\n\nSecretary of State John Merrill told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Mr. Jones \"will be sworn in by Vice-President Pence on 3 January.\"\n\nConspiracy theories have spread in online conservative groups since the election, alleging without evidence that black voters were bussed in from other states to vote for Mr. Jones. Mr. Merrill has so far found no evidence of voter fraud, but pledged that his office would investigate any complaint submitted by Mr. Moore.\n\nThe election result was a blow to President Trump, who gave Mr. Moore his full-throated support, even as other Republicans distanced themselves following the misconduct allegations. Four women allege that Mr. Moore, then in his early thirties, assaulted, molested, or pursued them when they were teenagers, including sexually touching one when she was 14.\n\nMr. Moore denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated. His supporters, including his wife Kayla Moore, have promoted unfounded theories that his accusers were paid.\n\nThroughout his political career, Mr. Moore has provoked controversy, suggesting that 9/11 happened because of declining Christian values, calling for Muslims to be barred from office, and strongly opposing gay marriage.",
    " Title: Record Wall Street Contributions to GOP Candidates in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2023 midterm elections, a record 63% of political contributions from employees and corporations in the banking and investment sectors have gone to Republican candidates, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. This represents the largest dollar figure ($78 million) and percent for the GOP in any midterm election.\n\nThe increased donations are likely due to a strategic calculation that Republicans have a better chance of winning on Tuesday. Dorsey Farr, co-founder of French Wolf & Farr, an investment advisory firm in Atlanta, stated, \"You want to be with the winner. A lot of times you'll see companies give to both parties. If they see the tide turning, they'll go with the flow.\"\n\nThe figures do not include money channeled through political action committees, which have become increasingly prevalent in campaign finance in recent years. The boosted election expenditures from the financial world this time around also have to do with the fact that the Democratic Party has intensified its regulatory approach since the financial crisis.\n\nRay La Raja, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, explained, \"Democrats are just more of the regulatory party. In the past, bankers could work with any party. Now, all things equal, they'd rather work with Republicans.\"\n\nBeyond strategic calculations, there is also a philosophical element, with many on Wall Street feeling they have been demonized by the current administration. Major banks have paid out unprecedented multi-billion settlements in recent years for their role in the financial meltdown.\n\nIn a recent interview with Salon, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) criticized the president's economic team for favoring Wall Street over Main Street. Prominent 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also faced backlash for comments suggesting corporations and businesses do not create jobs.\n\nSenator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) was the top recipient of contributions from the investment community this election, having raised almost $1.9 million. Charles Schumer (D-New York), a traditional ally of Wall Street who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, pulled in about $850,000.\n\nLa Raja noted, \"I'm sure they're not going to piss off a powerful Democrat.\" However, he also pointed out that Wall Street has not completely abandoned Democrats, as the populist theme will continue to resonate with voters as long as the economic recovery remains sluggish for many Americans.\n\nIn contrast, La Raja stated, \"If all engines are running and the economy is doing well, populism dies.\" Despite the increased contributions to Republican candidates, it is unclear whether this trend will translate into electoral victories for the GOP.",
    " Title: Pope Francis Officially Opposes Death Penalty in All Circumstances, Calls for Global Abolition\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis has officially changed the teachings of the Catholic Church to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, the Vatican has announced. The Catechism of the Church, a codified doctrine which sums up the Church's teachings, had previously stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases.\n\nThe updated Catechism now states that the death penalty is \"inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person.\" Pope Francis has spoken out against executions in the past, and last October, he had stated that the Church's policy on the death penalty was one area where teaching was not static and could change with modern concerns.\n\nThe text of the catechism was first set by Pope John Paul II in October 1992, and earlier stated that the death penalty was \"an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.\" However, the new text argues that today's more effective detention methods protect citizens and \"do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.\"\n\nThe Church will now work with determination for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, according to a statement from the Holy See. The Catholic Church may base its faith on an unchanging Bible, but that does not stop the institution from updating some of its most important teachings.\n\nCenturies ago, popes called Christians to Holy War, commanded their own armies, and showed little anxiety about the killing of their enemies. In modern times, popes have re-invented themselves as symbols of global peace. But until now, the Church had taught that the death penalty was \"an acceptable, albeit extreme means of safeguarding the common good.\"\n\nPope Francis, who has made mercy a theme of his papacy, has now decided that this has to change by ruling the death penalty \"inadmissible.\" This may put the Church in direct conflict with conservative Catholics in the US who insist that capital punishment is justified.\n\nHistorically, the Church has mostly been unopposed to the death penalty, including into the 20th Century. In 1952, Pope Pius XII said it was not a violation of the universal right to life. Pope John Paul II argued for imprisonment over execution wherever possible, although Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI, wrote that the death penalty could be permissible.\n\nThe death penalty is still legal in 53 countries around the world. In the United States, where 22% of the population are Catholic, execution is still legal in 31 states. It is still also legal in Cuba, Dominica, and Uganda - where about half of their populations are Catholic. The only place in Europe where it is still legal is Belarus, which has a sizeable Catholic minority of about 7% of the population. Burkina Faso, Madagascar, and Benin, where significant chunks of the population follow Catholicism, have all outlawed the death penalty in recent years.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Distance Themselves from Chick-fil-A Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2012 U.S. presidential election, both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are navigating a cultural divide, with the issue of gay marriage serving as a flashpoint for activists on both sides. The recent controversy surrounding Chick-fil-A, a fast-food chain whose executives have expressed opposition to gay marriage, has become a topic of discussion in the election.\n\nPresident Obama, who supports gay marriage, has chosen to remain neutral on the issue regarding Chick-fil-A, a private company that operates primarily in red states. The president has been cautious on the issue, focusing on his efforts to dig the country out of the economic hole and avoiding alienating religious conservatives in the black community or blue-collar Democratic whites in key states like Ohio and Virginia.\n\nMitt Romney, who favors a constitutional amendment forbidding gay marriage, has also avoided discussing the Chick-fil-A controversy. Romney, who has praised Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy in the past, has not commented on the issue since May, when his son, Dan, sparked the latest controversy by stating that gay marriage invites \"God's judgment.\"\n\nBoth candidates are treading carefully, as stoking the base is crucial for both candidates in the election. Romney, who has been criticized for his evolving stance on gay marriage, has been advised by an adviser to keep the focus on his economic message and avoid distractions.\n\nRalph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, argues that Romney has ground to gain by engaging with the social conservative base on the issue. Reed stated, \"The vast majority of the American people, even those who might not agree with Dan Cathy\u2019s personal views, think that it was incorrect for Rahm Emanuel and the mayor of Boston to suggest that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to get a permit in their city.\" Reed added, \"I think anything for anybody running for office in either party right now would benefit from a trip to a Chick-fil-A franchise.\"\n\nIn summary, both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, have chosen to remain silent on the Chick-fil-A controversy, with Obama focusing on avoiding alienating religious conservatives and Romney aiming to keep the focus on his economic message. The issue of gay marriage and its impact on the election remains a topic of discussion among activists on both sides.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Grows at 3.5% in Q3, Consumer Spending Up 4%\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a 3.5% annual rate in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department. This growth rate is slower than the second quarter's 4.2%, but it puts the economy on pace for the fastest annual growth in 13 years.\n\nPrivate analysts had estimated a 3.4% growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter. Consumer spending jumped at a 4% rate in the July-September quarter, the fastest in about four years, and topping the 3.8% in the prior three months.\n\nThe strong showing reflects the fact that many people are in the job market, according to former White House economist Jared Bernstein. \"Lots of people are working and drawing paychecks,\" he said. \"Even if those paychecks are not growing as fast as we might like, that's going to fuel economic growth, and in this report, in fact, the strongest sector was consumer spending.\"\n\nThe travel industry was one sector that benefited from the increased spending. \"We set records around Labor Day and Memorial Day this year and Fourth of July in terms of travel,\" said Elie Maalouf, Americas CEO of IHG, the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and other chains.\n\nOverall growth may have been affected, in part, by Hurricane Florence, which flooded the Southeast U.S. in September. The Commerce Department said Florence resulted in losses of $37 billion in property and equipment. Earlier, Moody's Analytics estimated the economic cost of the storm at $38 billion to $50 billion. Hurricane Michael, which plowed through the Florida Panhandle and Georgia earlier this month, could affect fourth-quarter GDP.\n\nLast month, the Federal Reserve boosted its growth projection to 3.1% for 2018, but it saw growth slowing to 2.5% next year. The economy has been expanding in the 2% range in the past few years, but growth spiked in the second quarter, boosted by consumer spending and exports. However, exports decreased at a 3.5% pace in the third quarter after jumping 9.3% in the second quarter. Analysts had cautioned that the previous increase in exports was sparked by looming tariffs by China in its ongoing trade war with the United States. So they said that the export boom probably would not be sustained.\n\nWith unemployment at nearly 50-year lows, consumers have been confident enough to spend. The Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence rose in September, and retail sales grew 4.7% last month from a year earlier.\n\nHowever, the housing market is starting to slow, amid higher interest rates. Sales of new homes fell 5.5% in September\u2014the fourth monthly drop in a row\u2014and resales were down 3.4%.\n\nPresident Trump has been attacking the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates as the economy continues to recover from the Great Recession. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are approaching 5%, which may discourage some homebuying.",

The incident led to the victim's hospitalization, and he was found by police on Tuesday evening.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson stated at a news conference that the incident was investigated as a hate crime due to the victim's mental capacity, race, and other factors. The Facebook Live stream showing the attack has been deleted, but clips showing multiple people taunting, threatening, and hitting a man who is tied up in a corner have been posted by multiple outlets.\n\nThe assailants, who are black, reportedly say \"F * * * Donald Trump\" and \"F * * * white people\" on the video. They also force the victim, who is white, to repeat these phrases.\n\nThe four suspects were arrested after police were called to a residence near where they found the man and connected the incident and the location. The victim, a resident of a Chicago suburb, spent at least 24 hours in the company of his alleged assailants, one of whom he knew from school. He had been reported missing on Monday.\n\nA GoFundMe account has been set up for the victim, and the website will work with the campaign organizer to ensure all funds raised reach the victim.\n\nChicago police found the victim in distress on the street before they were aware of the existence of the Facebook live stream. The four suspects' remarks about President-elect Donald Trump are being investigated to determine whether they are \"sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.\"\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, Johnson highlighted the \"brazenness\" of the assailants for not just carrying out the attack but broadcasting it \"for all to see.\" He expressed his dismay at the incident, stating, \"It's sickening. It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Joe Heck Expresses Caution on U.S. Military Intervention in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Joe Heck (R-NV), a veteran and physician who served in the Army Reserve with three deployments, including Iraq, has expressed caution regarding the potential U.S. military intervention in Syria. He believes that the U.S. should proceed with caution before entering another Middle Eastern conflict due to concerns about the administration's disjointed foreign policy approach, unintended consequences of military action, lack of clear objectives, and the potential threat to U.S. national security interests.\n\nHeck stated that the atrocities committed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime are appalling and deserve international condemnation. However, he emphasized the need for a careful examination of the current situation and an understanding of the U.S.'s history in the region. He expressed concerns that a strike in Syria could further complicate the administration's foreign policy approach to the Middle East, as the U.S. has implemented three different strategies in Egypt, Libya, and Syria.\n\nThe congressman also raised concerns about the unintended consequences of a \"limited\" military strike, stating that such action could spark a wider regional conflict that would escalate U.S. involvement. He cited potential attacks against Syrian civilians, retaliation against Israel, and Syrian refugees flooding into neighboring countries as possible consequences.\n\nFurthermore, Heck criticized the administration for failing to clearly articulate the goals, objectives, and potential costs of a military action in Syria. He argued that the U.S. should only use military force when it is willing to \"sink the ship\" if the warning shot is unheeded, and he expressed doubts about the readiness of the U.S. military and the American people to engage in such action.\n\nHeck also questioned the case for a clear and imminent threat to U.S. national security interests, stating that while evil people will do evil things, the U.S. should not take on a situation that could produce the same result as the continued unrest in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. He emphasized the need for a clear threat to U.S. national security interests and a clear strategy of what the U.S. aims to achieve before engaging in military action.",

The headline \"Priebus struggles to explain GOP immigration messages\" from Politico refers to Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, who is tasked with clarifying the party's stance on immigration.\n\nThe disagreement stems from the responses to the president's speech. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, in her 10-minute reply, did not address immigration, while Florida Representative Carlos Curbelo, in a Spanish-language version of the GOP response, urged Obama to collaborate with Republicans to create permanent solutions for the immigration system, secure borders, and modernize legal immigration.\n\nIn another response, Florida Republican Representative Curt Clawson, in both English and Spanish, called for embracing legal immigrants and those waiting in line legally to pursue their American Dream. This response was not the only point of contention, as Iowa Representative Steve King caused some awkwardness with a rude Twitter slam against Obama for inviting a \"deportable\" to sit in the House gallery as a guest of the First Lady. The individual, 20-year-old Ana Zamora, was brought to the United States illegally as an infant and benefited from Obama's 2012 executive order that extended legal status to thousands of similarly situated immigrants.\n\nWhen asked about King's tone, Republican presidential hopeful Senator Marco Rubio responded carefully, stating, \"We have to always remind ourselves that we're talking about human beings with hopes and dreams and families.\"\n\nThe clear element of the GOP message on immigration is the lack of a unified stance on the issue. The subject was barely mentioned in the president's address, but the Republican opposition still found themselves in an intramural tangle over it.\n\nWhile a boisterous battle over policy and principle is a sign of fitness, not feebleness, for a large political party, the current rumble over immigration policy is heartening, especially when the argument focuses on ideals and values and reflects a thoughtful interest in crafting wise, not merely popular, public policy.\n\nIn a new monograph from Encounter Books, \"Open Immigration: Yea & Nay,\" Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies and Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute provide a brief yet splendid example of how uplifting the debate over immigration can be. Each author lays out his case in prose that is clear, quick, factual, and respectful.\n\nKrikorian, a well-known immigration restrictionist, argues that while mass immigration may have suited the United States in the 19th century, it is harmful in the 21st century. He poses security and economic threats, undermines assimilation, and retards productivity gains by flooding the market with cheap labor. Krikorian proposes slashing the annual influx from 1 million to about 400,000, still higher than any other nation in the world.\n\nNowrasteh, on the other hand, wants more legal immigration. He argues that America is not being swamped with newcomers\u2014far from it. As a fraction of the population, immigrant inflows are small compared to most developed countries. Every policy generates stresses and strains, he notes, but there is no question that immigration enlarges the US economic pie. \"A freer immigration system would not only be economically beneficial to the United States,\" Nowrasteh argues, \"but it would also be consistent with our principles of limited government, free markets, and individual liberty.\"\n\nThese dueling essays are a pleasure to read. Each advocate strengthens his case, paradoxically, by granting that the other side raises serious challenges and attempting to meet them. To be sure, Krikorian and Nowrasteh are not politicians, ravenous for votes and approval ratings. But their debate exemplifies what is possible even on such an incendiary issue.\n\nIt's true: Republicans and others on the right, battling it out over immigration, seem awfully fractious and confused these days. For those who take their ideas seriously, that's often how the democratic process works.",
    " Title: Trump's Election Marks a Shift Towards Saying \"Merry Christmas\" Again, According to Christian Leader\n\nArticle:\n\nA Christian leader, Dr. Richard Land, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary, has stated that President-elect Donald Trump is fulfilling his promise to make it acceptable to say \"Merry Christmas\" again in the United States. In an interview with Charisma News, Dr. Land noted a shift in the country's tone since the 2016 election, with many people expressing relief at being able to say \"Merry Christmas\" without fear of criticism.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump often referenced Christmas, tapping into the perceived \"War on Christmas\" at the highest levels of government, including the White House, during the Obama administration. Now, Trump is following through on his promise. During his \"thank you\" tour, he frequently mentions \"Merry Christmas\" in his speeches and is often flanked by two Christmas trees on stage.\n\nIn contrast, President Barack Obama's family Christmas card during his eight-year presidency has omitted the phrase \"Merry Christmas,\" instead using the politically correct \"Happy Holidays.\" The Washington Times reported that the message on the Obama family card this season reads, \"As our family reflects on our many happy years spent in the White House, we are grateful for the friends we've made, the joy we've shared, and the gifts of kindness we've received. We wish you and your loved ones a joyous holiday season and a wonderful new year.\"\n\nChristians, who made up a significant portion of Trump's voter base, are reportedly pleased with the change. According to Dr. Land, Trump's presidency will foster a federal government more friendly to traditional Christian beliefs in the public square. He noted that Americans are enjoying their newfound rights to communicate their true beliefs about Christmas.\n\nDr. Land also stated that this shift is a win for cultural conservatism, which is intertwined with orthodox, traditional Christianity in America, over progressivism and multiculturalism.",
    " Title: Democratic Senators File Unprecedented Brief Attacking Supreme Court Justices' Integrity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, five Democratic members of the United States Senate have filed a legal brief attacking the integrity of the five Republican-appointed justices of the Supreme Court. The brief, filed in the case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. the City of New York, alleges that the Court's decisions are politically motivated and threatens political action if the Court does not rule in a manner favorable to the senators' demands.\n\nThe brief, which is highly unusual in its tone and content, is not a traditional legal argument but rather a personal attack on the Court itself. The senators, Sheldon Whitehouse, Mazie Hirono, Richard Blumenthal, Richard Durbin, and Kirsten Gillibrand, have accused the Court of being influenced by corporate and Republican interests, and of disregarding \"conservative\" judicial principles like judicial restraint, originalism, stare decisis, and federalism.\n\nThe brief's ostensible purpose is to support the city and state of New York's claims that the case is moot and should be dismissed. However, the true intent of the brief is to cast aspersions on the integrity of the Court. The senators ask the Court to dismiss the case to \"stem the growing public belief that its decisions are'motivated mainly by politics.'\"\n\nThe brief cites the number of 5-4 decisions in which justices appointed by Republican presidents provided all five votes in the majority, and argues that these decisions were influenced by the partisan interests of the Republican Party. The brief does not acknowledge the competing judicial philosophies of the justices or the frequent voting together of Democratic- and Republican-appointed justices.\n\nThe senators' brief has been widely criticized as an attack on the independence of the Court and a threat to its integrity. The Supreme Court is not well, and the people know it, the brief suggests, implying that the Court needs to heal itself before the public demands it be \"restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.\"\n\nIt is unclear what political action the senators are threatening, and it is also unclear what the outcome of the case will be. However, the filing of the brief is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the role of politics in the Supreme Court and the integrity of its justices.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Industry in Overdrive as Trump and Clinton Face Off\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 U.S. presidential election has put the fact-checking industry into high gear, with both major candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, facing numerous allegations of dishonesty. The Associated Press assigned 12 reporters to fact-check a recent speech by Trump, a move that Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple described as \"a whole platoon of journalistic talent that could have been doing other things.\"\n\nAngie Drobnic Holan, editor in chief of the Pulitzer Prize-winning site PolitiFact.com, remains optimistic about the growth of media fact-checking. \"Donald Trump is a candidate who has persistent problems with accuracy, and I'm heartened that there's widespread recognition that this is someone who needs to be fact-checked,\" she says.\n\nTrump supporters, such as Jeffrey Lord, a regular on CNN defending Trump, call media fact-checkers \"elitist\" and argue that the candidates themselves do a better job of countering each other's assumptions. This \"self-policing\" concept is compared to having a basketball game with no referees.\n\nThe concept of political speech includes out-and-out lies, unintentional falsehoods, exaggerations, and spin. Sorting through the differences can be challenging, as it requires knowing what's inside the speaker's head. Making pie-in-the-sky promises is one thing, but statements of fact that prove false are another, and that's where fact-checkers are having a field day.\n\nPolitiFact has judged 174 statements by Trump so far, finding only 16 to be either true or mostly true. Seventy have been judged false, and another 34 rated \"Pants on Fire,\" referring to claims that are \"not only inaccurate but also ridiculous,\" according to Ms. Holan. With Clinton, PolitiFact has judged 218 statements and rated 112 true or mostly true, 24 false, and three \"Pants on Fire.\"\n\nThe question is whether the assessments of PolitiFact and other fact-checkers actually penetrate public consciousness. Holan says that her site's traffic is better than ever, and media organizations are doing fact-checking in part because it's popular with readers. However, Professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, is less sanguine. \"Fact-checking has never been more important, more complicated, and less likely to reach its target audience with the desired corrected information,\" Jamieson says.\n\nPart of the problem is the ever-accelerating news cycle, and another issue is low public opinion of the media. Only 6 percent of Americans have a \"great deal of confidence\" in the press, according to a survey released in April by the Media Insight Project. Holan of PolitiFact says that when readers accuse her site of partisan bias against Trump, she counters with data that show Republicans who do well on the PolitiFact \"Truth-o-Meter,\" such as Jeb Bush. However, former Governor Bush didn't do very well as a presidential candidate, and voters don't necessarily favor a candidate because he or she is more factual. Moreover, for a slice of the electorate, this cycle reflects a break from politics as usual\u2014and that includes an embrace of candidates who speak to voters without the filter of polls, focus groups, and scripted statements.",
    " Title: Tariffs and Soybeans: Economic and Political Consequences for the GOP\n\nArticle:\n\nTariffs, as a result of the ongoing trade war with China, have both economic and political implications, particularly for the Republican Party in the upcoming midterm elections. The soybean, being the world's top-produced crop in the U.S. and the largest consumer being China, is at the heart of this issue. Last year, China purchased over $14 billion of American-grown soybeans, accounting for 61 percent of total U.S. soybean exports and more than 30 percent of overall U.S. soybean production.\n\nIn response to President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on over 1,300 Chinese-made goods last month, China has threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans and other American agricultural products. This potential tariff could impact key congressional races across the Midwest, where states like Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and North Dakota are significant soybean producers.\n\nThe New York Times has dispatched a reporter to Cass County, North Dakota, the nation's top soybean-producing county, to gauge farmers' opinions about Trump's trade skirmishes with China. Robert Runck, a fourth-generation farmer, told the paper that if Trump \"doesn't understand what he's doing to the nation by doing what he's doing, he's going to be a one-term president, plain and simple.\" Runck also stated that tariffs would cost Republican congressman Kevin Cramer, who currently represents North Dakota, some votes. Cramer is running against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D\u2013N.D.) in November.\n\nAn analysis from the Brookings Institution suggests that Trump's tariffs will do the most damage to the economies of red states, including Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The potential Chinese tariffs on American agricultural products are expected to cause much of the pain in the Midwest.\n\nTrump's tariffs are part of his campaign promise to revive American steel plants. However, the protectionist policies could harm a much larger group within the president's political coalition, as for every steel-producing job in the country, there are about 46 steel-consuming jobs, many of which are now on shakier ground due to the higher costs created by tariffs.\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove told the Times that Trump \"has little to no understanding of the farm coalition.\" Trump, a New Yorker who ran hotels and casinos before becoming a TV star, does not have a background that suggests a detailed understanding of the concerns of a North Dakota farmer or an Ohio machine shop worker.\n\nTrump's unwillingness to court rural voters in a traditional manner was one of the things that set him apart during the campaign. However, it remains to be seen whether voters will continue to support a president whose policies make their jobs more difficult or their lifestyle more costly.\n\nTrump won the American heartland in part by promising to end a regulatory war on agricultural and industrial jobs, and he has been following through on that promise. However, he now risks replacing one set of oppressive economic policies with another, putting farmers and manufacturers on the front lines of a trade war. The fact that he's not directly responsible for Chinese tariffs on soybeans might not save Trump, or the rest of his party, from the ire of those who suffer the consequences of these myopic trade policies.\n\nIt's a political clich\u00e9 that people vote with their wallets. This may hold true even for a president who shattered so many other traditional notions of how to get elected.",
    " Title: Clinton Tries to Regroup and Appeal to Democratic Party Establishment as Primary Race Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the former U.S. Secretary of State and current Democratic presidential candidate, has been facing scrutiny over her private email account during her tenure as Secretary of State. This, coupled with the rising poll numbers of her primary rival, Bernie Sanders, and the potential entry of Vice President Joe Biden into the race, has led to a shift in Clinton's strategy.\n\nIn an effort to regain control of the narrative and appeal to the Democratic Party establishment, Clinton addressed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in Minneapolis on Friday. She emphasized her lifelong commitment to fighting for families and underdogs and her determination to continue her campaign.\n\nClinton stated, \"I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not going to stop now. In fact, I'm just getting warmed up.\" She also pledged not to take any primary voter or caucusgoer for granted.\n\nHowever, party leaders are growing concerned that Clinton has not effectively addressed the email controversy, which has created uncertainty and given other candidates an opportunity. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, saw a boost in his poll numbers over the weekend, trailing Clinton by only 7 points in an Iowa poll.\n\nSanders, in a veiled critique of Clinton, argued that the traditional approach to politics is no longer effective in energizing Democratic voters. He attributed the party's losses in the 2014 midterm elections to low voter turnout, particularly among the liberal base.\n\n\"We lost because voter turnout was abysmally, embarrassingly low, and millions of working people, young people, and people of color gave up on politics as usual and they stayed home,\" Sanders said. He further emphasized that the same old approach will not work in generating enthusiasm among voters.\n\nFormer Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley also criticized the Democratic establishment, repeating his criticism of the debate schedule and describing it as a \"rigged process\" and \"a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debates.\"\n\nVice President Biden did not attend the meeting in Minneapolis, but he has been considering entering the race and has been discussing his decision with his family. In a conference call last week, Biden told DNC members that if he runs, he wants to give the campaign his whole heart and soul.\n\nAhead of her speech, Clinton released a series of memos highlighting her organizational strength in the four early voting states. She campaigned in Iowa last week with Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor. Vilsack was asked about the potential awkwardness of endorsing Clinton while Biden is considering a run. He responded, \"I love Joe Biden\u2014just like we all do. He's a wonderful man. But campaigns require difficult choices, and I and my wife are supporting Clinton.\"\n\nSome DNC members have already endorsed Clinton, and it may be too late for Biden in their eyes. Florida committeeman Jon M. Ausman told Politico in Minneapolis, \"He doesn't reach out to me for seven f*cking years and then he wants me to help him out? I don't think so. I don't really give a f*ck. I don't care if he gets into the race or not.\"\n\nBy releasing early endorsements, Clinton is attempting to demonstrate her strength and deter a potential Biden entry into the race. According to Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, Elleithee is also the immediate past DNC communications director and worked for Clinton's 2008 campaign, Biden will not have a significant presence in the race if Clinton has secured support from key party members.\n\n\"[Biden] will not have oxygen in the room if she has locked people down,\" Elleithee said. \"I think he is probably looking at the field and saying, 'OK, at this late date in the process, can I build the organization? Can I raise the money? And can my message break through?'\"\n\nClinton, when asked about Biden, expressed sympathy for his difficult decision and stated that she wants to give him the space and time to make it. She also acknowledged that she learned some lessons from her primary loss to President Obama in 2008, stating, \"I got a lot of votes, but I did not\u2014I did not get enough delegates. And so, I think it's understandable that my focus is going to be on delegates as well as votes this time.\"",
    " Title: Germanwings Flight 9525: Pilot Locked Out of Cockpit Before Crash, According to New York Times Report\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators probing the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 have made a startling discovery in an audio recording, according to a report by The New York Times. The report suggests that one of the plane's pilots was locked out of the cockpit before the crash.\n\nA senior military official involved in the investigation told The New York Times that audio from the cockpit voice recorder, one of the plane's black boxes, indicates that one of the pilots was trying to gain entry to the cockpit.\n\n\"You can hear he is trying to smash the door down,\" the official said, describing the audio. \"We don't know yet the reason why one of the guys went out,\" the official added. \"But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door.\"\n\nLufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, said it was looking into the report. \"We have no information from the bodies investigating the incident that would corroborate the report in The New York Times,\" spokesman Boris Ogursky said. \"We will not participate in speculation, but we will follow up on the matter.\"\n\nThe Times' report is a \"terribly shocking revelation,\" CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz said. But he and other experts cautioned that it's still unclear what could have been going on inside the cockpit. Possibilities range from a medical emergency to something more nefarious, like a suicide mission.\n\nOfficials previously said that they hadn't ruled out terrorism, but it seems unlikely. French authorities revealed earlier Wednesday that they'd been able to access audio from the recorder, even though its external casing was damaged. But they disclosed few details about what the recording actually contained, saying only that there was one audio channel with voices on it that went all the way up to the time of the crash.\n\nInvestigators are still trying to piece together what caused the crash. The plane's second black box, the flight data recorder, has not been found yet, but Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Wednesday that there's a high probability it will be. The mountainous terrain where the Germanwings jet went down is difficult to access.\n\nTeams have begun the daunting task of identifying the victims' bodies, but caution that it could take time to complete. The doomed flight was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed Tuesday in the French Alps.",
    " Title: U.S., Russia Discuss Chemical Weapons in Syria as Peace Talks Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the potential for a new peace conference in Geneva regarding the Syrian civil war on Friday. The talks revolve around the Syrian government's commitment to relinquish its chemical weapons arsenal.\n\nThe discussions took place as United Nations-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met with Kerry and Lavrov, while American and Russian chemical weapons experts negotiated technical details crucial to a deal on chemical weapons in a nearby hotel. The looming threat of a limited U.S. military strike against President Bashar Assad's regime hangs over the negotiations.\n\nBrahimi acknowledged the high stakes, stating that the chemical weapons negotiation is significant in itself but also essential for the success of the planned Geneva peace conference. More than 100,000 people have been killed in two years of civil war. On Friday, international group Human Rights Watch accused the Syrian government and militias fighting on its side of carrying out summary executions that killed at least 248 people in two towns in May.\n\nKerry, flanked by Lavrov and Brahimi, told reporters after an hour-long meeting that the prospects for a second peace conference in Geneva depend on the outcome of the chemical weapons talks, which have been \"constructive\" so far. Kerry stated that President Barack Obama is committed to a negotiated solution for Syria, and the U.S. is working hard to find common ground to make that happen.\n\nKerry, Lavrov, and Brahimi agreed to meet around Sept. 28 on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly high-level meetings in New York. However, the future of peace negotiations depends on the outcome of the weapons talks.\n\nBrahimi also met privately with Kerry on Thursday to explore ways to resume international negotiations last held in Geneva in June 2012, aimed at ending the Syrian civil war.\n\nLavrov stated that Russia has supported the peace process from the start of the Syrian conflict and discussed with Kerry and Brahimi the Geneva communique from the 2012 meeting on Syria and ways of preparing for a second conference.\n\nWhen the chemical weapons talks began on Thursday, Kerry rejected a Syrian pledge to begin a \"standard process\" by turning over information rather than weapons, stating that this was not acceptable.\n\nSyrian National Coalition senior member Salem Al Meslet expressed disappointment that the Kerry and Lavrov meeting on chemical weapons wasn't about punishing Assad. He stated, \"They are leaving the murderer and concentrating on the weapons he was using. It is like stabbing somebody with a knife then they take the knife away and he is free.\"\n\nThe talks are the latest in a rapidly moving series of events following the Aug. 21 gas attack on suburbs in Damascus. The U.S. blames Assad for the use of chemical weapons, while Assad denies his government was involved and instead points to the rebels fighting a 2-year-old civil war against it.\n\nPresident Obama began trying to win support at home and abroad for a punitive military strike on Assad's forces, but put that effort on hold when the Syrian government expressed willingness to turn over weapons to international control. Obama dispatched Kerry to Geneva to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of U.S. military action.\n\nAs of Friday, the United Nations is still reviewing Syria's documents submitted to join the international treaty banning chemical weapons to determine if they provide enough information. If accepted as complete, Syria would become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention 30 days later. Syria's ambassador to the United Nations stated that, as of Thursday when it submitted the documents, his country had become a full member of the treaty, which requires destruction of all chemical weapons.\n\nAssad, in an interview with Russia's Rossiya-24 TV, said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention. He also stated that the Russian proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the U.S. halted threats of military action.\n\nAt a meeting in Kyrgyzstan on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated, \"I would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the Syrian crisis.\"",
    " Title: Trump and Sanders Debate Proposal: A Temporary Pause in Campaign Activities\n\nArticle:\n\nA potential debate between former President Donald Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders has caused a flurry of speculation, with both candidates expressing interest in a charity debate, only to later clarify that the proposal was made in jest.\n\nDuring a press conference in Bismarck, North Dakota, on Thursday, Trump reiterated his willingness to debate Sanders for charity, stating, \"I'd love to debate Bernie \u2013 he's a dream. The problem with debating Bernie is he's going to lose [the Democratic race]... but I'd debate him anyway. We've already had a couple of calls from the networks, so we'll see.\"\n\nTrump's initial expression of interest in debating Sanders during an appearance on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday had been dismissed by his campaign as a joke earlier in the day. Trump's campaign later clarified that the Republican was not serious about the prospect of a debate.\n\nSenator Sanders, who is currently trailing Hillary Clinton in the delegate race to secure the Democratic nomination, responded to Trump's initial proposal with a tweet, stating, \"Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.\"\n\nSanders' campaign confirmed they were serious about the opportunity if Trump was, but an aide to Trump clarified on Thursday that the former reality TV star was joking and had no intention to actually debate Sanders.\n\nA debate between candidates from both parties before the conclusion of the nominating process would have been highly unusual and potentially complicated for Clinton, who turned down an invitation from Fox News to debate Sanders earlier this week, citing the need to focus on the looming general election campaign.\n\nA debate during the remainder of the primary season would have been more beneficial to Sanders, offering him another public platform to make his case in what has been a grueling contest against Clinton. The senator has often referred to poll numbers on the stump that show him faring better than Clinton in a hypothetical match-up against Trump, although Clinton has countered that she has spent more than two decades in the public eye, whereas Sanders has yet to be vetted at the national level.\n\nTrump, although evidently unwilling to debate the senator, has made overtures toward Sanders' supporters by echoing their complaints that the establishment is working in Clinton's favor. \"The system is rigged against him,\" Trump told Kimmel, referring to Sanders. \"I think it's very unfair.\"\n\nSanders and Clinton last faced off on the debate stage on March 9 in Miami. Since then, Clinton has moved significantly closer to securing the nomination but has still lost a series of contests to Sanders along the way.\n\nSanders has repeatedly charged that the Democratic National Committee, which remains officially neutral in the primary, is aiding Clinton by limiting debates and scheduling them on weekends when there would be less of an audience. The senator's disdain for party leaders escalated last week, when Sanders said he would not reappoint Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chair of the DNC if elected president and endorsed her primary opponent as she seeks re-election to Congress in south Florida.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist and founder of the center-left think tank New Democrat Network, wrote in a column this week that the California debate should proceed as initially planned between Clinton and Sanders. \"For the DNC to walk away from the debate now, given that Sanders has signaled his desire to proceed, will only confirm the worst suspicions of Sanders partisans,\" Rosenberg wrote.",
    " Title: The New York Times Endorses Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar for Democratic Presidential Nomination\n\nThe New York Times editorial board has endorsed Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) for the Democratic nomination for president, marking a break in convention as the first primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire are set to take place in two weeks.\n\nIn the endorsement, the Times stated, \"Choosing who should face off against [President] Trump also means acknowledging that Americans are being confronted with three models for how to govern this country, not two.\" The editorial board further explained, \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re endorsing the most effective advocates for each approach. They are Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.\"\n\nThe endorsement comes as Warren's campaign faces a new challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose campaign has recently secured a number of high-profile endorsements from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).\n\nWarren and Sanders clashed onstage at last week's CNN debate in Des Moines over whether Sanders had told Warren that a woman could not be elected president in the U.S. In their endorsement, the Times wrote that Warren could serve as a vehicle for progressives who worry that Sanders' message is too divisive.\n\nThe Times' editors wrote of Klobuchar that the Minnesota senator should take control of the centrist lane currently headed by former Vice President Joe Biden, whom the Times advised should \"pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders.\" Klobuchar, they added, \"is the very definition of Midwestern charisma, grit, and sticktoitiveness. Her lengthy tenure in the Senate and bipartisan credentials would make her a deal maker (a real one) and uniter for the wings of the party\u2014and perhaps the nation.\"\n\nThe Times previously endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the eventual winner of the Democratic nomination in 2016, before going on to endorse her in the general election as well. The Times ended its endorsement Sunday night with a call for voters to rally behind whichever woman they thought best represented their values: \"Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren right now are the Democrats best equipped to lead that debate. May the best woman win.\"",
    " Title: Wisconsin Allowed to Enforce Voter Identification Law in November Elections, According to Federal Appeals Court\n\nArticle:\n\nA three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has unanimously stayed a district court judge's order blocking the enforcement of a new voter identification law in Wisconsin or any similar measure imposing new voter identification requirements. The State of Wisconsin may, if it wishes and if it is appropriate under state law, enforce the photo ID requirement in this November's elections.\n\nThe appeals court's order, released Friday afternoon, states, \"Having read the briefs and heard oral argument, this court now stays the injunction issued by the district court. The State of Wisconsin may, if it wishes (and if it is appropriate under rules of state law), enforce the photo ID requirement in this November\u2019s elections.\"\n\nThe court added that the district court held the state law invalid and enjoined its implementation, even though it is materially identical to Indiana\u2019s photo ID statute, which the Supreme Court held valid in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board in 2008.\n\nThe state had asked the appeals court to lift the district judge's order, arguing that it was overbroad. Civil rights groups challenging the measure could ask for relief from the full bench of the 7th Circuit or from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe appeals court noted that a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in July narrowed the new law in ways that made it less likely to have a negative impact on minorities. \"This reduces the likelihood of irreparable injury, and it also changes the balance of equities and thus the propriety of federal injunctive relief,\" the 7th Circuit wrote.\n\nThe move is a rebuff to the Obama Administration, which filed an amicus brief in July urging the appeals court to uphold the lower court's ruling. Technically, the appeals court panel did not decide the case Friday, but simply stayed the lower court's order pending a full resolution of the appeal. The appeal was heard by Judges Frank Easterbrook, Diane Sykes, and John Tinder. Easterbrook was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, while Sykes and Tinder were appointed by President George W. Bush.",
    " Title: Trump Announces General H.R. McMaster as National Security Advisor, John R. Bolton to Find New Role\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced that General H.R. McMaster will remain as the National Security Council's chief of staff, following the resignation of Michael Flynn a week ago. McMaster, a retired lieutenant general, was one of four candidates interviewed by Trump on Sunday for the permanent position. The status of K.T. McFarland, the top deputy national security adviser, remains unclear.\n\nIn a statement, McMaster expressed gratitude to Trump for the opportunity and expressed his intention to contribute to the national security team. \"I'm grateful to you for that opportunity,\" he told the president, \"and I look forward to joining the national security team and doing everything that I can to advance and protect the interests of the American people.\"\n\nJohn R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, was another finalist for the position. Bolton, an outspoken conservative, was previously considered for a high-level post in Trump's administration. Trump praised Bolton on Monday, stating that they had productive meetings and that Bolton had many ideas he agreed with. \"We had some really good meetings with him. Knows a lot,\" the president said. \"He had a good number of ideas that I must tell you I agree very much with. So we\u2019ll be talking with John Bolton in a different capacity.\"\n\nGeneral McMaster has served as the director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center at Fort Eustis in Virginia since 2014. A West Point graduate with a doctorate in military history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he commanded a unit that clashed with Iraq's Republican Guard in one of the biggest tank battles of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, earning him the Silver Star.\n\nMcMaster came to prominence with his 1997 book, \"Dereliction of Duty,\" which critiqued the Joint Chiefs for not standing up to President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War. He cemented his reputation in 2005 during the second Iraq war when he led the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment in regaining control of Tal Afar. The operation was cited as a textbook example in a manual on counterinsurgency doctrine prepared by General Petraeus. Another commander who had a role in drafting that manual was General Mattis, then a Marine general. General Petraeus took a similar approach when he assumed command in Iraq in 2007 with a surge of troops authorized by President George W. Bush.",
    " Title: Federal Court Upholds DACA, Citing Presidential \"Racial Animus\" as Grounds for Invalidation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, ruling that President Donald Trump's administration cannot rescind the program through executive action. The decision, which has been met with controversy, is based on the court's interpretation of the Trump administration's process and reasons for abolishing the policy, as well as allegations of \"racial animus.\"\n\nThe court's decision is not a straightforward affirmation of DACA's legality, but rather a complex ruling that criticizes the Trump administration's approach to rescinding the policy. The court found that the administration's reasons for abolishing DACA were defective, as the policy was not issued pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, and the litigation risk from a challenge to DACA was not considered a grounds for the action.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge John Owens agrees that the Trump administration is barred from rescinding DACA, not for the technical reasons outlined in the majority opinion, but because of alleged \"racial animus.\" In a footnote, the other two judges on the panel write that they agree with Judge Owens' reasoning. This suggests that, according to the judges, Trump's personal biases disqualify him from taking actions that any other president might be permitted to take.\n\nThis is not the first time federal judges have used similar reasoning to challenge Trump's policies. In the case of the travel bans on immigration from certain countries, judges found that Trump could not be permitted to implement such bans because they determined that he was biased against certain groups. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, put an end to such psychoanalysis from the bench and let most of the travel ban go into effect.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the president has the authority to exercise the same powers as any other president, regardless of personal opinions about the president's character and behavior. The power of the president is circumscribed by the constitution and federal law, not the opinion of judges about the present occupant. The American people elected Donald Trump president, and he is entitled to exercise the same authority as any other president within the bounds of the constitutional order.",
    " Title: Clinton's Position on Iran's Nuclear Ambitions Remains Consistent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent conversation, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that her stance on Iran's nuclear ambitions has remained consistent, advocating for little to no enrichment for Iran. Clinton, who served as the U.S.'s chief negotiator on the issue during the Obama administration, emphasized that there is no inherent right to enrich uranium, a position she has maintained throughout her political career.\n\nWhen asked about the perceived shift in her position compared to the current administration's negotiators, Clinton clarified that she does not speak for the current administration but emphasized the importance of sending a clear signal that a deal cannot be reached without stringent restrictions on Iran. She suggested that the preference would be no enrichment, with the potential fallback position being such limited enrichment that Iran would be unable to break out of the agreed-upon limitations.\n\nClinton acknowledged that there is a debate within Iran about the extent to which they should compromise in order to secure relief from sanctions. She noted that the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany) still maintains a unified position, which includes intensive inspections, clear limits on Iran's nuclear facilities, and a strict approach to enrichment.\n\nWhen asked about the Iranians' unwillingness to pull back and freeze their nuclear program, Clinton expressed uncertainty, suggesting that there may be a political debate within Iran about the potential benefits of a strict nuclear regime in exchange for sanctions relief. She pointed out that Iran is dealing with various domestic and regional challenges, including Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and potentially Hamas.\n\nClinton's comments provide insight into her continued opposition to Iran's nuclear ambitions and her belief in the importance of maintaining a firm stance in negotiations with Iran. However, the former Secretary of State also acknowledged the complexity of the situation and the potential for political maneuvering within Iran.",
    " Title: Biden Defends Past Work with Segregationist Senators Amidst Criticism in Democratic Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has refused to apologize for reminiscing on his work with two late senators who were known for their support of racial segregation. The former U.S. vice-president, who is currently leading opinion polls, has faced criticism for his comments regarding his working relationship with Mississippi's James Eastland and Georgia's Herman Talmadge, whom he served alongside in the Senate in the 1970s.\n\nAt a fundraiser in New York City, Biden recalled that Talmadge had called him \"son\" but never \"boy,\" a term racist whites used to address black men during that time. He also stated, \"At least there was some civility; we got things done.\"\n\nSeveral of Biden's Democratic rivals, including Senator Cory Booker and California Senator Kamala Harris, have criticized his remarks. Harris, who is black, stated that Biden did not seem to understand \"the dark history of our country.\" Booker, also black, called it \"so insulting\" that Biden had asked him to apologize.\n\nHowever, Biden defended himself on Wednesday night, telling reporters, \"There's not a racist bone in my body; I've been involved in civil rights my whole career.\" He added, \"We, in fact, detested what they stood for in terms of segregation and all the rest.\"\n\nAnita Dunn, a Biden advisor, told MSNBC that the story was one Biden had told many times. She explained, \"The point of the story is that you have to be able to work with people, even if they hold positions repugnant to you, in order to make some progress.\"\n\nNot all Democratic lawmakers have criticized Biden. House of Representatives majority whip Jim Clyburn, who is African-American, defended Biden, stating, \"You do not have to agree with people to work with them.\" Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi also supported Biden, saying his comments were not what the election was about.\n\nThe Democratic candidates will travel to South Carolina this weekend to court support from black voters. Biden will be attending the traditional fish fry picnic, which is hosted by Clyburn. Biden has capitalized on his time as deputy to President Barack Obama, the first-ever black U.S. president, who is still revered among Democrats. Biden launched his campaign in April by condemning President Donald Trump's response to a racist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.",
    " Title: U.S. Food Supply Chain Remains Stable Despite Pandemic, but Labor Challenges Persist\n\nArticle:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused widespread disruptions to various industries, and the food supply chain is no exception. In the early stages of the pandemic, Americans rushed to stock up on food, leading to temporary shortages in some grocery stores. However, a shortage of food supplies in the U.S. is unlikely in the foreseeable future, as the country still produces more than enough food to meet its needs.\n\nThe pandemic, however, has exposed vulnerabilities in the food supply chain, particularly in the labor-intensive sectors that rely on underpaid, overexploited workers. \"The worry in the food supply chain was always about activities that were labor-intensive, and where there weren't proper procedures to protect the people doing the work: produce workers, warehouse employees, transport workers, and store employees,\" said Ananth Iyer, a professor of operations management at Purdue University.\n\nIn recent weeks, grocery store workers and farm laborers have started contracting and dying from Covid-19 in increasing numbers. In some places, the disease is already pushing people to a breaking point. This week, a massive meat-processing plant in Minnesota became the latest to shut down after a Covid-19 outbreak among workers. Many employers have continued pressing employees to work in unsafe and exploitative conditions, raising the possibility of more illnesses and shutdowns to come.\n\nThe economic impact of the pandemic is likely to land hard on these workers when the pandemic ends. Shifting consumption patterns mean that industries maniacally focused on efficiency will likely slash employment levels. Among the victims could also be food service workers\u2014presently frozen out of jobs amid the shutdown\u2014who could return to an economy where far fewer people are willing to venture outside to eat.\n\n\"It's estimated that in the United States, 50 to 55 percent of food consumption normally takes place outside the home, at restaurants, fast food outlets, and entertainment venues,\" added Iyer. \"All of a sudden, that came to a complete halt, and now the question is whether we will even go back to that. If we don't, there will be serious adjustments in the restaurant industry affecting the millions of people who work there.\"\n\nThe agricultural industry looks ready to place the burden onto its most exploited workers by cutting the wages of migrant farm laborers. In this, they have a willing ally in the White House. In the name of supporting farmers, the Trump administration is proposing a new \"wage relief\" program to allow agricultural firms to cut migrant workers' salaries to save money during the pandemic. The proposal has gone largely under the radar while the country reels from news of Covid-19 deaths and job losses. But it may have serious consequences for what American society looks like when people eventually emerge from quarantine.\n\n\"At the moment, the agriculture industry recognizes that the social turmoil caused by the pandemic has created something like a fog of war, in which they can press for lots of things that society normally would have no tolerance for,\" said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's a basic principle of economics that if you successfully cut wages at the lowest rung of the economy, it is going to have a ripple effect up through the blue-collar range. To put it another way, if you depress the wages for the poorest people, you depress wages for everyone.\"\n\nThe pandemic is also exposing the massive inefficiency and waste that takes place in a highly centralized industrial food system. Major cities in the U.S. have seen staggering queues in front of food banks, while at the same time, farmers are destroying excess produce, meat, and dairy in other parts of the country. The shock of the pandemic has suddenly made visible the massive inefficiency and waste that takes place in a highly centralized industrial food system. At the same time, some experts say that it is also showing what does work: local networks of farms that are biodiverse and don't run the risk of crashing all at once when something goes wrong.\n\n\"We're seeing horror stories of farmers throwing milk away and food being destroyed in fields,\" said Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas and author of \"Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System.\" \"But the reality is that these stories are all coming out of industrial supply chains. Farmers who are part of local networks are not throwing away food; in fact, they are rushing to keep up with demand.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Shift in Stances: A Look at Her Evolution in Key Policy Areas\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, who launched her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign on Tuesday, has taken significant policy shifts compared to her 2008 run, as she aims to appeal to the liberal base that has come to dominate the Democratic nomination process.\n\nIn 2008, Clinton was against same-sex marriage, a supporter of the Second Amendment, backed her Iraq War vote, and opposed states issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. In contrast, she now supports same-sex couples, advocates for tighter federal gun control measures, has admitted her Iraq War vote was a \"mistake,\" and is an advocate for illegal immigration.\n\nClinton's stance on free trade has also evolved, having been a supporter, opponent, and then a supporter again, and now opposes the Pacific trade deal she championed as the country's top diplomat. David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who advised President Obama's bids for the White House, commented on CNN, \"This is a classic political decision that you can flip-flop if you flop over to the popular side of an issue.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he will highlight these policy shifts and trade will be a key example. Sanders opposed trade deals with Mexico, Canada, Central America, and China.\n\nClinton has been more consistent, though late compared to other Democrats, in her shift on same-sex marriage. In the 2008 campaign, she openly opposed it, offering civil unions as an acceptable compromise of legal protection for same-sex couples. Only after leaving her position as secretary of state, and as the Supreme Court was considering overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, did Clinton change her stance.\n\nIn the 2008 campaign, Clinton was steadfast in defending her Iraq War vote, a vote that President Obama hammered her on and contrasted himself to. It wasn't until her 2014 book \"Hard Choices\" that Clinton says she \"got it wrong\" on Iraq. This year on the campaign trail, she's gone further, saying her vote was \"a mistake.\"\n\nOn guns, Clinton's moves have been more a matter of what she's emphasizing. In 2008, she criticized Obama's statement that rural Pennsylvanians \"cling to guns or religion\" and portrayed herself as an adherent of the gun culture. Last week, however, in the wake of another mass shooting, Clinton vowed to go further than Obama in taking executive action to limit gun ownership.\n\nOn immigration, Clinton is also revising her previous stance. In the 2008 debate, Clinton offered a confusing answer on whether she supported states issuing licenses to illegal immigrants. After the debate, and after then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer withdrew the proposal because of its unpopularity, Clinton made a statement that she would not support driver's licenses for undocumented people and would press for comprehensive immigration reform. However, as the power of Hispanic voters increases, Clinton has tailored her stance yet again, now supporting states granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, according to her campaign.",
    " Title: Progressive and Moderate Democrats Agree on More Than They Disagree, According to Dionne\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent analysis, Dionne, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and columnist for The Washington Post, suggests that the policy debates in American politics have shifted due to the radicalization of the Republican Party. The Republican Party, according to Dionne, opposes most government actions aimed at solving problems and focuses on cutting taxes for the wealthy and reducing corporate oversight.\n\nAs a result, the substantive part of many policy debates now takes place within the Democratic Party, leading to natural tensions between progressives and moderate Democrats. Dionne argues that both sides would be more effective if they were open to learning from each other, rather than engaging in \"an unseemly moralism that feeds political superiority complexes.\"\n\nProgressives argue that over the past half-century, Democratic moderates have allowed conservatives to dictate the terms of political conversation on various issues, including economic growth, criminal justice, family values, and more. Dionne adds that moderates have also focused on designing technocratically elegant policies, rather than creating easily understandable, popular programs.\n\nModerates, on the other hand, argue that every great progressive victory in American history, such as abolition, women's suffrage, the income tax, labor rights, Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, marriage equality, and more, has required compromise in the service of persuading allies who disagree with progressives on other issues.\n\nDionne emphasizes that it is not enough for one side to state their case purely and wait for a silent majority to emerge. In the long run, each side is likely to accomplish more if they recognize that the other isn't the enemy. However, in the short run, there is an inescapable dilemma: the party can nominate only one person.\n\nBefore the party's nomination, both sides should pause to reflect on the strengths of the other side, according to Dionne. For progressives, this means recognizing that moderate congressional candidates performed better in swing districts in 2018. It also means quietly celebrating the progressivism of candidates like Pete Buttigieg's agenda.",

Bush to Lie in State at U.S. Capitol, Buried in Texas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn accordance with presidential tradition, a detailed schedule for the funeral and memorial services of former President George H.W. Bush has been released. The ceremonies will take place in Houston, Washington D.C., Spring, Texas, and College Station, Texas. Bush passed away on Friday at the age of 94.\n\nIn honor of the 41st president, President Trump has declared Wednesday a national day of mourning, and has issued an executive order to close federal offices. Trump also announced that one of the Boeing 747s serving as Air Force One will be sent to Houston to transport Bush's casket to Washington D.C.\n\nOn Monday, members of both the House and Senate will attend an arrival ceremony at the U.S. Capitol at 4:45 p.m. ET. Bush will lie in state in the rotunda until Wednesday morning.\n\nFamily and friends will then gather at the National Cathedral in Washington for an 11 a.m. funeral service on Wednesday.\n\nBush will be taken to his home of Houston, where he will lie in repose at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston from 7:45 p.m. ET Wednesday until 7 a.m. ET Thursday. The church will also hold a second memorial service for the former president at 11 a.m. ET Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, a motorcade will take Bush's body to Union Pacific Railroad Westfield Auto Facility. From there, a funeral train will transport Bush to Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, the site of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where he will be laid to rest.\n\nBush will be buried next to his wife and former first lady Barbara Bush, who died in April, and his daughter Pauline Robinson \"Robin\" Bush, who died in 1953 at the age of 3.\n\nMore details about Bush's funeral arrangements are available on a tribute website for the former president. For those who wish to pay their respects, the Bush family has requested that donations be made to the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University to \"help ensure that President Bush's legacy of public service with integrity is perpetuated.\"",
    " Title: Wages Remain Stagnant for Workers Despite Auto Industry Recovery\n\nArticle:\n\nThe average hourly wage for workers in the United States has barely increased since President Barack Obama took office in 2008, despite the recovery of the General Motors (GM) and Chrysler industries and a decrease in unemployment rates. According to data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the average hourly wage has risen by just 42 cents over the past four years to $23.41, after adjusting for inflation.\n\nEconomists attribute this stagnation in wages to high unemployment levels, which allow companies to hire workers at lower wages. Sherry Cooper, chief economist and executive vice president at the BMO Financial Group, stated, \"It's unprecedented how modest the wage gains have been over this recovery. It's painful for consumers and detrimental for labor.\"\n\nThe issue of stagnant wages has not gone unnoticed, with Mitt Romney's campaign using the statistic to criticize Obama's statement last week that the \"private sector is doing fine.\" A campaign email sent out on Saturday read, \"Maybe he can ask families whose household income dropped $4,300 if they're 'doing fine.'\"\n\nThe problem is particularly pronounced in the auto industry, which Obama often cites as a success story on the campaign trail. Despite federal intervention and an increase in car sales, wages for workers building vehicles and parts have fallen. The average autoworker earned $21.65 an hour in April, a decrease of about $1.52 after adjusting for inflation, compared to the same point in 2008. This difference amounts to more than $3,000 over the course of a year.\n\nEconomists project that it will take years before many Americans receive raises, as unemployment remains high at 8.2 percent. Wages will start rising again when unemployment returns to what economists call its \"natural\" rate, between 5 percent and 6 percent, the point at which the economy is again running at full capacity.\n\nHowever, at this stage in the recovery, low salaries reinforce a cycle that makes the economy fragile. Without additional income, consumers are unable to spend or invest in ways that cause gross domestic product to increase by more than about 2.2 percent this year. George Mokrzan, director of economics at Ohio-based Huntington National Bank, stated, \"That's why we have modest forecasts, instead of strong forecasts.\"",
    " Title: Cruz's Third-Place Finish in South Carolina Challenges His Status as Conservative Frontrunner\n\nArticle:\n\nTed Cruz's third-place finish in South Carolina's primary has cast doubt on his status as the preferred candidate among conservative and evangelical voters. In a state where 73% of voters identified as evangelical in exit polls, Cruz, who has long positioned himself as the conservative choice, received 27% of the evangelical vote, trailing both Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.\n\nPenny Nance, the head of Concerned Women for America, expressed that Cruz's third-place finish in South Carolina makes it more difficult for him to argue that he is the front-runner or the unifying figure for the conservative base. \"It's going to be more difficult for him to make the argument that he's the front-runner, that he's the guy for everyone to coalesce around,\" she said.\n\nTimothy Head, the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a prominent Christian group, noted that the evangelical vote is not solely based on socially conservative issues. \"We're weeks away from seeing an actual coalescence around one candidate,\" he said.\n\nDespite Cruz's strong support from movement conservative leaders, such as Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, and James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, Cruz has yet to secure the evangelical vote in a significant manner. Cruz won the evangelical vote in Iowa and placed third in New Hampshire, but his performance in South Carolina indicates that his message may not be resonating with this demographic as effectively as previously thought.\n\nLooking ahead to the upcoming primaries in Nevada and Southern states, Cruz urged conservative and evangelical voters to rally to his campaign once again. \"If you are a conservative, this is where you belong, because only one strong conservative is in a position to win this race,\" he said. \"We are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nHowever, the South Carolina results suggest that Cruz's message is not fully translating even with conservative and evangelical primary voters who should be his natural constituency. \"Certainly the activist base, the tea party base, those folks really like Ted Cruz and support him, but for the evangelicals who maybe aren't living and breathing...Senate floor fights, people who are evangelicals, social conservatives, there is something about Marco Rubio they like,\" said Nance.\n\nAs March 1 approaches and a dozen states, many of them Southern, heavily evangelical, and similar to South Carolina, vote in primaries, Cruz's campaign has set high expectations for their performance. The Cruz campaign has been organizing in the South earlier and harder than any other campaign and has said they must, and will, have a strong showing.\n\nRubio and Trump also have paths in states politically similar to South Carolina, and Trump in particular comes in with a head of steam. The Cruz campaign acknowledges that the race is a three-person race headed into March 1, with some cross-over voting expected. As March 1 nears and the race grows more nationalized, the traditional views of the candidates\u2014Cruz as the conservative choice, Rubio as the more moderate one\u2014will come back into play.",

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that the choices made by the young can be \"the difference between life and death for someone else.\"\n\nAs of the time of this report, over 11,000 patients have died from the Covid-19 respiratory illness worldwide. The coronavirus outbreak was first recorded in China in December, but the center of the pandemic is now Europe.\n\nIn Italy, where the virus has claimed more lives than in any other country, the death toll rose by 627 on Friday, reaching a total of 4,032, marking the deadliest day for one country since the outbreak began.\n\nSeveral countries and regions have taken new measures in response to the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that cafes, pubs, and restaurants will be closed from Friday night. In the United States, borders with Mexico and Canada will be closed to most traffic, and non-essential businesses have been ordered to shut down in New York State and California. In Spain, the government warned that army patrols would detain people outside without good reason. Bavaria, Germany's second most populous state, has become the first state to impose a lockdown. In France, police have reinforced patrols at Paris railway stations to stop people from taking unnecessary trips. In Indonesia, a state of emergency will be in force in the capital Jakarta from Monday, with bars, cinemas, and many other businesses set to close down.\n\nSpeaking at an online news conference from WHO headquarters in Geneva, Mr. Tedros said, \"Although older people are hardest hit, younger people are not spared.\" He added, \"I have a message for young people: You are not invincible, this virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you. Even if you don't get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.\"\n\nMr. Tedros welcomed developments from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, which reported no new cases on Thursday. He said this provided \"hope for the rest of the world that even the most severe situation can be turned around.\"\n\nStudies have shown that people of all ages can be infected by the virus, but it is especially dangerous for older people and those with underlying illnesses. The average age of those who died from Covid-19 in Italy was 78.5 years. Fewer than 1% of patients under the age of 50 died in China, according to the New York Times. However, it was fatal for nearly 15% of those who were over the age of 80.\n\nThe WHO is now recommending \"physical distance\" instead of \"social distancing\" to help prevent transmission of the virus, according to Reuters. \"We want people to remain connected,\" said Dr. Maria Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, to the news agency. \"So find ways to do that, find ways through the internet and through different social media to remain connected because your mental health going through this (pandemic) is just as important as your physical health.\"",

By the end of 2013, more than 5 million people lost their insurance as a result of Obamacare making their plans illegal under the new law.\n\nHealthcare experts estimate that nearly 80-100 million private and employer-provided policies will eventually be cancelled as a result of Obamacare. Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute stated that, in addition to the individual cancellations, \"at least half the people on employer plans would by 2014 start losing plans as well.\" There are approximately 157 million employer health care policy holders.\n\nAvik Roy of the Manhattan Institute added, \"the administration estimated that approximately 78 million Americans with employer-sponsored insurance would lose their existing coverage due to the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nLast week, an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, showed the administration anticipates half to two-thirds of small businesses would have policies cancelled or be compelled to send workers onto the Obamacare exchanges. They predicted up to 100 million small and large business policies could be cancelled next year.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly before the Super Bowl, President Obama refused to admit that promising the American people they could keep their health plans under Obamacare was one of his biggest mistakes.

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), have introduced a resolution calling for the resignation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller from the Russia collusion probe. The resolution was introduced on Friday, citing Mueller's ties to the FBI and its role in controversies involving Russia.\n\nIn a statement, Rep. Gaetz stated, \"Evidence has emerged that the FBI withheld information from Congress and from the American people about Russian corruption of American uranium companies.\" Gaetz referred to Mueller's supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia's Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company, Uranium One, that controlled a significant portion of American uranium reserves.\n\nRep. Gaetz also pointed to a confidential U.S. witness, whose gag order was lifted by the Justice Department last week, and is now able to provide information to Congress. Gaetz alleged that the Obama administration and Mueller's FBI knowingly kept Congress in the dark about Russia's significant and illegal involvement with American uranium companies.\n\nRep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have also called for Mueller's resignation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley has called for an independent special counsel to investigate the Obama-era Uranium One deal.\n\nThere are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate with bipartisan sponsorship that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch's ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators.\n\nThe proposed resolution comes just days after Mueller's team announced the first charges in their investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts, and former Trump foreign policy campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos entered a guilty plea after admitting to making false statements to the FBI.",
    " Title: Graham Questions Rosenstein's Involvement in Mueller Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nTop Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has inquired whether Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should recuse himself from the Robert Mueller investigation, citing potential connections to the case. In a letter obtained by Fox News, Graham asked Rosenstein if he considers himself a \"potential witness\" in the Mueller probe in relation to the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nGraham's letter, dated May 31, refers to reports that Mueller's investigation is examining whether President Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, and the fact that Trump relied on a Rosenstein-authored memo to justify the dismissal.\n\nRosenstein's role in the matter was further detailed in a New York Times report earlier this week, which discussed a memo written by ousted FBI official Andrew McCabe. Fox News has confirmed that the memo describes a meeting where Rosenstein allegedly claimed Trump had asked him to reference Russia in his recommendation to fire Comey.\n\nHowever, Rosenstein reportedly declined and instead focused on Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe. President Trump, in a tweet, denied that he fired Comey due to Russia, stating, \"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!\"\n\nA source with knowledge of the investigation told Fox News that Trump had only wanted Rosenstein to mention that Comey was not under investigation in the Russia case. Trump himself, though, has cited the Russia probe in explaining his decision to fire Comey. Any indications that the president was motivated by the Russia investigation to act against Comey could fuel the obstruction of justice component of Mueller's probe.\n\nAsked for comment on Graham's letter, a Department of Justice official confirmed that it had been received. The new pressure on Rosenstein comes as President Trump continues to criticize Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his initial decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe, which led to Rosenstein appointing Mueller after Comey's dismissal. Trump earlier this week expressed a wish that he had chosen another nominee for attorney general.",
    " Title: Kentucky's Criminal Justice Reform Efforts: A Model for the Nation\n\nArticle:\n\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky has called for the nation to learn from his state's efforts to reform its criminal justice system, citing the need for a more effective and humane approach. The current state of affairs in the United States' criminal justice system is marked by high incarceration rates, a drug epidemic, and a significant financial burden on taxpayers.\n\nIn Kentucky, the governor has advocated for policies that promote redemption and human dignity, arguing that the traditional \"lock 'em up and throw away the key\" approach has been ineffective and counterproductive. The state has made strides in this area, passing expungement legislation in its latest session, which allows certain nonviolent offenders to wipe their slates clean after serving their sentences and completing a crime-free period.\n\nTo further address the issue, the administration has formed a 23-member Criminal Justice Policy Assessment Council. This task force, composed of a diverse group of voices, is conducting a comprehensive review of Kentucky's criminal justice system and recommending reforms aimed at making it more effective and less costly. The task force's recommendations will be presented as legislation before the 2017 session of the Kentucky General Assembly.\n\nGovernor Bevin has also joined forces with Governors Nathan Deal of Georgia and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, both of whom are spearheading criminal justice reforms in their respective states, in a film titled \"Changing Laws, Changing Lives.\" The film showcases their shared vision for a more humane criminal justice system and highlights the different approaches their states have taken to address the issue.\n\nThe governor emphasizes that the time for talking is over and that action is needed. By collaborating across state and party lines, the governors hope to develop plans that minimize the cost to taxpayers, maximize public safety, and motivate offenders to turn away from crime. The archaic \"tough on crime\" rhetoric of the 1980s is becoming a thing of the past, with Kentucky embracing a new style of justice that seeks to rehabilitate offenders rather than simply remove them from society. The governors hope that Congress will be inspired by their efforts and follow their lead in passing similar reforms at the federal level.",
    " Title: Fiscal Cliff Bill Averts Medicare Pay Cuts for Doctors, Eliminates Long-Term Care Program\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently passed bill, aimed at averting the nation from plunging over the fiscal cliff, included provisions that affected Medicare and other health care programs. One of the most notable changes was the prevention of a significant pay cut for doctors who treat Medicare patients.\n\nDavid Blumenthal, president of the American College of Physicians and an internist in Cleveland, stated, \"We know that this would really devastate access to seniors, to just cut payment rates by almost 27 percent.\"\n\nThe pay cut, if implemented, would likely drive doctors to stop accepting new Medicare patients and potentially drop existing ones. However, the language in the bill was not what doctors had hoped for, as it only delayed the payment adjustment, which has been a recurring issue since 2002.\n\nIn the meantime, hospitals are displeased because the so-called \"doc fix\" was partially funded by cutting $15 billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments to them over the next 10 years.\n\nDoctors are also concerned about potential cuts to the graduate medical education program when the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester return in eight weeks. This program, which helps fund the training of young doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals, is crucial for the medical workforce in the United States.\n\nAnother health care program, the CLASS Act, was eliminated as part of the fiscal cliff deal. Originally part of the 2010 health law, the CLASS Act aimed to provide publicly administered, long-term-care insurance at a modest cost. However, the program faced opposition from Republicans, who viewed it as a potentially unlimited government program that could not pay for itself.\n\nLarry Minnix, president of Leading Age, a group of more than 6,000 nonprofit providers of services to seniors and people with disabilities, stated, \"Long-term care, in the broadest sense of it, is responsible for people, including families, the 355 days [a year] they're not in the hospital and the 22 hours a day they're not in the doctor's office.\"\n\nMedicare has been a significant point of contention in recent budget battles and is expected to come up again in upcoming fights over the delayed budget cuts, raising the debt ceiling, and when last year's temporary spending bills expire, all before the end of March.\n\nHealth policy analyst Bob Laszewski stated, \"We're going to have three more cliff issues over the next three months.\" However, he added, \"We don't even have a Medicare entitlement fix on the table from either side.\"\n\nThis suggests that the 113th Congress is likely to face challenges in addressing these issues in the coming months.",
    " Title: Collapse of Building in Mexico City's Condesa District: Rescue Efforts Underway\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a building collapse in Mexico City's fashionable district of Condesa, a massive rescue operation is underway. The neighborhood, known for its vulnerability to earthquakes due to its construction on soft soil, has seen several buildings also collapse. Thousands of people are standing in the streets, avenues, and sidewalks, creating a sense of dread.\n\nOn Laredo Street, an eight-story apartment building has fallen into the road, leaving a massive pile of concrete and rubble. Over a hundred people are clearing the debris by hand, passing boulders and twisted steel pipes along a human chain. The sound of shouts and orders fill the air, with a call for silence to listen for any trapped individuals.\n\nSalom\u00f3n Chertorivski, the secretary of economic development for Mexico City, estimates that at least 10 people may be trapped inside the structure. The operation involves backhoes digging into the building's remains and helicopters overhead. A stretcher was passed up to the top of the heap.\n\nWorkers are frantically pulling people from the wreckage. A man is rushing down Amsterdam Street, searching for tools. \"Saws, hacksaws\u2014anything to cut wood and metal,\" he screams. Someone returns with a hacksaw and hands it to him, and he prepares to return to the mound.\n\nThe collective spirit of the community fills the disaster site, as neighbors and passersby join the rescue efforts. Moises Escobar, a 25-year-old recent college graduate, witnessed the collapse. \"It fell straight down,\" he said. \"There was a lot of smoke and dust.\"\n\nThe rescue operation continues, with the hope of finding and saving those trapped in the debris.",
    " Title: Grocery Workers in 20 States Receive Child Care Benefits Amidst Coronavirus Crisis; Calls for More Protections Grow\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on American lifestyles and shopping habits, Minnesota and Vermont have classified grocery clerks as emergency workers, making them eligible for free child care. Since then, more than a dozen states have offered free, subsidized, or income-dependent child care to grocery workers, bringing the total number of states providing this benefit to 20.\n\nAs they continue to face increased risk of infection, many grocery workers are advocating for additional protections. At least 41 grocery workers have died from the coronavirus, according to the Washington Post. The United Food and Commercial Workers union, along with major supermarket chains Kroger and Albertsons, have been urging federal and state officials to designate grocery workers as first responders, which would grant them priority access to masks and gloves. They are also calling for mandatory guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enforce sanitation, social distancing, and personal protective equipment in grocery stores.\n\nDavid Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, stated last week that the first-responder status was a step in the right direction but would not be sufficient to keep them safe. \"Essential workers need more than just masks and gloves,\" he said. \"They need a broad set of protections to enable them to safely go to work.\" Madland supports the Essential Workers Bill of Rights, proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Ca.), which would mandate protective equipment, sick leave, child care, health care, and a pay raise for essential employees like grocery workers.\n\nIn the absence of federal protections, workers' protections are determined by the companies they work for and state and local governments. Despite the growing recognition of grocery workers as heroes during the coronavirus crisis, only a handful of states have taken action to provide them with protections from the virus.\n\nSome states, including Delaware and Illinois, have issued guidance for grocery stores to limit the number of customers and enforce social distancing in lines. A growing number are requiring shoppers to wear masks. However, only a handful of states, including Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, are mandating that employers provide grocery workers with personal protective equipment.\n\nMassachusetts has made free, priority coronavirus testing available to grocery workers. California has expanded paid sick time to food sector workers and, along with Nevada and Maryland, has granted grocery workers the right to wash their hands every 30 minutes.",
    " Title: Pro-Life Organization Accuses YouTube and Pinterest of Discrimination Over Anti-Abortion Content\n\nArticle:\n\nOne of the nation's leading pro-life organizations, Live Action, has taken legal action against YouTube and Pinterest, alleging discrimination against the group's anti-abortion posts on both platforms. In a statement on Friday, Live Action announced that it had sent cease and desist letters to both companies on August 21, demanding they address the allegations or contact their lawyers by August 30.\n\nLive Action claims that YouTube has failed to publish its video ads, breached contracts, and caused financial losses. Pinterest banned Live Action from its platform in June, citing its \"pro-life educational and political content\" as \"pornographic.\" In their letter, Live Action's lawyers stated that Pinterest's decision was a result of \"kneejerk reactions and poorly thought-out pretexts for speech suppression.\"\n\nYouTube has acknowledged receiving the concerns raised by Live Action and is currently investigating the matter. Pinterest has yet to respond to the group's letter. \"Litigation is likely to ensue in this matter,\" the letters read.\n\nLila Rose, Live Action's founder and president, expressed her dismay in a statement, stating, \"It is truly sad and disheartening that in a society built on the principles of freedom of speech and assembly, companies like YouTube and Pinterest, who clearly benefit from these first principles of American culture, are engaging in not-so-subtle tactics to suppress speech with which they disagree.\"\n\nLive Action's attorney, Harmeet Dhillon of the Dhillon Law Group, stated, \"YouTube and Pinterest are clearly in violation of the law and must remedy this situation.\" Dhillon added that the evidence in both cases is substantial, ranging from suppression of speech and breach of contract to censorship and banning of Live Action based on false claims.\n\nLast week, Live Action made a similar accusation against Facebook, stating that the social-media platform's fact-checking mechanism labeled as \"false\" and \"inaccurate\" the group's claim that \"abortion is never medically necessary.\"\n\nRose warned, \"Continued efforts to censor Live Action will have tremendous implications, not only for the pro-life movement, but for free speech in America.\"",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee to Address Key Constitutional Issues in Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will hold confirmation hearings this week for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to serve as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, a 53-year-old federal judge, is a respected figure in conservative legal circles. However, there are still unanswered questions regarding his jurisprudence. Here are five matters that I would like to hear Kavanaugh address during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings:\n\n1. Marijuana Legalization and Federal Regulation: With marijuana legal in multiple states, but still federally banned, the Supreme Court has upheld the federal marijuana ban in Gonzales v. Raich (2005). Kavanaugh may be asked about the federal authority to regulate interstate commerce and whether it is broad enough to allow Congress to ban a local activity that is legal under state law and never crosses state lines.\n\n2. Presidential Executive Orders and Judicial Review: In February 2017, the Trump administration argued that President Trump's first executive order banning travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries was beyond the reach of judicial review. Kavanaugh may be asked about his agreement with this stance and the deference federal courts should show to the executive branch when the president claims to be acting in the name of national security.\n\n3. Unenumerated Rights: The Constitution refers to rights that it does not expressly list, such as the right to privacy, the right of parents to educate their children in private schools, and the right to gay marriage. Kavanaugh may be asked about the Supreme Court's justification for securing unenumerated rights from government infringement and whether the Court should overturn its applicable precedents and stop recognizing the unwritten right to privacy.\n\n4. Judicial Restraint and the Affordable Care Act: In his 2011 dissent in Seven-Sky v. Holder, Kavanaugh argued that the federal courts should have abstained from ruling on the constitutional merits of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Kavanaugh may be asked to explain his criteria for determining when the judiciary should \"afford great respect\" to lawmakers and avoid \"upending\" their \"legislative effort.\"\n\n5. Bulk Metadata Collection and the Fourth Amendment: In 2015, Kavanaugh wrote that the National Security Agency's bulk metadata collection program was \"entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\" Kavanaugh may be asked about his current views on the Fourth Amendment and whether he still believes the federal government's wholesale warrantless collection of every American's telephone record metadata is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe American people are eager to hear Kavanaugh's views on these crucial constitutional issues, and the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee should ask him about them during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week.",
    " Title: Pro-Choice Caucus of the House Announces Support for Bipartisan Medicare Deal Despite Abortion Funding Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic leaders of the House's pro-choice caucus announced on Tuesday their intention to support a bipartisan deal aimed at overhauling Medicare payments, despite the inclusion of a long-standing ban on using federal funds for abortion.\n\nReps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Louise Slaughter of New York made the statement in an attempt to salvage the Medicare deal, which was struck by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Speaker John A. Boehner, despite Senate Democrats expressing grievances about the so-called Hyde language on abortion and other aspects of the House package.\n\nThe pro-choice caucus chairs stated, \"The language included in the bipartisan compromise does not further restrict women's access to abortion, and the provisions expire along with funding\u2014just as the current Hyde Amendment does.\" They further encouraged other members of the pro-choice caucus to support this bipartisan compromise.\n\nThe abortion debate centers around a ban on the procedure within funding for community health centers. The abortion issue has already caused a stalemate in a Senate bill aimed at combating human trafficking, and lawmakers from both parties are concerned it will derail the hard-fought struggle to repeal an outdated Medicare formula known as the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR).\n\nCongress regularly overrides the cuts, but top Democrats and Republicans have stated it's time to scrap them permanently before April 1, when doctors face a 21 percent cut in reimbursements. Rep. Michael Burgess, Texas Republican and lead author of the SGR-repeal bill, said this week, \"If someone needs a reason to be against this, I\u2019m sure they can find reasons to be against it. I would rather approach it as, are there reasons to be for it? There\u2019s plenty of reasons to be for it.\"\n\nLeading women in the House are hoping their counterparts in both chambers see it the same way, even as they reiterated their distaste for the abortion-funding ban. \"The Hyde Amendment is a temporary rider that expires every year, and we\u2014along with many women across this country\u2014look forward to the day when it will end,\" Ms. DeGette and Ms. Slaughter said.",
    " Title: Trump Children Criticized for Business Ties Amidst Biden Scandal Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, children of President Donald Trump, have been criticized for their comments regarding Hunter Biden's business dealings, particularly in Ukraine and China, during their appearances on Fox News. The brothers' comments were seen as hypocritical, given their own extensive international business dealings, which have continued during their father's presidency.\n\nThe implication of the conspiracy theory pushed by the Trump brothers is that Hunter Biden's international business dealings created conflicts of interest for the Obama administration's foreign policy. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and the specific numbers cited by the Trump brothers regarding the amount of money Hunter Biden made in Ukraine and China are dubious.\n\nSince Trump's inauguration, Don Jr. and Eric have been responsible for the Trump Organization, which spans more than 30 countries, about 500 business entities, and generated about $9.5 billion in revenue before he took office. The brothers have sold more than $100 million of the family's real estate since the January 2017 inauguration, including a $3.2 million deal in the Dominican Republic last year that is considered a clear violation of their father's pledge to do no new foreign deals while in office.\n\nIn addition to Ukraine, the Trumps have also accused Hunter Biden of cashing in in China. However, a $1.7 billion Trump Organization project in Indonesia received a $500 million infusion from a state-owned Chinese construction company. Ivanka Trump, despite working in the White House, continues to do business in China, and her husband, White House official Jared Kushner, received a massive cash infusion from Qatar.\n\nThe news moves fast.

    " Title: Trump Seizes Tax-Cut Issue, Promises Simplification and Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken a leading role in advocating for tax cuts, aiming to stimulate economic growth and increase take-home pay for American workers. In a recent speech to the National Association of Manufacturers, Trump stated, \"The era of economic surrender is over.\"\n\nThe Trump tax plan includes reducing large and small business tax rates, doubling the standard deduction for middle-income individuals, simplifying the tax code by eliminating unnecessary deductions, repealing the death tax, and ending the alternative minimum tax.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the president's plan as a handout to the rich, but Trump has called for a bipartisan approach, citing the tax-cutting policies of past presidents such as John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. He has argued that his plan will make America's economy great again.\n\nThe Trump tax plan is currently being refined by key tax-writing committees to pass the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. However, there are some key points that require clarification.\n\nOne point of contention is the argument that the U.S. is doomed to 2% or less growth, known as \"secular stagnation,\" regardless of tax policy. The article notes that across-the-board tax cuts during the JFK period produced 5% annual growth, and after tax cuts were fully implemented in 1983, real growth averaged 4.6% for the remainder of Reagan's presidency.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have suggested that the 3% growth scenario will pay for the tax cuts, but naysayers refuse to admit that tax-rate incentives matter.\n\nThe article provides an example of the incentive effect of the Trump tax plan by comparing the current 35% corporate tax rate to the proposed 20% rate. For every extra dollar of profit, a company keeps 65 cents under the current rate, but under the proposed rate, a private company would keep 80 cents. This represents a significant 23% incentive reward.\n\nThe article also highlights the supply-side incentive effect of the Trump plan, including the repatriation of trillions of U.S. company dollars lodged overseas to avoid taxes, as well as 100% expensing write-offs for new investment of any kind.\n\nOn the individual side, the doubling of the standard deduction is a key aspect of the Trump plan. This change is expected to put more cash in workers' pockets, simplify the code, and mean that nearly 80% of taxpayers will not have any deductions.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the importance of the Republican party winning the tax-cut issue, preferably this year. The article warns that the GOP cannot let archaic process rules prevent good policy and encourages the party to play hardball, citing the bipartisan tax-cutting policies of past presidents such as JFK and Reagan.",
    " Title: Rand Paul's National Security Speech: A Mixed Message and Confusion on National Security Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a prominent figure in the libertarian movement, delivered his national security stump speech in New York on Friday, outlining his \"conservative realism\" platform. The speech, while containing positive elements, has been met with criticism for its omissions and perceived inconsistencies.\n\nThe speech, in part, marked a shift from Paul's isolationist stance, as he acknowledged the necessity of U.S. engagement in international affairs. However, the absence of key topics such as Israel, border security, immigration, and NSA privacy rights raised questions.\n\nOne area where Paul's speech was well-received was his praise for the U.S. military's success in Afghanistan post-9/11, and his criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the Libya intervention.\n\nHowever, the speech as a whole did not represent a significant departure from Paul's isolationist views or offer a coherent new plan for the right's approach to national security issues. The speech was criticized for its perceived confusion and disingenuousness, particularly in its handling of the global jihadist threat.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent jihadist attacks in Canada and New York, many expected a robust and forthright response to the threat that has defined the current age. Instead, Paul's speech offered a more nuanced perspective, stating that the world has a \"dignity problem\" rather than an \"Islam problem.\"\n\nThis focus on dignity issues was met with skepticism, as it seemed to downplay the role of extremist ideology in global terrorism. Paul's argument that U.S. support for unjust regimes contributes to jihadi terrorism was criticized for its potential to negate the responsibility of jihadists and for reinforcing the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy.\n\nCritics also pointed to Paul's history of conspiracy theories, such as his belief in Alex Jones' one-world government conspiracy theories, as evidence of his unsuitability for presidential material.\n\nSebastian Gorka, the Matthew C. Horner Distinguished Chair of Military Theory at the Marine Corps University and National Security Affairs Editor for Breitbart.com, was among the critics. Follow him on Twitter at @SebGorka.",
    " Title: Politico Corrects Article on Trump's Alleged Debt to Bank of China\n\nArticle:\n\nPolitico, an American political news and analysis website, has corrected an article published on April 24, 2020, that initially claimed President Donald Trump currently \"owes\" millions of dollars to the Bank of China. The publication was forced to edit the article after it was determined that Trump did not currently owe the Bank of China millions of dollars, as the Bank of China had sold the loan related to the property in question weeks after the 2012 loan.\n\nThe updated article now reads that Trump \"owed\" \u2013 past tense \u2013 money to the Bank of China. It includes an important note from the Bank of China as well.\n\nAccording to the updated article, the Bank of China participated in a commercial mortgage loan of $950 million to Vornado Realty Trust on November 7, 2012. However, within 22 days, the loan was securitized and sold into the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, a common practice in the industry. The Bank of China has not had any ownership interest in that loan since late November 2012.\n\nThe initial headline of the article, which suggested that Trump currently owed millions to the Bank of China, has been updated to reflect this new reporting. The changes were prominently flagged atop the article.\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, a Politico spokesperson defended the report, stating that the Trump Organization is a party to a loan that includes the Bank of China, based on multiple publicly available documents, including a 2017 filing with the city of New York that remains current through 2022. The spokesperson also noted that the Bank of China's NY-based PR representative called after the publication, stating that the Bank had sold that debt shortly after the 2012 deal.\n\nThe article still tries to connect Trump's response to the novel coronavirus, suggesting that the Trump campaign has increased its focus on portraying Joe Biden as weak on China amid rising voter disapproval of China, the source of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDespite the correction, the article has not been retracted. The spokesperson also noted that finance experts have told Politico that the documents provided to them were complex and didn't necessarily reveal who currently holds that debt, including the Bank of China. The 2017 filing with the city of New York still lists them as a creditor. Politico will continue to report on this story.",
    " Title: Essential Service Workers in Dallas County Continue Operations Amid Shelter-in-Place Order\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Dallas County enforces a shelter-in-place order, essential service workers such as plumbers, HVAC technicians, and electricians are continuing to enter the homes of residents, relying on customers to maintain safety protocols.\n\nKeresa Richardson, co-owner of Benjamin Franklin Plumbing in Dallas, stated, \"Plumbers, historically, protect the health of the nation, and we continue to do so by providing services when everyone else is quarantined. We're still out there doing our job.\"\n\nRichardson and her husband, J.R., run Lawton Group, a firm that includes Benjamin Franklin Plumbing, Buckaroo Pest Protection, Lawton Mechanical Services, and other companies providing mechanical services. They are requesting that customers inform them if anyone in the home is feeling ill or showing symptoms related to COVID-19 to ensure the safety of their employees.\n\nJimmy Dale, CEO of Baker Brothers, also emphasized the importance of customers notifying the company if they are sick to avoid potential coronavirus transmission. Dale stated, \"The fact that [workers] can spread it to other places and other people... that's the part that really scares them and scares us.\"\n\nBoth companies are taking precautions to minimize the risk of coronavirus transmission. Workers are maintaining six feet of distance from customers, wearing protective gear including face shields and gloves, and disinfecting equipment between every job. Employees at Dallas-Fort Worth-based Berkeys Air Conditioning, Plumbing & Electrical are also adhering to social distancing guidelines and performing touchless payment transactions.\n\nThe increased demand for plumbing services due to the shelter-in-place order has led to an uptick in service calls for clogged plumbing, likely due to residents flushing unsuitable items such as baby wipes, paper towels, and Kleenex.\n\n\"A lot of times we don't realize we have five people in the house, but you only have two people in at a time,\" Dale said. \"All day long, five people being there kind of creates that.\"\n\n\"We've had a big uptick in drain calls,\" Dale added. Baker Brothers saw twice as many service requests for clogged plumbing on a typical Monday compared to before the shelter-in-place order.\n\nPlumbing companies are also experiencing an increased demand for toilet paper, with some companies like Benjamin Franklin Plumbing even leaving a roll of complimentary toilet paper at the homes they service. Richardson explained, \"With a toilet paper shortage, they are flushing baby wipes, paper towels, Kleenex, whatever they can find to use if they've run out of toilet paper. That clogs the system because those are not meant to disintegrate like toilet paper.\"",
    " Title: Treasury Department Denies Delay in Stimulus Check Distribution Due to President Trump's Name Addition\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Washington Post published a story on Tuesday evening claiming that the stimulus checks going out to millions of Americans as a result of the coronavirus crisis are being held up due to the fact that President Donald Trump's name is being affixed to them. However, the Treasury Department has denied any delay and stated that the checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned.\n\nAccording to the article from Lisa Rein, the addition of Trump's name to the checks could potentially slow their delivery by a few days. The article also includes a section quoting some career officials claiming this will lead to a delay. The team, working from home, is now racing to implement a programming change that two senior IRS officials said will probably lead to a delay in issuing the first batch of paper checks, which are scheduled to be sent Thursday to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for printing and issuing. Computer code must be changed to include the president's name, and the system must be tested, these officials said.\n\nHowever, buried deeper within the piece is confirmation that the checks will not be delayed. A Treasury Department spokeswoman denied any delay and said the plan all along was to issue the checks next week. \"Economic Impact Payment checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned\u2014there is absolutely no delay whatsoever,\" the spokeswoman said in a written statement. She said this was a faster process than the stimulus checks the George W. Bush administration issued in 2008 to head off a looming recession. \"In fact, we expect the first checks to be in the mail early next week, which is well in advance of when the first checks went out in 2008 and well in advance of initial estimates,\" the statement said.\n\nMultiple Treasury Department officials confirmed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the claims of a delay are inaccurate. One Treasury Department official confirmed that President Trump's name will appear on the paper checks, adding there will be no delay to make that happen.\n\nMonica Crowley, the Treasury Department spokeswoman, also tweeted this response to the \"inaccurate and misleading\" Washington Post story on Wednesday:\n\nTreasury spokesperson response to last night's inaccurate and misleading Washington Post story: pic.twitter.com/5K7SNa6PFC\n\n\u2014 Monica Crowley (@TreasurySpox) April 15, 2020\n\nMost Americans are getting these cash payments directly deposited into their bank accounts, if they have gotten a tax return in recent years and the IRS has their direct deposit information on file. Some Americans, however, need a paper check to be mailed to them\u2014and the Treasury Department says these checks are going out ahead of schedule even with the addition of President Trump's name on them.\n\nDespite the claims from the Washington Post piece collapsing under scrutiny, many on the left and throughout the media and entertainment establishment have used this story to further attack President Trump. Tweets from legal scholar Laurence Tribe, former Obama administration official Chris Lu, and others can be seen above, accusing the president of delaying the checks for his own vanity and political advantage.\n\nA source familiar with the matter added to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the political attacks on the president and inaccurate claims of a delay in checks going out for this purpose are par for the course for those who hate President Trump. \"This is just another attempt by the entrenched, anti-Trump bureaucracy to craft a false narrative about the president's ego when in fact millions of Americans are already seeing their economic impact payments hit their bank accounts,\" the source said. \"The Washington Post is the propaganda arm of the out of touch, rabid, far left and should be lambasted for sowing discord as our nation attempts to navigate this challenging economic climate. Shameful.\"",
    " Title: GOP and White House Offer Differing Views on Fiscal Cliff Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a meeting with GOP leaders on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner presented a plan to avoid the fiscal cliff, which was described by a top Republican Hill aide as \"absurd.\" An aide to House Speaker John Boehner described the White House's offer as \"completely unrealistic\" and \"a break with reality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a top Democratic insider criticized the Republicans, stating, \"The Republicans have taken to screaming at us.\" A 30-minute phone call between Speaker Boehner and President Obama on Wednesday night was reported as \"unproductive\" and \"blunt.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner expressed his frustration at a press conference on Thursday, stating, \"No substantive progress has been made over the last two weeks. It's time for the president and Congressional Democrats to tell the American people what spending cuts they're really willing to make.\"\n\nWith the fiscal cliff deadline of December 31 fast approaching, President Obama is taking his case to the public. He is bypassing the ongoing negotiations between both sides and traveling to Hatfield, Pa., where he will tour a toy manufacturing facility and speak to workers. The White House stated that the President will be making the case for action by visiting a business that depends on middle-class consumers, which could be impacted if taxes go up at the end of the year.\n\nThe White House and the Speaker's office have provided differing perspectives on the fiscal cliff plan. Boehner's office outlined six reasons why the Obama administration's fiscal cliff offer won't fly:\n\n1. Twice the Taxes: The President's plan to raise the top two tax rates would yield about $800 billion in new tax revenue, but he has now asked for twice that amount.\n2. Not Even the Votes in His Own Party: The Senate barely passed a bill with $800 billion in new tax revenue a few months ago (51 votes). There is no chance there are votes in the Senate for anything close to $1.6 trillion.\n3. Unbalanced: The President's plan offers four times as much revenue as spending cuts.\n4. No Net Spending Cuts: The spending cuts offered in the plan are wiped out by all the new goodies the President is also requesting, such as stimulus, unemployment insurance, payroll, and housing programs.\n5. Debt Limit Pipe Dream: Permanently doing away with the debt limit is unrealistic. Raising it to infinity is not.\n6. We're Far From Opening Bids: Even as an \"opening bid,\" this offer would be ludicrous. The seven weeks to resolve the issue are almost gone, and this is what the President comes with?\n\nThe White House, on the other hand, maintains that the only thing preventing a deal that avoids the fiscal cliff and a tax hike on 98% of Americans is the refusal of Congressional Republicans to ask the wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates. The President has already signed into law over $1 trillion in spending cuts, and the White House remains willing to compromise. It's time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of voices supporting a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.",
    " Title: Federal Investigation Intensifies in Wake of Orlando Nightclub Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal authorities are intensifying their investigation into the Orlando nightclub shooting that left 49 people dead and 53 injured on Sunday. The probe aims to determine if Omar Mateen, the gunman, acted alone or if others were aware of his deadly plans and potentially aided him.\n\nFBI agents have interviewed Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, who could be charged as an accessory. Salman, who is reportedly cooperating, is under investigation for her knowledge of Mateen's deadly plans. The FBI has declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, but multiple reports indicate that the FBI visited Salman's childhood home in Rodeo, California, on Tuesday.\n\nInvestigators are also examining Mateen's radical Islam roots, with two trips to Saudi Arabia in 2011 and 2012 being a focus of interest. These trips were reportedly for the Muslim pilgrimage known as umrah, and experts question whether a working-class Muslim-American would make the pilgrimage twice in two years.\n\nThe FBI has taken a computer, camera, and other equipment from Mateen's Fort Pierce condominium, located approximately 120 miles from the shooting site. It remains unclear whether ISIS directed Mateen or merely inspired him, but Fox News reported on Tuesday that Mateen had a complex relationship with American suicide bomber Moner Abu-Salha, who detonated a bomb in Syria in 2014.\n\nAuthorities are also investigating Mateen's ties to Dwayne Robertson, a former New York gang leader who resurfaced in Orlando as an imam and is suspected of radicalizing Americans and sending them abroad to commit acts of terror. Robertson denies inciting violent jihad.\n\nFurther information from relatives and acquaintances is shedding light on Mateen's personality, revealing an angry and volatile individual with conflicting feelings towards the LGBT community. The massacre is being treated as both an act of terror and a hate crime against the LGBT community, yet Mateen's first wife reportedly believes he was a closeted gay man. Patrons at Pulse, the nightclub where he killed dozens, say he had been seen there frequently, and one reportedly said Mateen had contacted him using a dating app popular with the gay community.",
    " Title: President Obama Responds to Racial Controversy Involving LA Clippers Owner\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a familiar response to a racially charged event, President Barack Obama addressed comments allegedly made by Donald Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team. The comments, which were reportedly made to Sterling's girlfriend, were published by the gossip site TMZ over the weekend.\n\nDuring a press conference in Malaysia on Sunday, Obama responded to a question about the incident. He referred to the comments as \"ignorant\" and stated that they \"speak for themselves.\" The president also sought to place the incident in a larger context, noting that while the United States continues to grapple with a legacy of slavery and segregation, it is evolving in a positive direction.\n\nObama's response to the alleged Sterling comments is not the first time he has addressed a racially charged issue during his presidency. In July 2009, he stepped into the middle of the Gates controversy, responding to a reporter's question about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., an African-American professor at Harvard University. In 2012, the racially charged killing of Trayvon Martin also prompted comments from Obama.\n\nOn policy matters, Obama has been selective in his responses. After the US Supreme Court's recent ruling on affirmative action, in which the court upheld a Michigan referendum banning the practice in admissions to public universities, the White House press secretary issued a nuanced reaction, but Obama himself remained silent. However, the president has been vocal on voting rights, speaking out on voter ID laws and the invalidation of a key part of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nIn February, Obama unveiled \"My Brother's Keeper,\" an initiative aimed at helping young men of color avoid the \"school to prison pipeline.\" Some African-American scholars have criticized the initiative for not involving an infusion of federal resources.\n\nLester Spence, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is one such scholar. He describes Obama as having a \"voice in his head\" that tells him to avoid discussing race, and decries what he sees as a lack of boldness by Obama.\n\nAfter the alleged Sterling comments burst into the public arena, Spence wrote a blog post with several observations on the matter. Obama does not merit a mention in the post. Spence says he doesn't necessarily see Obama as having a role in the issue.\n\nDespite this, Obama was asked what he thought, and he responded. Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, describes Obama's response as a \"leadership moment.\" However, some critics question whether Obama's response was transformative or merely a response to a teachable moment.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Address Abortion, Gun Rights, and LGBTQ Discrimination in New Term\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming term of the Supreme Court is expected to be marked by significant decisions on contentious issues that divide American society. Among these issues are abortion, gun rights, gay rights, the separation of church and state, immigration, and presidential power.\n\nIn the abortion case, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in a case that seeks to essentially reverse a 2016 decision that struck down a Texas law making it difficult for abortion clinics to operate. The court's conservative majority, with the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy and the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is expected to either outright reverse Roe v. Wade or hollow it out.\n\nOn gun rights, the court is set to hear the first major test of gun regulations in over 10 years since the justices ruled that there is a constitutional right to own a gun for self-defense in one's home. Court observers attribute the hiatus on gun cases to a closely divided court on which neither the four conservatives nor the four liberals were sure how Justice Kennedy would cast his deciding vote.\n\nIn the area of gay rights, the court will hear a case that tests whether employers are free to fire employees because they are gay or transgender. A victory for the LGBTQ community would be significant, as discrimination against gay and trans individuals remains rampant, especially in the private sector.\n\nImmigration cases, particularly the Trump administration's attempt to roll back the Obama administration's program that protects \"Dreamers\" from deportation, are also on the court's docket.\n\nThe court is also set to address questions involving the separation of church and state, with religious rights advocates poised to challenge provisions in most state constitutions that bar direct or indirect aid to religious schools.\n\nIn addition, there are cases testing the power of Congress to get information from the executive branch, which is relevant to congressional oversight and potentially to impeachment. President Trump has expressed a desire to stop the ongoing impeachment inquiry, suggesting a possible legal challenge through the courts.\n\nFinally, the court is set to hear a case that could involve the 2020 election, testing the constitutionality of \"faithless elector\" laws, which impose penalties on Electoral College delegates who refuse to vote for the presidential candidate of their designated party. There have been 167 faithless electors in U.S. history, and in no case has the outcome of an election turned on their vote. However, there is no guarantee that this won't happen in 2020.",

In a statement on Monday, the company stated it is \"closely watching\" the growth of CBD. No decisions have been made at this time.\n\nCBD, which does not produce a high for the user, has been used for medical purposes, including easing inflammation, pain, and nausea. Coke's interest was first reported by Bloomberg, which said the company was in talks with Aurora Cannabis, a Canadian cannabis company. Aurora Cannabis has also expressed interest in cannabis drinks. Neither company would comment on a possible deal.\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ), the maker of Corona beer, Svedka vodka, and Casa Noble tequila, announced last month that it is investing an additional $4 billion in the Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth (CGC). A number of Canadian cannabis companies, including Cronos (CRON) and MedMen Enterprises (MMNFF), now trade on US stock exchanges, and some American companies have taken stakes.\n\nLagunitas, a craft beer label of brewing giant Heineken (HEINY), already has a drink infused with THC, marijuana's active ingredient, which does produce a high. It can be purchased at marijuana dispensaries in California.\n\nBoth cannabis and CBD are still illegal in the United States under federal law, even though a number of states have legalized marijuana. However, the prohibition against CBD is not strictly enforced. There are third-party sellers offering CBD-based products on Amazon (AMZN), for example.\n\nKris Krane, president of 4Front, a firm that advises companies on the legalities of marijuana and an expert on cannabis law, stated it is unlikely that a major company like Coca-Cola would offer a product infused with CBD in the United States until the federal law changes. He expects Coke would develop the product first for sale in Canada, readying it for the US market once it's legal.\n\nBonnie Herzog, analyst with Wells Fargo, stated in a note to clients Monday that Coke is positioning itself for the long-term. She said in a note to clients Monday that Coke is positioning itself for the long-term. She estimates that cannabis-infused drinks could become a $50 billion annual market in the United States -- nearly half the size of the $117 billion market for US beer sales.\n\nBoth Coke and rival Pepsico have been trying to expand their businesses beyond traditional soft drinks as people drink less soda due to health concerns. Just last week, Coke announced a deal to buy Costa Coffee for $5 billion. Canada is in the process of legalizing recreational use of marijuana. The drug is still illegal under US federal law, although some states have decriminalized it. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the epilepsy treatment Epidiolex, the first cannabis-based drug allowed in the United States. It includes CBD as well.",

The tweet, which was in response to the second night of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody, stated, \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\"\n\nTwitter's statement regarding the removal of the tweet read, \"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\"\n\nThe removal of the tweet sparked controversy, with some arguing that it was a clear example of Twitter's alleged bias and selective enforcement of its rules. The White House responded to the removal of the tweet, stating, \"The President did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.\"\n\nThe protests in Minneapolis have been ongoing since the death of George Floyd, who was arrested for a false document charge and died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly ten minutes. All four officers involved in the incident have been fired, and the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the incident for civil rights violations.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has been criticized for his handling of the situation, with President Trump tweeting, \"I can\u2019t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.\"\n\nThe removal of President Trump's tweet has added fuel to the ongoing debate about the role of social media companies in shaping public discourse and their responsibility to regulate content on their platforms. Twitter has been criticized for its alleged bias and selective enforcement of its rules, particularly in relation to conservative voices. The company has defended its actions, stating that it aims to promote healthy and respectful conversations on its platform.",
    " Title: Border Patrol Union Leader Criticizes National Guard Deployment as 'Colossal Waste of Resources'\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council's president, Brandon Judd, has criticized the deployment of National Guard troops to the Mexican border, stating it has been a \"colossal waste of resources.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, Judd, who leads a union with 15,000 members, initially supported the deployment but has since expressed dissatisfaction with its execution.\n\nJudd argued that the current deployment of troops to the border is not comparable to similar deployments under the Obama or Bush administrations. He stated, \"They were allowed to do a lot more than they are under the Trump administration.\" During previous administrations, troops were permitted to perform tasks such as manning lookout and observation posts, grading roads, and mending fences, which Judd claims freed up Border Patrol agents.\n\nHowever, Judd and union spokesman Chris Cabrera contend that the troops are now stationed far from the border and are working alongside agents, creating additional work and not freeing up agents for patrols as intended.\n\nA Pentagon official, who remained unnamed, told the LA Times that state governors determine the terms of National Guard troops' usage at the border. The official disagreed with Judd's characterization of the National Guard's usage, stating, \"It has not been a significant change under George Bush, Obama, and now Trump. They're different in how they're perceived. They're no different in what they're doing.\"\n\nActing Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost argued that the National Guard presence does free up some agents. Typically, pairs of agents operate aerostat blimps to monitor the border remotely, and now troops can replace one person on those teams, freeing up agents to be on the front line.\n\nHomeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman stated that the operation is not yet at full capacity, with more troops expected after a third request for assistance was recently approved. President Donald Trump's plan called for 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops from nearby states to support Border Patrol operations.",
    " Title: Rescue of Trapped Thai Soccer Team Continues Amidst Monsoon Season Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe rescue of four young soccer players and their coach from a flooded cave in Thailand's Chiang Rai province is ongoing, with the team still trapped more than 2 miles into the Earth. The rescue operation, which began on Sunday, has been met with global admiration and support.\n\nEight boys, ages 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach were found in the Tham Luang cave complex on June 23, but heavy rainfall and storms have complicated the rescue efforts. Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn announced that further rescues would be temporarily halted for 10-20 hours to allow the dive teams to rest and resupply the cave complex with oxygen and other necessary equipment.\n\nThe first of the four boys was extracted at 5:40 p.m. local time on Sunday, with the other three following over the next two hours. The boys, who cannot swim, were escorted through the cave by two divers each. The boys were placed in ambulances and given medical assessments before being transported to Chiang Rai Prachanukroh hospital, approximately 30 miles away.\n\nThe rescue operation is expected to continue through Monday, with the progress depending on weather conditions and the cave's internal conditions. The boys and their coach entered the cave complex on June 23 for a soccer practice and became trapped when heavy rains flooded some of the narrow tunnels.\n\nAn Australian doctor with cave diving experience examined the boys on Sunday and declared them fit for the operation. \"Today is D-Day,\" Narongsak said as the operation began. \"The boys are healthy, aware, and ready to come out.\"\n\nThe rescue effort has garnered international attention, with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk expressing admiration for the team's resilience on Twitter. British media have closely followed the events, and the story was the most-read on France's Le Monde and made the front page of China's state-run Xinhua news website.\n\nThe boys and their coach have remained calm and reassuring in handwritten notes to their families, with one boy, identified as Tun, writing, \"Mom and Dad, please don't worry, I am fine. I've told Yod to get ready to take me out for fried chicken. With love.\"\n\nResidents of the nearby town of Mae Sai, directly on the border with Myanmar about 7 miles away from the cave entrance, have followed the saga of the boys' disappearance and rescue efforts intently.",
    " Title: Empirical Analysis Reveals Media Bias: A Look at Recent Research on Media Bias in U.S. Media\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent podcast titled \"How Biased Is Your Media?\", the hosts delve into the debate surrounding media bias in the United States. The podcast, available for download on iTunes, via RSS feed, or through a live media player, features a variety of media practitioners and academic scholars discussing media bias.\n\nOne of the key studies mentioned in the podcast is a 2004 paper by Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo, which aimed to measure media bias. The paper served as the foundation for Groseclose's book \"Left Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.\"\n\nGroseclose's methodology involved analyzing the think tanks mentioned in media outlets' stories and comparing them to the think tanks referenced by elected officials when speaking on the House or Senate floor. The results showed that most media outlets have a liberal bias, with the Wall Street Journal being the most liberal, even surpassing the New York Times. Fox News was found to be one of the few outlets that lean right.\n\nThe following is a list of 20 major media outlets and their positions on the slant scale, with 100 representing the most liberal and zero the most conservative:\n\n1. ABC Good Morning America: 56.1\n2. ABC World News Tonight: 61.0\n3. CBS Early Show: 66.6\n4. CBS Evening News: 73.7\n5. CNN NewsNight with Aaron Brown: 56.0\n6. Drudge Report: 60.4\n7.

    " Title: Senate Confirms Tom Price as Health and Human Services Secretary in 2 a.m. Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services during a 2 a.m. vote on Friday. The vote was 52-47, with no Democratic senator supporting Price.\n\nPrice overcame an initial procedural hurdle on Wednesday evening along party lines. With the Republican Party holding a 52-seat majority in the Senate and only a simple majority required, Democrats do not have the manpower to block any nominees on their own.\n\nDemocrats signaled early on that Price would be a top target due to his support for dismantling the Affordable Care Act and overhauling Medicare. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) stated, \"Make no mistake: In the dark hours of the early morning, with the confirmation of Secretary Price, the Republicans launch the first assault in the war on seniors.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Price, who has previously backed privatizing Medicare, the \"exact opposite\" of what President Trump campaigned on. Democrats argue that Price's positions are out of line with Trump's campaign promises, which included not cutting entitlement programs.\n\nPrice, who was chairman of the House Budget Committee when nominated, stated late last year that Republicans would move to overhaul Medicare within six to eight months of Trump's inauguration. He also voiced support in 2015 for a proposal to reduce Medicare costs by delivering benefits through a voucher program.\n\nDemocrats are expected to use the vote on Price, and his position on Medicare, to target Sens. Dean Heller (Nev.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) \u2013 two Republicans up for reelection in 2018.\n\nPrice faced a rocky confirmation battle, also coming under fire for a growing number of reports about his stock trading as a member of Congress. CNN and Time reported last month that he had invested in health-related companies shortly before introducing or supporting legislation that benefited them. Price denied wrongdoing, adding that he made the investments through a broker.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2013 in her first floor speech since she was temporarily banned from speaking on Tuesday night \u2013 said Price should be disqualified for \"basic ethics.\" \"He should have withdrawn his nomination weeks ago, and if he didn't go voluntarily, the president and his friends in Congress should have quietly but forcefully pushed him out,\" she said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported last month that he received a 12 percent discount on his purchase of biomedical stock.\n\nRepublicans never publicly signaled that they were wavering on Price. They believe getting him confirmed is key to syncing up with the White House on the plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Trump and congressional Republicans, as well as House and Senate lawmakers, have at times struggled to get on the same page about a timeline for repealing ObamaCare or how to replace it.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Thursday that he hopes confirming Price will speed up the process. \"After seven years we've got all kinds of great ideas, but we have to come together behind one,\" he told reporters.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) praised Price separately as the \"right man\" for leading the department. \"Price knows more about health care policy than just about anyone. He doesn't just understand health care policy as a policy maker \u2026 he also understands it as a practicing physician,\" he said. \"He gets the real-world impact.\"",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Remain Silent as Sequester Deadline Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the budget deadline of Friday looms, Washington is witnessing a unique standoff between President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner. Unlike previous budget battles, there is no sense of urgency to resolve the issue.\n\nSince Thursday, Obama and Boehner have not communicated, and Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have not met since January 21. However, a meeting has been scheduled for Friday at the White House, involving Obama, Boehner, Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. This meeting coincides with the day the sequester is set to take effect.\n\nThe sequester, a series of across-the-board spending cuts, will indeed proceed as planned, despite previous statements from both Obama and Boehner. The cuts, which Obama had stated would not occur, and Boehner had promised his members would be avoided, will now take place.\n\nInstead of negotiating and inching closer together, the sides are moving further apart. Obama has called for slashing tax loopholes to offset the cuts, while Boehner has suggested closing loopholes as part of tax reform that would lower rates and create jobs.\n\nThe Senate is expected to pass a bill this week to increase taxes on high-income earners. If it passes the Senate and the 60-vote threshold, it is unlikely to pass the House. Boehner has stated that the House should not have to pass its sequester replacement bill again before the Senate \"gets off their ass\" and passes a bill.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in the fact that neither bill would pass the other chamber. Furthermore, the House will depart on Friday, the same day the cuts take effect.\n\nThe Republican party finds itself in a state of confusion, grappling with a mix of messaging about Obama crafting the sequester, the cuts being damaging but also deserving praise for finally reducing spending by at least 2 percent.\n\nBoehner and his team believe they are in a favorable position, with Obama advocating for tax increases to mitigate damaging cuts to the Pentagon, while Boehner stands for spending cuts.\n\nThis week, Boehner has expressed support for the most significant bipartisan endeavor: tax reform. He has even assigned the leadership's most prized bill title, H.R. 1, to rewriting the Tax Code.\n\n\"Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is continuing a thoughtful and thorough review of the Tax Code with an eye on tax reform,\" Boehner said at the CUNA convention, according to prepared remarks. \"It's time we shift the balance of power from the tax collector to the taxpayer.\"",
    " Title: Former North Charleston Officer Michael Slager Sentenced to 20 Years for Murder of Walter Scott\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a Charleston courtroom on Thursday, former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the 2015 murder of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge David Norton, classified the killing as second-degree murder and obstruction of justice.\n\nSlager, 36, was a patrolman in North Charleston when he pulled over Scott, a father of four, for a broken brake light on April 4, 2015. He pleaded guilty in May to violating Scott's civil rights by using excessive force, a charge that carried a possible lifetime prison sentence. Slager shot at Scott eight times, hitting him five times.\n\nState prosecutors dropped the murder charge in exchange for the federal plea. The case gained national attention due to a bystander's cellphone video of the shooting, which renewed concerns about police treatment of minorities. The footage was a central piece of evidence during the four-day sentencing hearing.\n\nJudge Norton rejected the defense's argument that Slager was provoked or acted in the heat of passion. Slager, dressed in an inmate's gray and white jumpsuit, expressed remorse during the hearing, stating, \"I wish I could go back and change events, but I can't and I am very sorry for that.\"\n\nScott's relatives and their lawyers hailed the sentence as a historic moment for justice. They called on law enforcement to reconsider the use of deadly force. Before court adjourned, several family members expressed forgiveness towards Slager, but their pain remains. Anthony Scott, Walter Scott's older brother, questioned, \"How could someone shoot someone in the back like that as they were running away?\"",

He had wound down the war in Iraq, overseen American efforts to help oust Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, and had approved the daring attack that killed terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nHowever, the diplomatic post attacks\u2014including another overnight in Yemen\u2014provide images, such as an American ambassador's body being dragged in the street, that could fuel comparisons.\n\nDavid Lane, founder of the California-based Pastors and Pews, said, \"America's 39th president was the last president who created such instability with the U.S. economy and foreign policy: the byproduct was turmoil in the world. Barack Obama, meet Jimmy Carter.\"\n\nDemocrats have rejected the comparison, and President Obama was critical of the way Mr. Romney has handled the situation, saying the Republican candidate has a tendency to \"shoot first and aim later.\"\n\n\"As president you can't do that,\" Mr. Obama told CBS News in an interview the White House read out to reporters traveling with the president on Wednesday.\n\nSome Republicans distanced themselves from Mr. Romney's remarks, which accused the administration of blaming Americans' exercise of free speech rather than the attackers. That criticism was based on a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt.\n\nHowever, other analysts defended Mr. Romney's handling of the situation.\n\n\"Romney's condemnation of the apology wasn't embarrassing or too early; it was correct, it was timely, and the only beef commentators have with it is that the White House didn't issue it first,\" said Danielle Pletka, American Enterprise Institute vice president for foreign- and defense-policy studies.\n\n\"The White House still doesn't get it,\" Ms. Pletka said. \"Look no farther than the difference between the Obama and [Secretary of State Hillary Rodham] Clinton statements\u2014Obama equivocates and Clinton condemns.\"\n\nShe noted that Mr. Obama said, \"While the United States rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others, we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants.\"",
    " Title: Kerry's Surprising Success as Secretary of State: A Year of Diplomatic Achievements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first year of John Kerry's tenure as Secretary of State, he has been widely regarded as having transcended expectations, making significant progress in restoring diplomacy as a central component of U.S. foreign policy. David Rothkopf, a prominent commentator, suggests that Kerry's legacy will be determined by the outcomes of ongoing negotiations in Iran, Syria, and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nKerry's success is particularly noteworthy given the challenges he faced at the beginning of 2013. As a familiar face in politics, Kerry was entering a role traditionally overshadowed by the President, and was tasked with addressing complex and often intractable international issues at a time when U.S. interest in overseas engagement was low.\n\nDespite these challenges, Kerry has been praised for his creativity, tenacity, and courage. He has won widespread acclaim for his efforts to restore diplomacy to the center of U.S. foreign policy, and for his willingness to take risks, such as his tireless travel schedule, mastery of facts, and forceful personality.\n\nKerry's impact has been felt in several key areas. In the Middle East, he has been credited with making significant strides in the Israel-Palestine peace process, and in Syria, where he brokered a chemical weapons deal. In Iran, Kerry has been instrumental in the ongoing nuclear negotiations.\n\nHowever, the success of Kerry's initiatives remains uncertain. The outcomes of the Iran deal, the Syria chemical weapons deal, and the Israel-Palestine peace process will determine the lasting impact of Kerry's tenure. The progress made in these areas will be crucial in determining Kerry's legacy and the Obama administration's foreign policy record.\n\nAs Rothkopf notes, the challenges ahead are significant. The success of the Iran deal, the pace of disarmament in Syria, and the prospects for peace between Israel and Palestine remain uncertain. The decay in Iraq and the future of Afghanistan, the spread of extremist groups, and the need for modernization of U.S. alliances are among the many challenges that Kerry and the Obama administration must address in the coming years.\n\nIn conclusion, while Kerry has had a remarkable year and has been an invaluable asset for the United States, his legacy and that of the President he serves will be determined by the opportunities he has helped create and the outcomes of the negotiations he has initiated. The coming years will be crucial in determining the success of Kerry's diplomatic efforts and the future of U.S. foreign policy.",

The administration's approach has given the impression of being in a state of disarray, as demonstrated by last night's coronavirus press conference.\n\nDuring the briefing, President Trump expressed surprise at the deadliness of the annual flu virus while emphasizing the importance of following public health officials' advice to treat the coronavirus like the flu. However, he downplayed the likelihood of a widespread U.S. outbreak, contradicting statements from public health officials, including the CDC, who have indicated a widespread outbreak is likely.\n\nA new U.S. case, potentially indicating a local transmission and a key indicator of a potential pandemic, was confirmed during the press conference. \"This is such a s--tshow. Thank goodness the markets are closed,\" a former Health and Human Services official who is close to the White House reportedly said during the briefing.\n\nSources familiar with the decision report that the appointment of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the administration's coronavirus response was made only yesterday. The decision had been a subject of discussion among staff, but it was unclear how many, if any, officials knew about the announcement beforehand. Several people were reportedly shocked, particularly given that Pence is heavily involved in Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nTrump's statements during the press conference were more upbeat compared to what public health officials have been saying, which some attribute to his concern for the stock market. Trump has also reportedly warned Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, as well as other officials, to avoid criticizing China's response to the virus. \"They have enough problems without you going out and saying they\u2019re not doing enough,\" Trump said to Azar, according to a source familiar with their conversation.\n\nOur thought bubble: Trump appears to want the panic over the virus to end as soon as possible to restore normalcy to the markets.",

A former senior NSA official confirmed to Fox News that the PRISM program, started in 2007 by the FBI and NSA, allows them to tap into top U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video, and other data.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement late Thursday, decrying the leak of the materials and stating that the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation's intelligence gathering activities. Clapper also took the rare step of moving to declassify information about the programs as he sought to defend them against criticism.\n\nClapper stated that the government is \"prohibited from indiscriminately sifting through the telephony metadata acquired under the program.\" He also noted that all information acquired is subject to strict, court-imposed restrictions on review and handling. The court only allows the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nA senior administration official also pushed back, stating that the Guardian and Washington Post articles about the Internet mining refer to collection under a law that \"does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.\" It was not immediately clear how the official defined \"targeting.\"\n\nThe PRISM program, according to the Washington Post, accounts for nearly one in seven intelligence reports. The companies that participate in the program, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple, reportedly only comply when legally bound to do so.\n\nAccording to slides from an internal presentation obtained by the Washington Post, there has been \"continued exponential growth in tasking to Facebook and Skype.\" The Washington Post report also states that with a few clicks and an affirmation that the subject is believed to be engaged in terrorism, espionage, or nuclear proliferation, an analyst obtains full access to Facebook's extensive search and surveillance capabilities. Skype and Google services can also be monitored for various activities.\n\nGoogle and Facebook have issued statements saying they only comply with data requests in accordance with the law. Both companies emphasize that they do not provide government organizations with direct access to their servers and only provide information when required by law. Microsoft also stated that it only provides customer data after receiving a legally binding order or subpoena.",
    " Title: U.S. and U.N. General Assembly Diverge in Voting Practices, Raising Concerns for Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Donald Trump prepares to address the United Nations General Assembly this week, a new State Department report reveals that the world body is out of alignment with U.S. interests in more than two-thirds of votes, potentially raising further concerns within the Trump administration regarding the organization and America's financial commitment to it.\n\nAccording to the report on voting practices at the U.N. in 2018, the U.S. and the U.N. General Assembly were in agreement only 31% of the time, a decrease from the final year of the Obama administration when they were in agreement 41% of the time. This means that the U.S. voted against 70% of assembly resolutions requiring a vote, more than any other U.N. member state.\n\nThe report, which is congressionally mandated, reviewed voting by the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council and 193 members of the General Assembly, and compared countries' voting records with the U.S. An additional section focused on how the world body votes on Israel.\n\nIn 2018, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley stated that the U.S. would be \"taking names\" of countries that vote against U.S. interests, particularly in regard to Israel. Trump also warned that the administration was watching votes, specifically from those that take U.S. money.\n\nThe 10 countries that are most out of sync with the U.S. (along with U.S. aid they received in fiscal 2018, according to the USAID website) are: Burundi ($69 million), Syria ($819 million), North Korea ($2.6 million), Turkmenistan ($4.5 million), Venezuela ($25 million), Nicaragua ($30 million), Niger ($573 million), Cuba ($12 million), and Iran (less than $1 million).\n\nAfghanistan, which received about $760 million, only voted with the U.S. 19% of the time. Pakistan, which gets $370 million, voted only 15% of the time with the U.S. Jordan, which gets $1.2 billion, was 21% in alignment with the U.S.\n\nHowever, the U.S. still enjoys support from some allies. The 10 friendliest records in descending order are: Israel, Micronesia, Canada, Australia, Marshall Islands, Great Britain, Hungary, France, Poland, and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 2018, Haley noted that the U.S. pays for more than a fifth of the U.N. budget, more than the next three highest donor nations combined. She stated at the issuing of the last report on 2017 voting records that \"this is not an acceptable return on our investment.\"\n\nAn analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations found that the U.S. government contributed more than $10 billion to the United Nations in 2017 - about $7 billion was voluntary and $3.5 billion was assessed.\n\nSince then, the U.S. has pulled out of a number of U.N. institutions, including the controversial Human Rights Council and the U.N. Social, Cultural and Economic body (UNESCO). It also yanked funding from the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency.\n\nThe report also found that the U.N. General Assembly is largely continuing in its anti-Israel slant, adopting 21 anti-Israel resolutions in 2018, the same amount as 2017. The U.S. supported these resolutions just 14% of the time.\n\nIt was perhaps with this in mind that new U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft gave a fiery speech at the U.N. Security Council last week, slamming anti-Israel bias at the body and reasserting U.S. commitment to its ally.\n\n\"It is inexcusable that pervasive, anti-Israel bias still exists in the United Nations, and that we continue to witness attempts by some UN Member States to undermine Israel\u2019s standing as a full member of the community of nations,\" she said. \"The United States vigorously opposes all such efforts.\"\n\nIsrael's Ambassador Danny Danon told Fox News that while anti-Israel bias remains, the \"needle is moving\" in the right direction and pointed to instances such as the U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Hamas last year. The resolution garnered a simple majority of support in the chamber but did not gain the two-thirds majority needed to pass.\n\n\"The resolution against Hamas, for example, is a notable success because, for the first time, a majority of member states supported condemning the group and labeling it a terrorist organization,\" he told Fox News. \"And there are many more successes that are taking place outside of GA and UNSC resolutions, but will begin to influence them in the years to come.\"\n\nTrump will address the General Assembly on Tuesday, when the issues of both Israel and value for money at the U.N. are likely to be addressed in his speech.",
    " Title: Leaks in Manchester Terror Attack Investigation and White House Leaks Compared\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council in Britain has condemned the unauthorized disclosure of potential evidence in the ongoing Manchester terror attack investigation, stating that it constitutes a breach of trust and undermines investigations, as well as the confidence of victims, witnesses, and their families. The disclosure has caused distress for families already suffering from their loss, according to Manchester's top police official, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins.\n\nEarlier reports suggested that the Manchester police had ceased sharing details of the investigation with American counterparts, but this was later clarified after Prime Minister Theresa May received assurances from President Donald Trump. The police have resumed intelligence sharing, though it is unclear if it had actually stopped initially.\n\nMark Rowley, an assistant commissioner in charge of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard and a member of the Police Chiefs' Council, emphasized that they are working closely with international law enforcement partners, including those in the 'Five Eyes' intelligence alliance, which includes the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.\n\nIn a separate matter, President Trump's handling of leaks has been inconsistent, with him capitalizing on disclosures during his presidential campaign but expressing frustration with information leaking from his own White House. Details of his conversations with Russian officials, as well as leaders of Mexico, Australia, and the Philippines, have been leaked to the public. Leaked information about a telephone call between Michael T. Flynn, his first national security adviser, and Russia's ambassador led to Flynn's dismissal.\n\nRecent leaks about President Trump's private conversations with and about James B. Comey, the FBI director he fired, have fueled investigations into his associates' ties with Russia. After The Times reported that Trump had asked Comey to halt an investigation into Michael Flynn, the Justice Department felt compelled to appoint a special counsel to take over the Russia investigation.\n\nThe article does not provide specific details about the nature of the leaked information in the Manchester terror attack investigation or the White House leaks, as it is unavailable. The article also does not express personal opinions or take a political stance on the matter.",
    " Title: Missouri Governor Plans to Sign Bill Banning Most Abortions After Eight Weeks\n\nArticle:\n\nMissouri's Republican Governor, Mike Parson, is expected to sign a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after the eighth week of pregnancy. The bill, which was approved by the Republican-controlled state legislature last week, would enact one of the United States' most restrictive abortion bans.\n\nGovernor Parson announced his intention to sign the bill to reporters on Friday, but has not yet set a date for the signing. He has until July 14 to sign the bill, according to local media reports.\n\nMissouri is one of eight states where Republican-controlled legislatures have passed new restrictions on abortion this year. This coordinated campaign is aimed at prompting the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court to cut back or overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nThe most restrictive of these bills was signed into law in Alabama last week, banning abortion at all times and in almost all cases, including when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, but allowing exceptions when the mother's life is in danger. The Missouri bill also offers no exception for cases of rape or incest.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has stated it will sue to block Alabama's law from taking effect. Last week, the ACLU joined Planned Parenthood, the women's reproductive healthcare provider, in suing Ohio over its recent six-week abortion ban. Mississippi will defend a new law banning abortion once a fetal heartbeat has been detected in a federal appeals court on Tuesday after the Center for Reproductive Rights sued to block it taking effect.\n\nAbortion is one of the most bitterly contested social issues in the United States. Opponents often cite religious belief in saying that fetuses deserve rights similar to those of infants. Abortion rights advocates say the bans deprive women of equal rights and endanger those who end up seeking riskier, illegal methods to end a pregnancy.\n\nKentucky, Georgia, Utah, Mississippi, and Arkansas have also passed new restrictions on abortion this year. Conservative lawmakers have been emboldened in their efforts to roll back Roe v. Wade by two judicial appointments by President Donald Trump that have given conservatives a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court on Monday took no action on appeals seeking to revive two abortion restrictions enacted in Indiana in 2016.",
    " Title: NATO Members Increase Defense Spending in Response to U.S. Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appeared on Fox Business Network's \"Mornings with Maria\" and discussed the increase in defense spending by NATO members in response to President Trump's insistence on fair burden-sharing. Stoltenberg confirmed that the target for defense spending is to be at 2% of GDP by 2024, with many allies already meeting or exceeding this goal.\n\nDuring the interview, Stoltenberg stated that President Trump and he have a close working relationship due to their shared concerns about terrorism and the importance of fair burden-sharing within the NATO alliance. He also acknowledged that European allies and Canada have increased their defense spending, making NATO stronger.\n\nIn July 2018, President Trump expressed frustration with what he perceived as disproportionate financial contributions from NATO members during a speech at the alliance. He stated that prior to his first meeting with NATO leaders, the amount of money being spent by countries was decreasing, but now, it is increasing substantially. Trump also tweeted that all NATO nations must meet their 2% commitment and that it should ultimately go up to 4%.\n\nAccording to a December 2019 article from Business Insider, NATO agreed in 2014 that each member state would increase their own defense spending to 2% of their respective GDP by 2024. Since 2014, several countries, including Estonia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Bulgaria, have reached or exceeded the goal. Other nations such as Turkey, France, and Norway are close to meeting the target. The United States still provides the most, with 3.42% of its GDP spent on defense, according to a NATO report.\n\nSpeaking before a joint session of Congress in April 2019, Stoltenberg stated that NATO allies must spend more on defense and that the increase in defense spending is making NATO stronger. He added that the additional funds would allow for investments in new capabilities, including advanced fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, missile defense, and surveillance drones. This, he said, is beneficial for Europe and America.",
    " Title: Virginia Delegate Proposes Bill Mandating Licensing for AR-15 Ownership\n\nArticle:\n\nDelegate Mark Levine (D) has introduced a bill in Virginia that would require all AR-15 owners to acquire a state license for ownership. Those who do not comply with this requirement and continue to possess AR-15s would be classified as felons.\n\nThe legislation, HB 961, applies to AR-15s and firearms that Democrats refer to as \"assault firearms.\" According to Levine, an \"assault firearm\" is defined as \"a semi-automatic center-fire rifle that expels single or multiple projectiles by action of an explosion of a combustible material with a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 10 rounds.\"\n\nThe bill also outlines certain cosmetic traits that classify a gun as an \"assault firearm.\" These traits include a folding or telescoping stock, a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the rifle, a thumbhole stock, a second handgrip or a protruding grip that can be held by the non-trigger hand, a bayonet mount, a grenade launcher, a flare launcher, a silencer, a flash suppressor, a muzzle brake, a muzzle compensator, a threaded barrel capable of accepting a silencer, flash suppressor, muzzle brake, or muzzle compensator, or any characteristic of like kind as enumerated in clauses (i) through (xii).\n\nIf Delegate Levine's bill passes the state legislature and is signed into law, current AR-15 owners, and owners of other so-called \"assault firearms,\" will have a grace period in which to acquire a license from the state. According to the bill's summary, \"any person who legally owns an assault firearm on July 1, 2020, may retain possession of such assault firearm after January 1, 2021, if such person has obtained a permit from the Department of State Police to possess an assault firearm in accordance with procedures established in the bill.\"",
    " Title: Gun Control Legislation Faces Challenges in Congress Despite Public Support\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing President Barack Obama's pledge to push for new gun control laws in the aftermath of the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre, there has been a significant decline in public support for stricter gun laws. According to various polls, support for stricter gun laws has dropped from 57 percent to 47 percent (CBS News), 52 percent to 43 percent (CNN), and 54 percent to 52 percent (ABC News/Washington Post).\n\nDespite the president's efforts, including rallies, using children as props, and holding events with parents of the Newtown victims, the proposed gun control measures, such as the assault weapons ban and limits on magazine size, have faced opposition in Congress. The current focus is on expanding background checks, although any bill that can pass both the Senate and the House will likely be less extensive than what the president or his supporters desire.\n\nThe decline in public support for gun control legislation and the challenges in Congress have raised questions about President Obama's legislative acumen and his ability to shape public opinion. Some argue that the president may have overestimated the support for his proposals and failed to consult with key legislators, such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, about the plausibility of his proposals. This is not the first time President Obama has faced criticism for his legislative strategy and his disconnect with Congress. In 2010, he held a ribbon-cutting ceremony with National Rifle Association (NRA) executive Wayne LaPierre at the Clark County Shooting Park in Las Vegas.\n\nIt is worth noting that 90 percent of Americans support universal background checks, a measure that even the NRA supports, albeit with a focus on improving state record-keeping. The ongoing debate highlights the complexities of gun control legislation and the challenges of balancing public safety with Second Amendment rights.",

The discussion covered a wide range of topics, including immigration, vaccinations, and foreign policy.\n\nCarly Fiorina made a strong impact in the first third of the debate, demonstrating her foreign policy knowledge and qualifications. She seamlessly integrated Iran and pro-life issues in one coherent response. Fiorina also displayed tact in her response to Donald Trump's \"look at that face\" comment from the previous week, stating, \"Women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\"\n\nOne of the most viral moments of the night occurred when Sen. Rand Paul called out Gov. Jeb Bush for his past marijuana use and his reluctance to support marijuana legalization. Bush admitted to smoking marijuana, and an argument over marijuana legalization ensued.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio had a decent performance, presenting coherent and logical arguments on immigration and immigration reform. Rubio emphasized the need for sensible immigration reform to fix the current system, which he described as \"no longer working.\" He also advocated for a merit-based system.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was more lively and focused than in the first debate. He defended President Bush's invasion of Afghanistan, citing his family's personal experience on September 11, 2001, and his work as a prosecutor.\n\nOne of the most perplexing moments of the night came when Dr. Ben Carson and Donald Trump discussed vaccines. When asked to tell Trump to stop stating that vaccines cause autism (they do not), Carson seemed to waffle and did not directly condemn Trump's comments.\n\nKatie, in her analysis, noted that Bush and Gov. Scott Walker did not have many memorable lines, but their tag-team exchange defending George W. Bush's policies was a highlight.",
    " Title: Emmy Awards Ratings Drop to Potential Lowest-Rated Telecast Ever Amid Political Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 69th annual Emmy Awards have reported a decline in ratings, with an 8.2 overnight rating among metered market households, a 2.4 percent drop from the 2016 edition. This could potentially make it the lowest-rated Emmy telecast ever, although the final rating is yet to be determined due to Hurricane Irma's impact on six of the 56 markets in Florida.\n\nMedia Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor described the Emmys as a \"Hollywood bubble show,\" stating, \"Actors and directors get to pretend they are important because they are doing such insightful takes on life in America, when they have zero idea what life in America is for the other 330 million people.\"\n\nThe Emmys were marked by political attacks on President Trump, with host Stephen Colbert's opening monologue through the end of the three-hour program. Alec Baldwin, who won an award for portraying Trump on \"Saturday Night Live,\" used his speech to mock the president for not winning an Emmy during his time hosting \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nFormer White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made an appearance to poke fun at his tenure, but this drew criticism from some viewers, who were upset that CBS allowed the award show to normalize a former member of the Trump administration.\n\nAcademy Awards prognosticator Steve Pond described the event as \"the most political Emmys show ever,\" and suggested that voters decided winners based on politics, opting for programs with a political agenda such as \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Atlanta\" over less-polarizing shows such as \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nGainor agreed, stating, \"The Emmys celebrate shows that almost no one either watches or cares about.\" He added, \"No ordinary Americans care about \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019 No ordinary Americans watch \u2018Veep.\u2019 The only show the Emmys were honoring that most people even recognize was \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019\"\n\nThe Emmys went head-to-head against NBC's \"Sunday Night Football,\" which may have contributed to the viewership decline. However, the awards have now hit new ratings lows for three straight years. Some viewers may prefer the awards show as an escape from politics, while others may not agree with the Hollywood elite's political views.\n\n\"Entertainment Tonight\" anchor Kevin Frazier stated on \"CBS This Morning\" that \"politics took center stage,\" with the \"recurring punchline\" being Donald Trump. The CBS morning show co-hosts seemed to approve, but the dismal rating has not been released yet.\n\nGainor questioned, \"Why would anyone who isn't a die-hard liberal watch?\" The Emmys are yet to officially be labeled the lowest-rated Emmys, but the ratings decline suggests a potential trend in viewer disinterest in politically charged award shows.",
    " Title: Senate Defeats Bill for Expanded Background Checks Despite Public Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, polls have shown overwhelming public support for expanding background checks on gun sales, with one poll indicating that 9 out of 10 Americans back the idea. However, a bill to implement such checks was defeated in the Senate on Wednesday. President Obama commented on the disconnect, stating, \"The American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen.\"\n\nThe primary explanation for this disconnect is the Senate's procedural rules, which enable a minority to block a majority. The legislation on background checks had the support of 54 out of 100 senators, but it takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThe Senate rulebook was not the only obstacle. There is often a chasm between what the public says it wants and what their legislators actually do. This disconnect is particularly pronounced in the case of gun control proposals, which score well in national opinion polls while facing strong resistance in the South and Mountain West. These regions include states with relatively small populations, which enjoy outsized influence in the Senate due to their equal representation.\n\nAnother factor is that issue polls typically include nonvoters as well as voters. However, elected officials focus on the people who actually show up to vote, and their sentiments might differ from those who stay home on Election Day.\n\nPoliticians also have to worry about the people who vote in primaries. They need to nurture their ideological bases, or else face defeat at the hands of primary opponents. This tendency has become more pronounced in recent years in the House of Representatives, where red districts have gotten redder and blue districts have gotten bluer.\n\nIntensity also plays a role, as a passionate minority can often outweigh a relatively indifferent majority. Gun control has typically exhibited this pattern: Second Amendment enthusiasts will always get in touch with their lawmakers and vote on the basis of this one issue, while supporters of more gun regulation may answer \"yes\" to a survey question and then forget about it.\n\nAdvocates hoped that the Newtown shootings would change the dynamic \u2013 not only by increasing support for gun control but also by making that support more fervent. However, any such effect was bound to fade, though not among those directly affected. In this case, timing worked against gun control, as the shootings occurred while Congress was focusing on the fiscal cliff, followed by the early months of the 113th Congress with a relatively light work schedule.\n\nPresidents have limited ability to drive public opinion and mass political action. Even at the peak of his popularity, President Reagan was able to motivate cards and letters when he was selling something that people already liked (e.g., tax cuts). When he tried to stir Americans on tougher issues (e.g., aid to Nicaraguan rebels), he got nowhere.\n\nToday, presidents work in a much more demanding media environment. Until the 1980s, they could \"roadblock\" the television networks with an Oval Office address. Now, they have to compete with hundreds of other channels and the Internet. Moreover, their critics and opponents have many more opportunities to respond in real time.\n\nJames Madison still rules America. The Framers designed a bicameral legislature and the separation of powers specifically to prevent an automatic translation of public opinion into public policy. Supporters of the system say that it fosters deliberation and ensures the protection of minority rights. Critics say that it prevents the passage of necessary legislation.\n\nAt the moment, political progressives are especially disappointed in the system. They should remember, however, that it has enabled them to block conservative ideas that were popular with the general public. If the polls always prevailed, after all, America would have a balanced-budget amendment and a constitutional ban on flag burning. President Obama has frequently taken credit for making tough decisions that were unpopular at the time, implicitly acknowledging that poll numbers do not always translate into righteousness.\n\nAmong other things, they need to learn from the other side. The National Rifle Association wins so many battles because of its zeal, its persistence, and its organization. Those who want tougher restrictions on firearms have to stoke the same kind of ardor, matching the NRA letter for letter, email for email, and phone call for phone call.\n\nGetting this level of commitment and organization may be difficult, except perhaps in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy. However, President Obama's political group, Organizing for America (OFA), might have the resources and savvy to succeed, helped along by the efforts of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The OFA insists that it is not a purely partisan organization and will pressure Democrats and Republicans alike. We'll see if it follows through.",

In a message to supporters, he expressed his commitment to defeating President Donald Trump and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\"While I will not be the nominee, I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life,\" Bloomberg stated. \"I\u2019ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday\u2019s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.\"\n\nBloomberg entered the race late and bypassed the first four nominating contests, investing over $500 million of his personal fortune in an advertising campaign, with nearly half of it targeted at Super Tuesday states. He won only one contest, in the U.S. territory American Samoa, earning four nominating delegates.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a surge on Tuesday, resulting in a series of victories that placed him at the forefront of the two-candidate race, as the more traditional liberal alternative to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Bloomberg acknowledged that his presence on the ballot may have dampened the Biden surge.\n\n\"Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump\u2014because it is clear that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult,\" he said.\n\nSimilar to other candidates who recently dropped out and endorsed Biden, Bloomberg believes the former vice president has the best chance of beating Trump.\n\n\"I\u2019ve known Joe for a very long time. I know his decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country\u2014including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve had the chance to work with Joe on those issues over the years, and Joe has fought for working people his whole life.\"\n\nWith Bloomberg's exit, only two major candidates remain in the race as also-rans behind Biden and Sanders: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have already endorsed Biden following their own withdrawals from the presidential race.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter to comment on Bloomberg's decision, stating, \"I could have told him long ago that he didn\u2019t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe\u2019s campaign, hoping to save face. It won\u2019t work!\" Trump also predicted that \"Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O\u2019Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Reiterates School Obligation to Enroll Undocumented Students, Citing Supreme Court Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder and Education Secretary Arne Duncan have issued new guidance to school administrators, emphasizing the obligation of public schools to enroll students regardless of their immigration status. The guidance, an update to earlier guidelines issued in 2011, aims to address reports of discrimination against children of undocumented parents.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Mr. Holder stated that schools must enroll students without discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. He emphasized that the Department of Justice will take action to ensure schools comply with this obligation.\n\nThe new guidelines state that schools have the right to establish a student's residency in a district, but they are not required to demand state-issued driver's licenses or Social Security cards to prove a student's legal status. Instead, parents can produce a utility bill or a lease as an alternative.\n\nThe guidance is based on the 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, which ruled that children of illegal immigrants have a right to a public education. The court struck down a Texas statute that denied funding for education to the children of illegal immigrants and a school district's attempt to charge undocumented persons an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each illegal immigrant student.\n\nSince the initial guidelines were issued in 2011, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights has received 17 complaints related to enrollment policies. Complaints were from Ohio, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., among others. In addition, there have been a number of undisclosed complaints filed in the Justice Department. In Georgia, the Justice Department evaluated the enrollment policies of over 200 school districts and helped them resolve issues, authorities said.\n\nSchool boards have historically taken action against illegal immigrants by requiring Social Security numbers or driver's licenses, and employing practices such as proposing separate schools for immigrant students and requiring paperwork designed to identify immigration status. Today, schools in states such as New York, New Jersey, and Arizona routinely inquire into immigration status as part of the enrollment process, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). In Alabama, public schools must determine the immigration status of children and parents during enrollment and can report the undocumented persons to immigration authorities.\n\nJoanne Lin, ACLU Legislative Counsel, stated in an email, \"Today's updated guidance reaffirms the longstanding principle, established by the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, that all children living in our country have a right to equal access to public education. School districts must adhere to this guidance, and meet their constitutional obligations to ensure that no child is locked outside the schoolhouse door.\"",
    " Title: U.S. and U.N. Pressure Syria Over Alleged Chemical Weapons Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nRebel forces in Syria have accused the regime of President Bashar Assad of using poison gas in an attack near Damascus, potentially killing hundreds of civilians. The Syrian regime has denied the allegations. The White House is attempting to confirm the reports independently but is urging the Syrian government to allow a United Nations (U.N.) chemical weapons inspection team to examine the sites.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council held an emergency session to call for a thorough, impartial, and prompt investigation into the chemical weapons use allegations against Syria. The U.N. ambassador of Argentina, the current council president, expressed strong concern about the latest chemical weapons use allegations and the need for clarity on the incident. Russia and China approved the move but blocked a stronger statement on the incident proposed by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe death toll from the attack varies, with rebel estimates ranging from the low hundreds to over 1,300. The exact death toll and nature of the attack remain unverified. The reports of chemical weapons use come almost a year after President Obama issued a \"red line\" to the Syrian regime, stating that the U.S. would ensure that Damascus would suffer \"enormous consequences\" if chemical weapons were used or prepared for deployment.\n\nWhen asked about the potential consequences and the limited U.S. response, White House spokesman Josh Earnest stated that the administration has not yet achieved its goal of removing Assad from power. General Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote a letter this week to a congressman stating that the Pentagon is opposed to even limited action in Syria backing the rebels because it is uncertain that such action would aid those who support American interests.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have called for some form of intervention to stop the ongoing Syrian civil war, which has been raging since 2011 and has resulted in over 100,000 deaths, according to U.N. estimates. Some lawmakers argue that the U.S. must act soon to salvage its credibility in the region and tip the balance of power against the Syrian regime.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has suggested that the attack may have been a \"provocation\" by the rebels. The U.N. chemical weapons investigation team, which arrived in Syria on Sunday, will now have to renegotiate access to the sites of this week's attack if they are to gain access to the locations. The investigation results will help determine whether the Syrian regime has crossed President Obama's \"red line\" once again.",
    " Title: Hospital Maintenance Workers Face Uncertainty and Risk in Fight Against COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nHospital maintenance workers and housekeepers, often unheralded yet vital to keeping hospitals running, are facing uncertainty and risk as they work on the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. These workers, who lack medical training, are struggling with inconsistent guidance from employers regarding personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nKatina McDavis, a 43-year-old housekeeper at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, spends 40 hours a week cleaning hospital rooms. She has spent more than 20 years on the job and has two colleagues who have tested positive for COVID-19. McDavis said that while her employer provides PPE, she often receives conflicting information about when and how to use it.\n\nAnne Igoe, vice president of a Chicago-based branch of the Service Employees International Union, which represents hospital workers, said that hospitals have protocols for keeping housekeepers safe but often fail to communicate them effectively. For example, rooms with COVID-19 patients have at times been mistakenly labeled otherwise, leading housekeepers to enter with insufficient PPE.\n\nNorthwestern Memorial said in a statement that it has enough PPE to keep workers safe and provides multiple channels for communication. However, a non-scientific poll by the Service Employees International Union showed that 75% of some 250 respondents, mostly housekeepers and nurse's assistants in Chicago and Indiana, have been told either they do not need PPE or must ask a nurse for it.\n\nKimberly Hughes, a housekeeper at a Montana hospital, has the chronic inflammatory lung disease COPD, leaving her at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. Hughes said she has been handed a 60-pound bag of laundry from a COVID-19 patient's room and told to hold it away from her body. Hughes, who stands 5'3\" and weighs 135 pounds, said she could not.\n\nFearful of contracting COVID-19, some hospital janitors are refusing to take on certain tasks. At Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, a janitor asked a patient to clean her own room, according to her sister. Nurses at New York-Presbyterian Hospital are at times taking out trash themselves to preserve PPE, one nurse said.\n\nTo cope with the increased patient loads and demands, a number of hospitals are seeking to hire more housekeepers. Retaining those they hire is another matter. Angel Medrano, a recruiter of hospital housekeeping staff in the San Francisco Bay Area, said a hospital he works with tripled the number of housekeeping staff it required in March. Most of the people his firm has hired are African Americans or Hispanics who have lost their jobs cleaning hotels and offices.\n\nHowever, around 20 people quit within the first couple of days on the job, mostly over concerns about PPE. The NYU Langone mechanic said he is so worried about getting infected that he is living apart from his wife and three-year-old son until the pandemic ends. His son recently woke up to a nightmare that his mother was taken away in an ambulance. \"I worry about how I would take care of my son if I got sick,\" the boy's mother said. \"I worry about how I will explain to him that his daddy probably won't be able to come for his birthday.\"",
    " Title: Understanding Trump Voters: A Look at the Rationality Behind Support for Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent commencement speech at Rutgers University, former President Barack Obama criticized anti-intellectualism in today's political debate, seemingly alluding to President Donald Trump and his supporters. Obama's speech highlighted the importance of facts, evidence, reason, and logic in policy-making, and expressed concern over the dismissal of experts as elitists when leaders express disdain for facts and repeat falsehoods.\n\nHowever, the rationale behind Trump supporters' choice may not be as straightforward as Obama's critique suggests. According to a report by The Christian Science Monitor's Patrik Jonsson, Trump followers feel that the candidate has tapped into something deep within them, transcending political reasoning. They see Trump as a leader who can make America great again.\n\nOne Trump voter in Georgia told Jonsson, \"We need a leader, not an ideologue.\" In this context, the coherence of Trump's debunked statements, such as his claim about seeing Muslims celebrating on New Jersey rooftops on 9/11, may seem less important to some voters.\n\nPolitical scientists Eric Oliver of the University of Chicago and Wendy Rahn of the University of Minnesota have found that mistrust of experts is one of the strongest predictors of a Trump voter. Trump supporters are farther over on the \"mistrust experts\" scale than all other Republicans, according to the researchers. This disbelief in traditional sources of authority is an inherent element of political populism, as they wrote in a March article for The Washington Post's Monkey Cage political blog.\n\nIn essence, Trump voters may view themselves as the rational ones in the national political discussion, as opposed to Obama Democrats. This perspective highlights the complexity and nuance behind the support for Trump, suggesting that the rationality behind their choice may not be as illogical as it might seem at first glance.",
    " Title: Ross Perot, Independent Presidential Candidate and Businessman, Dies at 89\n\nBillionaire businessman and independent presidential candidate Ross Perot has passed away at the age of 89, according to a statement from James Fuller, a representative for the Perot family. Perot, who ran for president in 1992 and 1996, died after a five-month battle with leukemia.\n\nIn business and life, Ross Perot was a man of integrity and action, according to Fuller's statement. He was described as a true American patriot, a man of rare vision, principle, and deep compassion, who touched the lives of countless people through his unwavering support of the military and veterans and through his charitable endeavors.\n\nPerot is survived by his wife, Margot, his five children, and 16 grandchildren. This 1992 file photo shows presidential hopeful H. Ross Perot at a rally in Austin, Texas.\n\nPerot was an early tech entrepreneur. He started his career in sales at IBM, where he excelled. In 1962, he founded his first company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), with just $1,000 in savings. More than two decades later, he launched information technology services provider Perot Systems, which was acquired in 2009 by Dell for $3.9 billion.\n\nAs a disruptive third-party candidate for president, Perot ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility and protectionism. He won nearly 19% of the vote in the 1992 race\u2014by far the biggest slice of the electorate for a third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party in the 1912 election.\n\nPerot stood out from the political crowd for his quirks as much as his business credentials and lack of experience in establishment politics. He was known for his statements such as, \"I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else.\" During the 1992 presidential debate, he famously said that the shifting of U.S. jobs to Mexico created a \"giant sucking sound.\"\n\nPerot participated in all three presidential debates in that election and took a nontraditional campaign route by booking lengthy time slots on network television to lay out his political views. Allan Lichtman, distinguished professor of history at American University, described Perot as \"certainly the most influential political force in the late 20th century from outside the regular party system.\" Lichtman told the Associated Press that he had been tapped to write a biography of Perot, but \"quirky Ross Perot, just like he pulled out of the presidential race, he pulled out of the biography.\"\n\nPerot was a veteran and followed his service with a lifetime commitment to supporting U.S. veterans, especially during the Vietnam War. He was honored in 2009 by then-Veterans Affairs Secretary James Peake for his advocacy efforts.",
    " Title: Democrats' Advantage in Midterm Elections Narrows Amidst Family Separation and Gun Control Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CBS poll published on Sunday indicates a narrowing advantage for the Democratic Party over the Republican Party in the upcoming November midterm elections. The poll shows 40 percent of respondents preferring a Democratic-controlled Congress, while 36 percent support Republican control. This is a significant shift from the Democrats' 10-point advantage in a June NBC poll.\n\nThe poll was conducted shortly after the peak of the family separation crisis at the Southern border, during which the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy resulted in the separation of families seeking illegal entry. Despite the significant public outcry against this policy, with 73 percent of Americans opposing the separation of children from parents as a form of deterrence, the Democrats' advantage has diminished.\n\nThe CBS poll, which surveyed 2,063 adults with a margin of error of 2.6 percent, also reveals a significant number of Trump supporters who opposed the zero-tolerance policy but did not hold the president responsible. The results suggest voters are compartmentalizing the issue, with many blaming the parents for bringing their children into the U.S. illegally.\n\nAnother factor affecting the Democrats' advantage is the gun control debate. According to a Washington Post poll in April, the gap between support for the two parties in House races has narrowed significantly since the gun control debate became a major issue following the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida in February. Nearly 40 percent of registered voters believe it is extremely important that political candidates share their views on gun control, and the poll suggests neither party holds an advantage in support among the 42 percent of likely voters who want congressional candidates to share their views on the issue.\n\nThe CBS poll also found that voters in key states for the Democrats in the midterms, such as Texas, Florida, and Arizona, believe Hispanic illegal and legal immigrants have had a negative effect on their lives. Nearly four in ten say immigrants from Mexico and South America have made life worse, compared to a lower 33 percent among voters across the country. Republicans are particularly likely to say immigrants have negatively impacted their state.",
    " Title: President Obama Faces Historical Barrier in Bid for Re-election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 U.S. presidential race, President Barack Obama is seeking to make history once again, as he aims to become the only president, besides Franklin D. Roosevelt, to be re-elected with unemployment rates as high as they currently are. The Democratic National Convention, held in Charlotte, North Carolina, serves as a platform for Obama to present his case for a second term.\n\nWhile the historical statistical models suggest a defeat for Obama in November, he enters the race with several key advantages. Incumbency, more room for error, and demographic advantages are some of the factors that give Obama an easier path to 270 Electoral College votes and victory compared to his Republican rival, Mitt Romney.\n\nIncumbency provides the president with an advantage, especially in a close, competitive race. Mitt Romney needs to win Florida and Ohio, and at least two of Virginia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, to have a realistic shot at 270. On the other hand, Obama enters his convention with several paths to cobble 270 together.\n\nDemographics also play a significant role in the race. As long as the GOP has a crisis with Latino voters, there is a built-in Democratic edge in several key states. New Mexico, not long ago a presidential swing state, is barely mentioned as a potential GOP target. Nevada is a competitive tossup despite the highest unemployment rate among the states and a punishing housing crisis.\n\nThe economy is the driving force behind the very different 2012 map and mood. The unemployment rate in February 2009, Obama's first full month in office, was 8.3%. Last month, it was 8.3%. To the Romney campaign, this is proof that Obama's economic policies have failed. The Obama team, in turn, notes that unemployment hit 10% in October 2009, and argues that the president's policies are, albeit slowly, helping pull the economy out of a deep recession he inherited.\n\nIn any event, the jobless numbers and other economic data make it all but impossible for the president to make the case that Americans are better off today than they were four years ago. The primary target for Obama is to make the case that his approach is the better, fairer path to sustained recovery. The primary target for his campaign is to appeal to independents and conservative Democrats in battleground states.\n\nThe convention also serves as an opportunity to re-energize Obama's 2008 base. The president's appeal to a Colorado college audience, \"Don't boo - vote,\" is a snapshot of the 2012 campaign's approach, understanding it cannot rely on the dynamics that motivated 2008 Obama voters.\n\nThe 2016 factor is also noteworthy in Charlotte, with Joe and Jill Biden having busy schedules, and the vice president having a coveted speaking slot. Biden is 69, meaning he would be 73 at the 2016 convention, but he has not ruled out a third try for his party's presidential nomination.\n\nHillary Clinton will have no Charlotte role, but the convention has no shortage of Clinton loyalists, including her husband, the former president. From there, the focus will be on ambitious next-generation prospects, among them Govs. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, and, for the first time in years, perhaps a Cuomo - New York's governor, Andrew.\n\nTo look at a map searching for Democrats of the future, though, is to be reminded of a painful truth for the party gathering in Charlotte: President Obama is their undisputed leader, but the Obama presidency has been a time of deep Democratic decline. The Democrats currently hold 51 Senate seats (plus two independents who align mostly with the Democrats), 190 seats in the House of Representatives (with three vacancies for seats last held by Democrats), and 20 of the 50 governorships.",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Files Defamation Lawsuit Against The New York Times Over Giffords Shooting Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nSarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, has filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging the newspaper falsely implicated her in the 2011 shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, according to documents filed in federal court on Tuesday.\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, states that an editorial published by The New York Times on June 14, 2017, falsely claimed that Palin played a role in inciting the shooting of Giffords by a mentally ill man. The editorial has since been updated, and a correction was added that reads: \"An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the newspaper \"published and promoted its Editorial Board\u2019s column despite knowing that the linchpin of its \u2018 sickening pattern\u2019 of politically-incited shootings was the false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited Jared Loughner\u2019s January 8, 2011, shooting rampage at a political event in Tucson, Arizona.\"\n\nThe lawsuit further states that the newspaper \"exceeded the bounds of legality, decency, and civility by publishing the false and defamatory column.\" Palin is seeking a minimum of $75,000 in damages.\n\nThe editorial in question claimed that there was a \"clear\" link between Loughner's attempted assassination of Giffords and a map Palin had created that placed crosshairs over districts that Republicans needed to flip in the 2012 election. However, no such link exists, as CNN's Jake Tapper pointed out in response to the NYT editorial, citing that Loughner's obsession began three years before the Palin map.\n\nAfter harsh criticism in the media, the NYT finally added a correction to its editorial. The lawsuit states that the newspaper's response to the backlash was insufficient, as it \"did not mention Mrs. Palin or acknowledge that Mrs. Palin did not incite a deranged man to commit murder.\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces Plans for Second Step Act, Focused on Criminal Justice Reform and Reducing Unemployment\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump held a celebratory event at the White House on Monday to highlight the bipartisan First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that Congress approved in December. The president announced plans for a \"Second Step Act,\" although he provided few details about what that might entail or when it might be introduced.\n\n\"Today I'm announcing that the Second Step Act will be focused on successful reentry and reducing unemployment for Americans with past criminal records, and that's what we're starting,\" the president said.\n\nThe First Step Act, which aims to give prisoners who exhibit good behavior the opportunity to shorten their sentences, particularly for nonviolent drug offenses, and to reduce recidivism, was praised from both the left and the right for its aims. The celebration of the bill comes amid a broader Prison Reform Summit.\n\nIn the East Room, the president championed the \"bipartisan\" nature of the bill and how it's helping people. Among those in the crowd was Attorney General William Barr, who expects to release the full Mueller report by mid-April.\n\nThe president welcomed on stage people who had been released earlier because of the First Step Act. One such man said there should be a second step.\n\nThe president claimed that since he signed the First Step Act, more than 16,000 inmates have enrolled in drug treatment programs. One beneficiary of the law said that for the law to be fully effective, it needs to be fully funded.\n\nHowever, the president's proposed budget requests only a sliver of the amount of funding laid out in the legislation. The legislation calls for $75 million a year over five years, but Mr. Trump's proposed budget only provides $14 million, as the Marshall Project first highlighted.\n\nTrump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner helped propel the legislation last year, along with nonprofit and other outside groups. Overcoming opposition from a handful of hard-right conservatives like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, the First Step Act was one of the few major legislative accomplishments his administration has achieved thus far.",
    " Title: New York Times Publishes Account of 2012 Benghazi Attack, Sparking Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Times has published an account of the 2012 Benghazi attack, a controversial event that has been a subject of debate and investigation for several years. The article, written by David Kirkpatrick, the Cairo bureau chief of The New York Times, provides a detailed narrative of the events leading up to and during the attack, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya.\n\nThe article sheds light on the aftermath of the attack, including the response of the U.S. government and the subsequent investigation. The article suggests that the White House and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was a key figure during the Obama administration, may have downplayed the role of Islamic terrorism in the attack, instead attributing it to a YouTube video that allegedly offended Muslims.\n\nThe article has sparked controversy, with some critics arguing that the account is biased and lacks credibility. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has praised the article for providing \"valuable insights,\" but has also noted that the account is \"heavily reliant\" on sources who may have had a vested interest in the story.\n\nThe Benghazi attack remains a contentious issue, with many questioning the response of the U.S. government and the actions of Secretary Clinton during the crisis. The article's publication has reignited the debate and may have implications for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.",

The deceased are Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, a recent college graduate, and Ricky John Best, 53, an army veteran and father-of-four. Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, is recovering from a knife wound to his neck.\n\nThe attack occurred on Friday when the three men intervened after a man launched into a verbal tirade against the teenagers, one of whom was wearing a hijab. The 35-year-old suspect is due in court on Tuesday, charged with two counts of aggravated murder, attempted murder, intimidation, and being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon. The suspect allegedly said \"all Muslims should die\" during the attack.\n\nThe FBI is still uncertain if the suspect, identified as Jeremy Joseph Christian, will face additional charges for a hate crime. Meanwhile, Micah David-Cole Fletcher continues to recover. His mother stated that his neck wound was \"a millimeter\" from his jugular vein. Fletcher posted a picture from his hospital bed, alongside a poem, on Saturday evening. One of the lines read: \"I spat in the eye of hate and lived.\"\n\nThe three men have been praised as \"heroes\" in their local community, with Destinee Mangum, the 16-year-old who was traveling with her friend, 17, expressing her gratitude. \"I just want to say thank you to the people who put their life on the line for me, because they didn't even know me and they lost their lives because of me and my friend and the way we look,\" she told local channel KPTV.\n\nA vigil was held for Namkai-Meche and Best on Saturday evening, attended by close to 1,000 people. Tributes have also been shared online, with the men being praised by Portland's mayor, Oregon governor Kate Brown, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who described their deaths as \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"No one should have to endure this racist abuse,\" Clinton wrote on Twitter. \"No one should have to give their life to stop it.\" U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to comment on the attack. A tweet by a reporter with the Oregonian newspaper, asking Trump for a comment, has been liked over 4,000 times. Veteran journalist Dan Rather wrote an open letter to Trump, which has been shared over 100,000 times on Facebook, urging the president to address the men's deaths.\n\n\"Two Americans have died, leaving family and friends behind,\" wrote Rather. \"They are mourned by millions more who are also deeply worried about what might come next. I hope you can find it worthy of your time to take notice.\"",
    " Title: Vice Presidential Debate: Pence Expected to Outperform Kaine in Tuesday's Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's vice presidential debate in Farmville, Virginia, between Indiana Governor Mike Pence and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine is anticipated to favor Pence, with Pence expected to dominate the debate while concerns about Hillary Clinton's health continue to surface due to her running mate's replacement.\n\nIn July, when Clinton and Donald Trump announced their respective running mates, the vice presidential debate was expected to overshadow the presidential bouts, given that Pence and Kaine have more impressive resumes in public life than their respective selectors. Both men have served as governors, with Pence building a solid reputation as a leader on Capitol Hill, while Kaine was one of the Democrats' more respected voices on foreign policy on the Sunday talk show circuit.\n\nHowever, since then, Pence has been a standout on the campaign trail, while Kaine has struggled to draw crowds, even in swing states where the contest is closest. Kaine's only notable contributions to his side's efforts have been his repeated accusations that Donald Trump is associated with the Ku Klux Klan and his defense of Clinton on her handling of classified information.\n\nIn contrast, Pence has been a net positive for the Trump campaign, reassuring the public that Trump will appoint competent people to high posts and be replaced by a capable leader, should the worst happen. By comparison, Kaine has been a net negative for the Clinton campaign. He seems to have been chosen for the sole reason that he would not overshadow Clinton on stage. In fact, when they appear together, she seems more likely to lose. It is difficult to imagine Kaine running the country.\n\nThe pattern is unlikely to change on Tuesday. Kaine will be sent on stage with a set of attack lines against Trump to reinforce Clinton's talking points from the last debate. Pence's job will be to look presidential, a task Kaine will make easier for him.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that vice presidential debates do not matter much. However, they can affect a campaign's momentum. In 2008, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin stunned a skeptical media, which expected her to fail, by outperforming then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE). The result was renewed zeal on the campaign trail for a ticket that appeared to be flagging since the first debate and the disastrous decision of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to suspend his campaign during the financial crisis.\n\nIn 2012, Biden put Barack Obama's re-election effort back on track after the president was beaten badly by Gov. Mitt Romney in the first debate. Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who had prepared well for a genteel battle of wits and policies, was stunned by Biden's antics and outbursts, which seemed clownish but successfully conveyed contempt for Ryan to a national audience.\n\nPence is expected to give the Trump campaign a boost and force the media to reconsider Clinton's health issues, which remain shrouded in mystery, as well as her judgment, which Trump has repeatedly called into question. This, in turn, will set Trump up for the remaining two debates and, perhaps, for one last, decisive, surge in the polls.",
    " Title: Study Finds Google News Results Skewed Toward Liberal Bias, According to AllSides Report\n\nArticle:\n\nA media technology group, AllSides, has released a report claiming that Google News' results are biased towards liberal news outlets. Over a two-week period, AllSides analyzed Google News' homepage and found that news outlets with a left-leaning bias were always at the top of the list.\n\nThe study determined that out of 123 individual measurements, 65% of the news links provided were liberal, while only 16% were conservative. This 4-to-1 ratio indicates a significant preference for news media sources from the left. The remaining 20% of the links were considered to be from a middle perspective.\n\nThe study highlighted the importance of the positioning of the news, with left-wing news tending to be in the top two results, and right-wing news always appearing below the fold, 12 positions down. AllSides wrote, \"The numbers are so significantly strong and consistent in favor of news media sources from the left that the overall conclusion of a leftward bias is well justified.\"\n\nThe study noted that sites like ABC, Buzzfeed, CBS, CNN, NBC, NPR, Politico, Time, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Huffington Post were heavily favored, while sites like Breitbart, The Blaze, The Daily Caller, Fox News, and the National Review were almost always below the fold. Even some of the news considered to be in the center wasn't necessarily neutral, as the study included NPR, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, and BBC.\n\nAccording to the report, 91% of the 123 measurements indicated at least some preference for news media with a left bias over sources with a right bias. It went even further, stating that 80% of the 123 measurements preferred left-wing news over news from a center source.\n\nAllSides CEO John Gable told USA Today, \"Right now, technology overly puts a spotlight on the most popular perspective, or the perspective that most fits you, and that cuts out other perspectives. It reduces an individual's ability to decide for themselves or know the whole story.\"\n\nGoogle told USA Today that \"search is not used to set a political agenda.\" The search engine company also denied any bias towards a political ideology.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders to Urge Unity, Highlight Clinton's Superiority in Key Issues at Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, will address the Democratic National Convention on Monday, urging supporters to consider Hillary Clinton as a superior alternative to the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. The convention, held in Philadelphia, aims to display unity in contrast with the Republican infighting that occurred during their convention in Cleveland last week.\n\nThe convention's start was marred by the resignation of Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Sunday, following the revelation of bias against Sanders during the primary contest with Clinton. The DNC emails showed staff members seeking to exploit Sanders' religious beliefs and Wasserman Schultz openly dismissing the notion that he could ever win.\n\nIn a statement before the news of Wasserman Schultz's resignation, Sanders' spokesman, Michael Briggs, stated that Sanders would make it clear that Clinton is superior to Trump on key issues such as economics, healthcare, education, and the environment. Sanders himself, in a muted response to the resignation, acknowledged that she had made the right decision but paid tribute to her \"years of service.\"\n\nSince a full-throated endorsement speech two weeks ago in New Hampshire, Sanders has swiftly backed Clinton, claiming to have moved the party's nominee to the left in a series of policy negotiations. In his Monday night speech, Sanders is expected to highlight agreements he reached with Clinton to expand healthcare access and to make public colleges tuition-free for students from families with annual incomes up to $125,000.\n\nSanders will also criticize Trump for aligning with the Koch brothers and echoing fossil fuel industry claims that climate change is a hoax, despite the scientific consensus that human-induced climate change is causing devastating harm.\n\nDespite some Sanders supporters' anger over the DNC email revelations, the Sanders campaign appears content with the outcome of a rules committee meeting on Saturday that proposed a commission to reduce the number of superdelegates in primary contests. Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, described this as a \"tremendous victory\" for Sanders' fight to democratize the Democratic party and reform the nominating process.\n\nSanders will use his speech to encourage supporters to continue pushing their agenda outside the mainstream. He will emphasize the ongoing political revolution to transform America and promote a government that represents all, not just the 1%.\n\n\"[He] will send a message to the convention and to the 13 million voters who supported him that they have begun a political revolution to transform America and that the revolution \u2013 Our Revolution \u2013 continues,\" said Briggs. \"Together,\" Sanders will say, \"we continue the fight to create a government which represents all of us, and not just the 1% \u2013 a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial, and environmental justice.\"",
    " Title: Delayed COVID-19 Testing in the U.S.: A Case Study of the Seattle Flu Study\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, home to some of the world's most innovative biotech companies and university research laboratories, was in a prime position to detect and monitor emerging cases of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus outbreak. However, a report by The New York Times reveals that officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hindered the development of diagnostic tests that could have provided an early warning and a head start on controlling the epidemic.\n\nSeattle infectious disease expert Dr. Helen Chu, by January, had collected a large number of nasal swabs from local residents experiencing symptoms as part of a research project on flu. Proposing to test these samples for coronavirus infections, Chu and her team were told by federal and state officials that they could not do so unless their laboratory test was approved by the FDA. The FDA refused to approve Chu's test, citing that her lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a process that could take months.\n\nIn the meantime, the CDC required that public health officials could only use the diagnostic test designed by the agency. The test, released on February 5, turned out to be flawed. The CDC's insistence on a top-down centralized testing regime greatly slowed down the process of disease detection as the infection rate was accelerating.\n\nFrustrated, Chu and her colleagues began testing on February 25 without government approval. They almost immediately detected a coronavirus infection in a local teenager with no recent travel history. Chu warned local public health officials of her lab's finding, and the teenager's school was closed as a precaution. The teen's diagnosis strongly suggested that the disease had been circulating throughout the western part of Washington for weeks.\n\nDid the FDA and CDC functionaries commend Chu for being proactive? Not at all. Washington state epidemiologist Scott Lindquist recalled, \"What they said on that phone call very clearly was cease and desist to Helen Chu. Stop testing.\" On February 29, the FDA finally agreed to allow biotech companies and academic labs in the U.S. to develop and deploy new tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe Seattle Flu Study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape\u2014sometimes designed to protect privacy and health\u2014have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster. Faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly. Due to red tape, the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. will be worse than it should have been.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Argues for DACA Program's Invalidity in New Court Filing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has connected the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, established during the Obama era, to the surge of children and families crossing the border, in new court documents filed on Friday. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that a weak stance on enforcing immigration laws sends the wrong message to potential migrants.\n\nIn a memo, Secretary Nielsen argued that the government must cancel the DACA program to project a clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of immigration laws. She stated, \"Considering the fact that tens of thousands of minor aliens have illegally crossed or been smuggled across our border in recent years and then have been released into the country owing to loopholes in our laws, it is critically important for DHS to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws against all classes and categories of aliens.\"\n\nThe document expands on the justification then-acting Secretary Elaine Duke gave last September when she announced a phaseout of the DACA program. Several federal judges have ruled her phaseout decision was not well-thought-out, and used circular logic that relied on the fear of a legal defeat in the courts to scrap the program.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who won one of those court injunctions halting the Trump phaseout, said the new filing was misguided. \"The Trump Administration doubling down on its decision to terminate the DACA program is based on its flawed conclusion that DACA is unlawful,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump administration, in the new memo, argues that the Obama administration stated the program could be revoked at any time when it started DACA in 2012, and was always meant to be temporary. Secretary Nielsen laid out both legal and policy arguments for why DACA is bad policy and bad legally.\n\nShe admitted the Dreamers who apply for DACA are \"sympathetic\" figures, but said that's not enough of a reason for the administration to exercise powers that rightly belong to Congress. The DACA program created a two-year renewable stay of deportation. Those who qualified were also given work permits, entitling them to driver's licenses and some taxpayer benefits.\n\nAs of several months ago, more than 800,000 people were approved for the program, and nearly 700,000 were still being protected under it. Secretary Nielsen said there's nothing wrong with granting special relief to Dreamers on a case-by-case basis, but she said DACA was a categorical program that saw applications of people who met the age and education requirements virtually rubber-stamped. She said those sorts of decisions on big programs like that should come from Congress, not the executive branch.\n\nWhile several judges have ruled the Trump phaseout illegal, Texas and several other states have filed a lawsuit arguing the original DACA program itself is illegal. Should Texas win that case, it could create a bizarre situation where DACA is illegal, but so is getting rid of it.",
    " Title: New York Governor Mario Cuomo's Third Term and Presidential Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Governor Mario Cuomo, once a formidable figure in the state, faced a decline in popularity that emboldened state legislators to challenge him. He attributed the erosion of support to the media's coverage of his response to speculation about a potential presidential run.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Cuomo stated, \"You've done everything but call me a liar. You said that I was cute. You said that I misplayed the game. You said that I was really waiting for another scenario. Well, the net result of that is it costs me credibility, because you spent all those months saying I was conning people.\"\n\nIn 1990, despite the economic recession and declining state revenues, Cuomo won a third term. His Republican opponent, Pierre A. Rinfret, a financial consultant and economics adviser to presidents, was not taken seriously even by his own party.\n\nCuomo's victory was convincing but unsatisfying, as he had performed better against his Democratic opponent four years prior.\n\nUpon returning to Albany to deliver his ninth State of the State address, Cuomo suggested diminished ambitions for his next term. \"This is a wonderful year for raw truth,\" he said. \"We don't have any money.\"\n\nHowever, Cuomo had one more presidential flirtation left in him. In October 1991, while on a trip to Chicago, he stated he was \"looking at\" a run. Many of his supporters grew weary of such talk, viewing it as a ruse to reinvigorate his sagging political image. In December of the same year, with presidential campaign plans on hold, he announced again that he would not be a candidate for president.\n\nYears later, Cuomo expressed regret that no one had taken him at his word when he stated he would run for president, had Republicans agreed to his request to pass a budget.",
    " Title: Economic Impact of COVID-19 Control Measures: A Balanced Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed concerns that the measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, business closures, and work-from-home orders, could have a more detrimental impact on the economy than the disease itself. Economists predict that the economic fallout from the pandemic could be as severe as or worse than the Great Recession of 2008-09, which cost the U.S. an estimated $22 trillion.\n\nWhen evaluating health or safety regulations, government agencies typically consider not only the number of lives saved but the cost of implementing such measures. This approach is justified because finite resources spent on one type of risk reduction might be better utilized elsewhere, potentially saving more lives.\n\nA rough calculation based on the \"value of a statistical life\" (VSL) used by the Environmental Protection Agency to assess proposed regulations suggests that the cost of COVID-19 deaths in the worst-case scenario, as sketched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), would be substantial: on the order of $13.6 trillion. However, if the economic projections are accurate, the cost of aggressive COVID-19 control measures will likely be higher.\n\nThis comparison assumes that government intervention will be completely successful in preventing those deaths, which is not true, and it uses a VSL that may be excessive in this case, as COVID-19 fatalities are concentrated among the elderly, meaning fewer years of life lost on average. Furthermore, there are valid reasons to believe that the worst-case scenario, which imagines 214 million infections (65% of the population) and 1.7 million deaths, is unrealistic.\n\nThe true case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19, although likely higher than the CFR for seasonal flu (about 0.1%), is likely to be much lower than the rates suggested by the official numbers, which include only confirmed cases. Since COVID-19 symptoms are typically mild to nonexistent, the actual number of infections is bound to be much higher.\n\nAssistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir states that the best estimates for the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 are somewhere between 0.1% and 1%. John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at Stanford University, calculates that \"reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%.\"\n\nThe CDC's projection implies a COVID-19 CFR of 0.8%, near the high end of these ranges. The scenario also assumes that voluntary measures to curtail the spread of COVID-19, such as avoiding crowds, limiting social interactions, and paying extra attention to hygiene, have no impact on transmission.\n\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty about these projections, and public officials may think they are erring on the side of caution. However, this is true only if one ignores the potentially devastating impact of disrupting economic transactions, shutting down businesses, and depriving millions of people of their livelihoods.\n\nIoannidis warns that if the CFR for COVID-19 is much lower than many people fear, \"locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational.\" David Katz, founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, advocates for a more targeted approach that focuses on protecting the people who face the greatest risk, stating he is \"deeply concerned that the social, economic, and public health consequences of this near total meltdown of normal life\u2026will be long-lasting and calamitous, possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself.\"\n\nIn formulating an appropriate response to COVID-19, there are no easy answers. Wise policy begins by recognizing the trade-offs that politicians have so far been inclined to ignore.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Deal on $2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus Package Nears as U.S. Congress Approaches Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nSenior Democrats and Republicans have reportedly reached a preliminary agreement on a $2 trillion economic stimulus package aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The deal, if finalized and passed, would mark the third and largest legislative response to the crisis.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed optimism, stating, \"At last, I believe, we're on the five-yard line.\" McConnell, the top Republican in Congress, added, \"We are very close.\" House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, also expressed optimism, stating, \"I think there is a real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours.\"\n\nThe agreement reportedly includes more oversight provisions for a $500 billion fund to aid hard-hit businesses, resolving a key sticking point. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed the changes, stating, \"There's better oversight.\"\n\nDemocrats had previously blocked the bill twice, citing insufficient funding for states and hospitals, inadequate aid for unemployed Americans, and a lack of oversight for a massive fund to aid big businesses.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in over 550 deaths and more than 43,800 cases in the United States. The crisis has led to the shuttering of thousands of businesses, the unemployment of millions, and the issuance of stay-at-home orders by state governors affecting about 100 million people, or nearly a third of the nation's population.\n\nIf a bipartisan deal is reached, Pelosi's $2.5 trillion counterproposal, which includes $4 billion for states to conduct the November presidential and congressional elections by mail, may become irrelevant.\n\nDetails of the emerging bipartisan bill are not yet available, but it is expected to provide financial aid for Americans out of work due to the virus and help for struggling industries such as airlines.\n\nThe Republican-majority Senate requires Democratic support to garner the 60 votes necessary to advance most legislation due to their slim 53-47 majority. However, the coronavirus has affected their ranks, giving Democrats additional leverage. Republican Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for coronavirus, and four other Republicans are unable to vote due to exposure to Paul or others with the virus.",
    " Title: Speaker John Boehner Announces Special Committee to Investigate Benghazi Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner announced the creation of a special committee to investigate the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. The decision was made on Friday, following a week of hints and a standoff between Congress and the White House.\n\nBoehner's announcement highlights his evolution as speaker, with the GOP majority now focusing on oversight rather than negotiating a budget-balancing fiscal deal with President Barack Obama. The move was prompted by a cache of emails obtained by the government watchdog group Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act, which House panels had been unable to receive despite issuing a subpoena.\n\nBoehner's decision to create the panel was a response to what he perceived as either the Obama administration's reluctance to cooperate with Congress or the House committees' inability to obtain the full documents. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the party's chief deputy whip, stated, \"The speaker was reluctant to do this, it's not something he was celebrating or anxious to do, even with earlier calls for it. But when the White House is releasing information in discovery in lawsuits that they are not releasing to Congress, that is a very serious breakdown that has to be dealt with.\"\n\nThe House will vote on a resolution to create the committee on Thursday. Boehner has been preparing for this move for some time, consulting with key figures involved in the Benghazi probes, including Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), who had previously proposed his own bill to create a special Benghazi panel. Boehner is expected to appoint Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) as the committee's chairman.\n\nThe creation of the select committee was a departure from Boehner's usual approach of allowing committees to handle their own work. However, the unavailability of crucial documents and the perceived lack of cooperation from the White House may have influenced his decision. The exact details of the committee's scope and focus are yet to be determined.",
    " Title: Opinion Piece by Paul Waldman Accuses Trump of Destroying America, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent opinion piece for The American Prospect, columnist Paul Waldman criticizes President Donald Trump and his impact on American politics and society. The article, titled \"The Impeachment of Donald Trump and the Contamination of Our Emotional Lives,\" expresses Waldman's view that Trump's presidency has caused widespread dread, despair, and disillusionment.\n\nWaldman argues that the impending impeachment of Trump could bring accountability, but acknowledges that the Senate is unlikely to remove him from office. He also criticizes Trump's tweets, his alleged racism, and his cruelty, citing these as examples of the \"unceasing parade of horrors emanating from the Oval Office.\"\n\nDavid Limbaugh, a writer, author, and attorney, offers a counterpoint to Waldman's piece, arguing that the columnist's assertions are biased and ignore the Democrats' pursuit of Trump since his candidacy and their handling of the Russia investigation. Limbaugh contends that the Democrats have wasted taxpayers' time and resources on a bogus case and have yet to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nLimbaugh also challenges Waldman's portrayal of Trump as a source of dread and despair, stating that the president's policies have stimulated robust economic growth and invigorated patriotic instincts. He further argues that the left's relentless criticism of Trump is exhausting and that they are projecting their own viciousness and intolerance onto the president and his supporters.\n\nThe article concludes with Limbaugh's praise for President Trump's efforts to stand against the extreme left's crusade to transform America and his gratitude for the president's commitment to upholding traditional American values. Limbaugh's piece serves as a response to Waldman's opinion piece, offering a contrasting perspective on the impact of Trump's presidency on American society.",
    " Title: Oregon Senate Republicans Absent to Prevent Cap-and-Trade Legislation, Democrats Accuse Them of Playing Hooky\n\nArticle:\n\nOregon Senate Republicans have left the state to avoid a legislative session that could result in the passage of a cap-and-trade legislation, according to Senate Republican Whip Dennis Linthicum. The legislators' absence is intended to run out the clock on the legislative session, as the state budget is already funded, Mr. Linthicum stated in a press release.\n\nAll 11 Senate Republicans have left Oregon, putting them beyond the jurisdiction of state police, according to Mr. Linthicum's spokesman, Jonathan Lockwood. Senator Herman Baertschiger, an Oregon Republican, stated that he would return if Democrats agreed to let the public decide by referring the cap-and-trade plan to the ballot.\n\nDemocrats have accused the Senate Republicans of playing hooky. The Oregon Democratic Party posted a \"wanted\" sign with the names and photos of the Republican legislators, labeling them as \"fugitives from justice (and their jobs)!\" The Democrats have also tweeted that the Senate Republicans' absence has serious consequences for the state's climate and that they should return to Salem and do their jobs.\n\nIf passed, H.B. 2020 would make Oregon the second state, after California, with a cap-and-trade program. The program aims to lower greenhouse-gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 to combat climate change. However, Republicans argue that the legislation would strangle economic growth and kill jobs, costing the average family of four at least $600 per year.\n\nOregon Senate President Peter Courtney stated that the Senate Republicans would be fined $500 per day for each day they are absent and a quorum cannot be reached. The Senate Democrats have 18 members, but need 20 members to establish a quorum.\n\nSenate Republicans have been active on social media, tweeting that Governor Kate Brown herself commended House Democrats when they staged a walk-out in 2001. Walkouts are rare but not unheard of, with similar incidents occurring in Wisconsin in 2011 and Texas in 2003. As a state legislator in 1839, Abraham Lincoln famously jumped out a window after the Illinois House Speaker locked the doors of the legislature.\n\nHundreds of protesters, led by loggers and a convoy of truckers, turned out Wednesday to protest in Salem, alarmed by the cap-and-trade legislation. Senator Baertschiger described the bill as \"a monster of a bill\" and stated that he would not be part of letting it pass.",
    " Title: Jared Kushner Loses Top-Level Security Clearance, Downgraded to Secret Level\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has lost the top-level security clearance he had been using on an interim basis to perform his duties within the White House, according to reports on Tuesday. Instead, Kushner will now use a lower level of access to classified information, similar to other White House staffers who had temporary clearances.\n\nPreviously, Kushner held a top-secret clearance with access to Special Compartmented Information, known as TS/SCI. Now, he and other officials will utilize a lower clearance level, a secret clearance, which restricts the amount of material they can access. The news was first reported by Politico.\n\nOn Tuesday, another story raised new questions about Kushner's future within the White House. The Washington Post reported that foreign officials have discussed potential methods to manipulate Kushner by exploiting his finances, business dealings, or his lack of experience in foreign policy and government.\n\nFor now, Kushner is expected to continue working in his unpaid role as a senior adviser to Trump, despite losing this round in a dispute with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. The two men have reportedly been at odds over access to the president and the nature of their jobs. Trump stated last week that he trusted Kelly to resolve the dispute.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly stated earlier that he would not comment on any one person's security clearance. However, Kelly did issue a statement regarding Kushner's role within the White House:\n\n\"As I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"Everyone in the White House is grateful for these valuable contributions to furthering the president's agenda. There is no truth to any suggestion otherwise,\" Kelly also said.\n\nKelly had set Friday as the deadline to discontinue any top-secret or higher-level interim clearances for individuals whose background investigations had been pending since June 1, 2017, or before.\n\nKushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, stated that there is a backlog in the process for securing a permanent clearance. \"Mr. Kushner has done more than what is expected of him in this process,\" Lowell said in a statement provided to NPR.\n\n\"Those involved in the process again have confirmed that there are dozens of people at Mr. Kushner's level whose process is delayed. It is not uncommon for these clearance reviews to take this long in a new administration, and the current backlogs are now being addressed. No concerns were raised about Mr. Kushner's application. As General Kelly himself said, the new clearance policy will not affect Mr. Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president,\" Lowell continued.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) stated that the change in Kushner's access to sensitive information should have occurred months ago. \"Downgrading Jared Kushner's security clearance gives new meaning to the term 'overdue,'\" Blumenthal said. \"Kushner's access to highly sensitive, classified information should have been not just downgraded, but eliminated long ago. There is no reasonable justification for a yearlong policy that allowed people who may have very harmful secrets in their own backgrounds to have access to our nation's secrets.\"\n\nThe resignation of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter had revealed that a number of people on staff had never received full, permanent clearances, meaning they were accessing national security and other secret information even after questions had been raised during background checks about their ability to qualify to do so.\n\nThe Porter scandal embarrassed Kelly and the White House after Trump and Republicans had made the handling of secrets such a focus of their 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton, who operated a private email server while she served as secretary of state. Clinton was repeatedly faulted during the campaign about what critics called her slipshod approach to handling sensitive information.",
    " Title: Arkansas Senate Overrides Veto, Advances Abortion Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Arkansas Senate, in a party-line vote, overrode Democratic Governor Mike Beebe's veto of a bill that imposes near-total abortion bans starting from the 20th week of pregnancy. The Senate also advanced a separate bill that would outlaw most abortions from the 12th week, sending it to Governor Beebe for his consideration.\n\nThe 20-week bill, which took effect immediately, is based on the contested claim that fetuses can feel pain by the 20th week. Senate President Michael Lamoureux, a Republican from Russellville, supported the override but expressed doubts about the bill's constitutionality.\n\nMinutes after overriding Governor Beebe's veto, the Senate voted 26-8 in favor of the 12-week bill, which would outlaw most abortions starting from the 12th week of pregnancy. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas has already announced its intention to challenge either the 20-week or 12-week bills if they become law, and opponents of the legislation are expected to seek an injunction barring enforcement of the new restrictions pending the outcome of the expected legal challenge.\n\nGovernor Beebe has stated that he believes the new law contradicts the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion until a fetus can viably survive outside of the womb, typically at 22 to 24 weeks. He also expressed concerns about the state wasting money trying to defend the law.\n\nSen. Bruce Maloch, a Democrat from Magnolia, previously voted for the 20-week ban but voted against the override out of deference to Governor Beebe and the concerns he raised over the measure's constitutionality.\n\nThe near-ban of abortions starting from the 20th week of pregnancy is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by then. Seven states have enacted similar 20-week restrictions based on the fetal pain argument, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks laws affecting women's health. A similar law in Arizona has been blocked while a federal appeals court reviews a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe 12-week bill is based on the argument that a fetus should be protected from abortion once its heartbeat can be detected during an abdominal ultrasound. The governor has not stated whether he will veto the bill, but he has expressed constitutional concerns with the measure.\n\nSen. Jason Rapert, the Republican sponsor of the 12-week ban, stated that Governor Beebe should let the measure go into law without his signature. \"I respect his opinions and what he has to do as an individual, but I believe he should honor the vote of the Legislature,\" Rapert told reporters after the vote.",
    " Title: Trump's Ongoing Response to Ongoing Probes and the Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has, for months, expressed discontent towards the ongoing investigations, often unprompted, asserting, \"I'm not under investigation.\" He closely monitors television coverage of the investigations, sometimes recording morning news shows to review them in the evening.\n\nTrump's recent focus on the idea that the investigation has run its course is evident. In a tweet on June 16, 2017, he stated, \"after 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my 'collusion with the Russians,' nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!\"\n\nThe source of the \"7 months\" is unclear, but Trump's point is that the investigation has prolonged long enough. Comparing it to the Whitewater investigation, which lasted over four years before evidence of wrongdoing was found, Trump aims to terminate the investigation before Special Counsel Robert Mueller delves too deeply into his financial affairs and before the investigation recruits a significant number of accountants and lawyers to scrutinize his financial records.\n\nTrump has also described the investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and claimed that others are out to get him. An adviser who has spoken with Trump and his top aides stated, \"It's basically all he talks about on the phone.\"\n\nTrump's surrogates have also been pushing the notion that Mueller is biased, as he has hired individuals who contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign, and that the investigation is a sham. It is unclear when Trump may declare the investigation over, but he has been reported to be considering devoting half the FBI's resources to monitoring the other half for potential leaks.\n\nDespite concerns about the political implications, Trump's actions suggest that he is not weighing the consequences or looking down the road. He wants Mueller removed from the investigation, and there is only so long his staff will hold him back.",
    " Title: Eric Cantor Loses Primary Election in Virginia's 7th Congressional District\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Representative Eric Cantor (R-VA), the sitting Majority Leader of the House, has lost his primary election to Professor Dave Brat (R-VA) in Virginia's 7th Congressional District. The election result was described by elections expert Sean Trende as the \"biggest House upset\" he has ever seen.\n\nDespite a significant spending advantage in the last seven weeks, with Cantor outspending Brat by $993,000 to $76,000, Cantor was unable to secure a victory in a race that was widely expected to be a comfortable win. A recent poll had shown a potential tightening of the race, but Cantor still led by double digits.\n\nThe defeat of Cantor, who was not perceived to be taking his primary challenge seriously, was due in part to discontent within the solidly Republican, suburban Richmond 7th Congressional District. Brat exposed this discontent by attacking Cantor on his votes to raise the debt ceiling and end the government shutdown, as well as his support for some immigration reforms.\n\nAt a May meeting of Republican activists in the district, Cantor was booed, and an ally he campaigned for was ousted as the local party chairman in favor of a tea party favorite.\n\nAs of the time of this report, it is unclear if there is a Democratic candidate running in Virginia's 7th Congressional District. The lack of information on this matter is not promising if there is a Democratic candidate.\n\nThis unexpected election result has effectively ended any chance of Immigration Reform in the near future, according to political analyst Chuck Todd. The full implications of this election result are still being assessed.",
    " Title: Deadly Train Accident Kills 16 Migrant Workers in Western India\n\nArticle:\n\nA freight train in the western Indian state of Maharashtra has run over a group of migrant workers sleeping on the tracks, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 individuals and injuries to two others, according to officials. The incident occurred as tens of thousands of laborers have been walking home from major Indian cities after losing their jobs due to a lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Railways Ministry stated that the driver of the train attempted to stop in time but was unable to do so. An inquiry has been ordered in response to the incident. The state government reported the death toll and the number of injured in a statement.\n\nThe laborers were reportedly employed by a steel company and were walking towards their village in the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh. A police officer stated, \"They had been walking all night; they were exhausted and fell asleep on the tracks.\"\n\nUnder the lockdown, public transport has been suspended, leaving migrant workers heading home to walk long distances to reach their destinations. The opposition and activists have criticized the government for arranging planes to bring back Indians from overseas while leaving migrant workers stranded in big cities with limited access to food and cash.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his \"anguish at the loss of lives\" in the accident and stated that \"all possible assistance required is being provided.\" Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, expressed his \"shock at the deaths of migrant workers\" and stated, \"We should be ashamed of how we treat our nation-builders.\"\n\nOver the past week, some state governments have organized trains and buses to bring back migrant workers. Many are walking great distances in the blistering heat through fields and forests to get home. India's railway network is one of the largest in the world and carries about 23 million passengers a day. Accidents are common, with most being attributed to poor maintenance and human error. A 2012 government report described the loss of 15,000 passengers to rail accidents every year in India as a \"massacre.\"",
    " Title: Health and Human Services Secretary Acknowledges Potential Premium Increases in Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has admitted that the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, may not be as affordable as initially perceived. This acknowledgment comes as insurers prepare to release rates for health plans starting on January 1, 2014, when key provisions of the health law take effect.\n\nSebelius' remarks suggest that individuals purchasing new insurance policies could experience premium increases due to requirements in the health-care law. She noted that the law mandates improved benefits and equal treatment for all customers, regardless of their medical claims.\n\nThe secretary's comments are among the first direct statements from federal officials acknowledging that people with less comprehensive health plans may face higher premiums for more generous plans. Sebelius stated, \"These folks will be moving into a really fully insured product for the first time, and so there may be a higher cost associated with getting into that market.\"\n\nHowever, she also emphasized that subsidies will be available for many lower-income Americans to help them afford the increased costs of coverage.\n\nA survey of more than 600 doctors found that six in ten physicians (62 percent) believe many of their colleagues will retire earlier than planned in the next 1 to 3 years. Additionally, 55 percent of surveyed doctors anticipate others will scale back hours due to changes in the medical profession.\n\nThe survey also indicated that physicians and hospitals may become more integrated in the coming years, with about two-thirds of respondents believing that physicians and hospitals will become more integrated. In the last two years, 31 percent of respondents moved into a larger practice. Nearly eight in ten believe midlevel providers will play a larger role in directing primary care.\n\nFurthermore, biomedical or medical device engineering firms are reportedly laying off workers who develop crucial medical products due to the costs associated with the medical device tax in ObamaCare. The more money these companies pay to the government, the less they have available for research and development.\n\nIn summary, the Health and Human Services Secretary's acknowledgment of potential premium increases in the Affordable Care Act comes as insurers prepare to release rates for health plans starting in 2014. The survey of physicians indicates a pessimistic outlook on the future of medicine, with many anticipating early retirement, reduced hours, and increased integration of physicians and hospitals. Additionally, the medical device tax in ObamaCare has reportedly led to job losses in the medical device industry.",
    " Title: Canada Rejoins USMCA Trade Agreement After Intense Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nCanada has re-entered a revised North American free trade agreement with the United States and Mexico following weeks of intense, high-stress negotiations that approached a midnight deadline. In a joint statement, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland stated that the agreement \"will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.\"\n\nThe new deal, reached just before the midnight deadline imposed by the U.S., will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It replaces the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which President Donald Trump had previously referred to as a \"job-killing disaster.\"\n\nTrump, on Monday morning, called it a \"great deal,\" tweeting that it \"solves the many deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA, greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers, reduces Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations together in competition with the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe agreement reached on Sunday grants U.S. farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market. However, it maintains a NAFTA dispute-resolution process that the U.S. wanted to eliminate and offers Canada protection if Trump proceeds with plans to impose tariffs on cars, trucks, and auto parts imported into the United States.\n\n\"It's a good day for Canada,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as he left his office. Trudeau stated he would have more to say on Monday.\n\n\"We celebrate a trilateral deal. The door closes on trade fragmentation in the region,\" Jesus Seade, trade negotiator for Mexico's incoming president, said via Twitter. Representatives for the government of Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador have called a press conference to discuss details of the trade deal on Monday.\n\nCanada, the United States' second-largest trading partner, was excluded when the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement last month to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trump administration officially notified Congress of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement on Aug. 31. This started a 90-day clock that would allow outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to sign the new pact before he leaves office on Dec. 1.\n\nTrump threatened to proceed with a revamped NAFTA, with or without Canada. It was unclear, however, whether Trump had the authority from Congress to pursue a revamped NAFTA with only Mexico.\n\nSome lawmakers immediately expressed relief that Canada had been reinstated in the regional trading bloc. \"I am pleased that the Trump administration was able to strike a deal to modernize NAFTA with both Mexico and Canada,\" said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. \"NAFTA is a proven success.\"\n\nNAFTA dismantled most trade barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, leading to a surge in trade between the three countries. However, Trump and other critics argued that it encouraged manufacturers to move south of the border to take advantage of low-wage Mexican wages, costing American jobs.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to rewrite NAFTA - or get rid of it. Talks on a rewrite began more than a year ago. To appease Trump, Mexico agreed in August to provisions that would require 40 percent to 45 percent of a car to be built in countries where auto workers earn at least $16 an hour to qualify for NAFTA's duty-free benefits.\n\nIt was surprising that the United States found it easier to cut a deal with Mexico than with Canada, a longtime ally with a high-wage economy similar to America's. \"When this got started, Canada was the teacher's pet and Mexico was the problem child,\" said Michael Camunez, president of Monarch Global Strategies and former U.S. Commerce Department official.\n\nHowever, relations between Ottawa and Washington soured. In the aftermath of a disastrous G-7 summit in Quebec in June, Trump called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest.\" The two countries rely economically on each other. Canada is by far the No. 1 destination for U.S. exports, and the U.S. market accounts for 75 percent of what Canada sells abroad.",
    " Title: Cruz Wins Majority of North Dakota Delegates, but Binding Status Remains Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nTed Cruz claimed a majority of delegates in North Dakota on Sunday, though the delegates are not bound to him, leaving their loyalty uncertain. The state selected 25 national delegates, with 18 of those on a list of preferred delegates that Cruz circulated, marking a clear win for the Texas senator.\n\nThe delegates met Sunday evening, just as the convention ended, and selected State Party Chairman Kelly Armstrong to be chair of their convention delegation. Republican National Committeeman Curly Haugland and RNC Committeewoman Sandy Boehler were chosen to serve on the powerful convention rules committee.\n\nParty leaders made up many of the slots, including Governor Jack Dalrymple, First Lady Betsy Dalrymple, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, and top party donors. However, party activists won a good number of slots as well.\n\nDelegates who said they were supporting Cruz on Sunday were adamant in their support. Rick Becker, who ran a close race for the Republican nomination for governor at the convention, said, \"I don't want to hold out making a decision in order to be wooed by candidates.\" He added, \"I'm always standing by principle, as boring as that might be. I know I'm going to support Cruz. I can't fathom what would occur.\"\n\nWith the delegates formally unbound and free to make their own decisions at the national convention, it would be impossible to declare North Dakota's results a clear win for any of the three campaigns. However, the race was on Sunday evening to do just that anyway. The Cruz campaign sought to portray the results as an unequivocal win.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to have the vote of confidence of Republican voters in North Dakota who delivered such a resounding victory today,\" Cruz said in a statement. \"As I met them over the weekend, North Dakota Republicans recognized that I am the only candidate who can move this country forward by protecting freedom and liberty.\"\n\nEven though none of the 17 national delegates contacted by CNN said they were voting for Kasich, the Ohio governor's campaign claimed a victory of sorts Sunday evening. Top Kasich strategist John Weaver tweeted, \"Cruz strong arm tactics fail in ND, where he lost key floor vote & helped elect delegates who will vote @johnkasich in Cleveland. #NDGOP16.\"\n\nFormer candidate Ben Carson rallied more than 1,600 state delegates for Trump Sunday morning, with a speech focused heavily on faith and his efforts to teach Trump religion and spirituality. Behind the scenes, he lobbied North Dakota Republican brass one-on-one. Ahead of Sunday's speech, he pulled Haugland into a private meeting and also met privately with former Governor Ed Schafer the night before.\n\nAs the delegates packed into this Fargo hockey arena for the final day of their state convention, the Trump, Cruz, and Kasich campaigns worked furiously to identify supporters. Republicans were scheduled to vote for 25 national delegates from a list of 74 nominated delegates.\n\nHowever, North Dakota's unique delegate selection process, which lets delegates vote for whichever candidate they prefer at the national convention, led to much battling between the campaigns. North Dakota's lone congressman, Rep. Kevin Cramer, endorsed Trump Sunday, shortly before North Dakota Republicans began selecting the delegates to the national convention.\n\nBecause the delegates will be unbound, they are not formally committed to any campaign. However, that did not stop the campaigns from working to set expectations so they could claim victory. Trump adviser Barry Bennett told CNN that \"a plurality\" on the list of 25 preferred were leaning toward Trump after a strong lobbying effort from Cramer, who Bennett called the Trump operation's \"Sherpa\" over the course of the hectic weekend.\n\n\"We'll be drinking champagne here all day,\" Bennett said, if the slate of 25 delegates picked by party leaders earlier this weekend passes in the convention. Of the 25 people the party leaders put forward, 16 were chosen, and nine new delegates were selected.\n\nStill, as is the case on the ground in states around the country, Cruz's campaign has had a strong presence in and around the convention. In addition to Cruz's speech on Saturday, Carly Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and top Cruz surrogate, has been meeting publicly and privately with potential delegates since Friday.\n\nAs many as 10 of the delegates on the preferred list have indicated some or solid public support for Cruz. Kasich's delegate wranglers were equally optimistic Saturday after reviewing the list of party picks, saying they saw at least 20 on their who could be swayed to their side.\n\nIn the end, however, the decisions will not be known until the delegates place their vote on the first ballot at the national convention in Cleveland.",
    " Title: Sequestration Cuts Affect Military Tuition Assistance and Veterans' Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe $85 billion in sequestration cuts, which took effect at the beginning of March, will not spare soldiers, veterans, or other federal programs designed to support servicemen and women. The Pentagon, as well as other federal agencies, have announced cuts to programs such as tuition assistance and housing assistance for homeless veterans.\n\nUnder a federal housing program run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), roughly 100,000 Americans, including homeless and formerly homeless veterans, will lose assistance due to the sequester. The program provides state grants to help veterans secure housing. HUD spokespersons have stated that local officials will determine which projects will not be renewed under the program, and they are also concerned about the impact of the cuts on the elderly and children.\n\nActive duty military personnel will also feel the impact of sequestration. The Army announced on Friday that it will no longer accept applications for its Tuition Assistance program, which provides soldiers with up to $4,500 annually to take courses at accredited schools toward high school and college diplomas. The Army could not provide a specific amount on how much the cuts would save, but 201,000 soldiers used the program in fiscal 2012 at a cost of $373 million. The Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard have also announced suspensions of their programs.\n\nPete Hegseth, chief executive of Concerned Veterans for America, stated that Washington needs to examine its spending and cut the waste. However, he said, officials have gone after \"low hanging fruit\" such as military tuition assistance because special interest groups have protected big items like weapons systems.\n\nCongress allowed the drastic, across-the-board cuts in 2011 after failing to reach a deal on a more measured approach to fixing Washington's fiscal problems. The cuts, which will equal roughly $1.2 trillion over 10 years, kicked in on March 1. The Department of Veterans Affairs is spared from the cuts, but cuts elsewhere in the federal budget will nevertheless affect veterans.\n\nA Labor Department program that provides employment-related assistance for veterans is also being cut. An agency spokesman stated on Monday that tens of thousands of veterans under the VETS job-training program will no longer receive assistance. He also stated that reaching a more exact number is difficult because the cuts were made in overlapping budgets, and the full impact will be felt over the next couple of months. However, he confirmed that 33,000 fewer veterans will be served under a state grant program known as Jobs for Veterans.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans have expressed concerns about the federal government's spending amid the cuts to veterans and others, including $250 million in aid to Egypt and an essentially untouchable, $400 billion program to build F-35 fighter jets before testing is complete. A spokesman for Republican Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, stated that McKeon has warned of such consequences for the past 18 months and continues to try to upend the sequester. \"No one has rung the alarm bell more than Chairman McKeon,\" said spokesman Claude Chafin. He also stated that McKeon's objective now is to use House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan's new budget to end sequester, \"not delay, not reverse, it needs to stop.\"",
    " Title: Americans' Unawareness of Economic Policies and Immigration: A Look at the Perspective of Jonette Christian\n\nArticle:\n\nJonette Christian, head of Mainers for a Sensible Immigration Policy, has expressed concerns about the impact of free trade agreements, deregulation of banking, and immigration on the American economy and society. In an article, Christian argues that these policies were not initiated by the American people but were imposed on them, often without their knowledge or consent.\n\nAccording to Christian, free trade agreements have led to the loss of American manufacturing jobs, the outsourcing of businesses, and a shift in the nation's identity from makers to consumers. Similarly, deregulation of banking, which led to the 2008 Great Recession, was not a choice made by the American people.\n\nMoreover, Christian contends that the quadrupling of the U.S. population due to immigration, as reported by the Migration Policy Institute, was not a decision made by the American people. She questions whether the American people ever asked Congress to increase immigration levels, suggesting that the influx of immigrants was not a response to a demand from the American public.\n\nChristian refers to this trio of policies - free trade, deregulation, and immigration - as the \"globalist's trifecta.\" She argues that these policies were sold to Congress as a means to stimulate economic growth, and while they did lead to economic growth, they also resulted in winners and losers. The winners, primarily bankers and investors, grew rich, while wages for working Americans stagnated, good jobs disappeared, and the middle class shrank.\n\nChristian criticizes the globalist trifecta for shaping political discourse, convincing both parties that America requires an incessant influx of foreign labor. She points out that even in Maine, this trifecta is influencing political debates.\n\nThe Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of billionaires, corporate CEOs, and their politicians, is a particular focus of Christian's criticism. She accuses the Partnership of using data and studies to promote the need for increased immigration, often without providing links or considering costs or labor impacts. Christian alleges that Maine editorial writers frequently cite data from the Partnership's website to support the \"Maine needs immigrants\" narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, Christian calls for Americans to think for themselves and question the economic policies that have been imposed on them. She suggests that if employers want to benefit from doing business in America, they should offer livable wages, rather than relying on foreign workers to undercut domestic wages.",
    " Title: New Polls Show Tightening Presidential Race in Swing States\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CBS News/New York Times/Quinnipiac University poll has revealed a tightening presidential race in three crucial swing states. The poll shows President Barack Obama's lead in Florida narrowing to three points, down from a six-point advantage at the end of July. In Ohio, Obama still leads Mitt Romney by six points, while in Wisconsin, the race is virtually tied, with a two-point difference between the two candidates.\n\nThe poll results indicate that Republican nominee Mitt Romney is closing the gap in these battleground states. However, it's important to note that these polls are based on samples that some analysts argue are flawed.\n\nEd Morrissey, a political blogger, points out the partisan splits in the samples. In Florida, the poll sample is Democratic-leaning by 6 percentage points, while the mean Florida electorate from 2008 and 2010 was only Democratic-leaning by 1.5 percentage points. In Ohio, the poll sample is Democratic-leaning by 8 percentage points, while the mean '08/'10 hybrid Buckeye State electorate was Democratic-leaning by 3.5 percentage points. In Wisconsin, the poll sample is Democratic-leaning by 4 percentage points, while the state's combined electorate was Democratic-leaning by 2.5 percentage points.\n\nAnother significant finding from the poll's internals is the under-sampling of 2008 McCain voters in the Florida and Ohio surveys. The new poll's Florida respondents voted for Obama over McCain by a nine-point margin, while the actual election result was Obama by three points. The poll's Ohio respondents backed Obama by 13 points, while the actual election result was Obama by four-and-a-half points.\n\nA recent USA Today/Gallup poll shows a record number of Americans identifying as independents. Romney holds a \"clear edge\" on the economy and a larger lead on deficits, while Obama leads on several other issues. More voters say Obama is attacking Romney unfairly than vice versa, the GOP has an enthusiasm advantage, and the generic Congressional ballot is exactly tied. Romney leads men by eight points, while Obama leads women by the same margin.",
    " Title: Congress Returns to Work Amid Election-Year Politics and Limited Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress resumed work on Monday with the upcoming election year shaping an already limited legislative agenda. Republicans have vowed to focus on various aspects of President Barack Obama's health care law, viewing the law's problem-plagued rollout as a political advantage as the GOP aims to maintain its House majority and capture control of the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) announced that the first order of business in the House would be legislation addressing the security of personal data, part of the Republican's effort to protect citizens from the potential harmful effects of Obamacare. In a memo to House Republicans, Cantor promised further steps to curb the healthcare law, including increased transparency in enrollment data disclosure and efforts to ultimately repeal and replace the law with patient-focused reforms.\n\nRepublicans also pledged closer scrutiny of the administration's enrollment numbers in the health care program. Meanwhile, Democrats will push for a federal minimum wage increase from $7.25 an hour and the extension of unemployment benefits, attempting to portray the party as more concerned with the less fortunate and focused on addressing income inequality.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, emphasized the urgency of extending federal benefits for an estimated 1.3 million Americans whose payments stopped on Dec. 28, stating, \"It's about real people, people with families struggling to put food on the table, to make ends meet, including... 200,000 military veterans who are among these folks who are losing their benefits.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has scheduled a vote Monday night on legislation by Sens. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) to extend jobless benefits for three months. President Barack Obama, in his weekly radio and Internet address, urged Congress to restore this \"vital economic security\" for job-seekers.\n\nRancor marked the first session of the 113th Congress, with few bills passed and sent to the president. The combination of divided government and the upcoming elections is expected to pose an obstacle to major legislation in the second session, counting down to November when all 435 House seats and 35 Senate seats will be on the ballot.\n\nCongress must address several significant unfinished business items before delving into political votes and extended breaks for campaigning. The Senate is set to vote Monday on President Obama's nomination of Janet Yellen to become the head of the Federal Reserve. If confirmed, Yellen would be the first woman to hold the powerful post, replacing Ben Bernanke.\n\nLawmakers face a Jan. 15 deadline to agree on a spending bill to keep the government running and avoid a partial shutdown that occurred last fall. Passage of legislation in December scaling back the automatic, across-the-board cuts gave the House and Senate Appropriations Committees time to draft a massive, trillion-dollar-plus measure to run the government through September. A short-term measure is likely this month to allow the government to continue operating.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate spent a significant portion of last year wrangling over renewing the nation's farm bill after passing separate, competing versions of the five-year, roughly $500 billion measure. In dispute are crop subsidies and the extent to which the $80 billion-a-year food stamp program should be cut, with the House slashing $4 billion and the Senate $400 million annually. Lawmakers are pressing for a compromise that can win approval from both chambers.\n\nTwenty-six senators have signed on to a new Iran sanctions bill that President Obama opposes while his administration negotiates with the Iranian government over its nuclear program. Proponents of the legislation are seeking to gain the support of further senators when Congress reconvenes, with the hope of securing a full Senate vote this month.\n\nAlthough the issue may not be an immediate legislative priority for returning lawmakers, it could become a major point of discussion as advocates and opponents of fresh penalties make their cases. Reid spared the administration a vote in December, but this month he may not be able to hold off proponents of tough sanctions.\n\nThe majority leader did promise Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) a vote on her legislation to give victims of rape and sexual assault in the military an independent route outside the chain of command for prosecuting attackers. Her solution would take the decision from commanders and give it to seasoned military lawyers. The top echelon of the military, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and other Senate Democrats and Republicans oppose her plan. Reid backs it, as do several top conservatives such as Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). However, Gillibrand is still short of the 60-vote, filibuster-proof threshold.\n\nUnclear is whether the House will tackle major legislation to overhaul immigration laws. Advocates remain hopeful, buoyed by Speaker John Boehner's hire of a Senate aide who worked on bipartisan immigration legislation for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Boehner's willingness to stand up to outside conservative groups and tea partyers over the budget. Boehner and Obama have discussed a piecemeal approach after the comprehensive Senate measure stalled in the House. However, some House Republicans still resist any legislation, fearing it would lead to negotiations with the Senate and a final bill that includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally.",
    " Title: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Other Banks Targeted in Coordinated Cyber Attack by Russian Hackers\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigations have revealed that Russian hackers have launched a coordinated assault on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and at least four other banks this month, resulting in the loss of gigabytes of customer data. One of the banks has linked the breach to Russian state-sponsored hackers, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation. The FBI is investigating whether the attack could be in retaliation for U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe attack led to the theft of account information that could be used to drain funds, as well as the theft of sensitive information from employee computers. The incidents occurred at a low point in relations between the U.S. and Russia, with Russian troops continuing to mass on the Ukrainian border despite U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nJPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said it has taken additional steps to safeguard sensitive and confidential information. The company will contact any customers that might have been affected, though it hasn't seen unusual levels of fraud. The absence of fraud would lend support to the theory that the hack had a political motive, according to a U.S. official and another person briefed by law enforcement.\n\nInvestigators have determined that the attacks were routed through computers in Latin America and other regions via servers used by Russian hackers. The hackers took advantage of a type of software flaw known as a zero-day in at least one of the bank's websites, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation. They then plowed through layers of elaborate security to steal the data, which security specialists said appeared far beyond the capability of ordinary criminal hackers.\n\nThe sophistication of the attack and technical indicators extracted from the banks' computers provide some evidence of a government link. However, the trail is murky enough that cybercriminals from Russia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe could be behind the assaults. Other federal agencies, including the National Security Agency, are aiding the investigation.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is working with the U.S. Secret Service to determine the scope of \"recently reported cyber attacks against several American financial institutions.\" The absence of fraud would lend support to the theory that the hack had a political motive, the government official said.\n\nU.S. and European sanctions have altered the way banks are interacting with Russian entities, triggering the ire of Russian officials. In April, JPMorgan was singled out for criticism when it blocked a payment from a Russian embassy to the affiliate of a U.S.-sanctioned bank. Russia's foreign ministry called the move by New York-based JPMorgan \"illegal and absurd.\" The U.S. bank was widely criticized by Russian commentators.\n\nIt couldn't be determined whether this month's data thefts resulted in any financial losses for consumers. The people familiar with the hacks didn't specify whether the stolen information included credit-card numbers or other easily sold financial data.\n\nJPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has warned shareholders in annual letters that hackers' efforts to breach the bank's computers were growing more frequent, sophisticated, and dangerous. The bank expects to boost annual spending on cybersecurity by 25 percent to about $250 million by the end of the year from 2013 levels.\n\n\"We're making good progress on these and other efforts, but cyberattacks are growing every day in strength and velocity across the globe,\" Dimon said in that letter. \"It is going to be a continual and likely never-ending battle to stay ahead of it -- and, unfortunately, not every battle will be won.\"\n\nJPMorgan fell 35 cents to $59.24 in New York trading as of 1:45 p.m. The shares have risen 1.3 percent this year. Banks must disclose when customer data is breached, a process that can take days or weeks. Companies often don't immediately know what information was taken or who was affected. If a theft leads to losses, consumers have more protections than corporations.",
    " Title: Obama Nominates Three Judges to Fill Vacancies on D.C. Circuit Court\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama announced the nomination of three top lawyers to fill vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday. The nominees are Patricia Ann Millett, Cornelia \"Nina\" T.L. Pillard, and Robert Leon Wilkins.\n\nThe nominations come amid political pressure from both sides on the issue of vacant federal court seats, particularly those in the D.C. Circuit. Democrats have urged Obama to move more aggressively with nominations, while Republicans argue that the D.C. Circuit does not need more judges and are promoting a plan to shift seats to other circuits.\n\nIn his Rose Garden announcement, Obama criticized Senate Republicans for blocking his judicial nominees, labeling their motives as political and noting that when they do reach the Senate floor, they are confirmed with bipartisan support. Obama claimed that his judicial nominees have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of his Republican predecessor.\n\nObama also acknowledged that Democrats, too, held up judicial nominations when he was in the Senate. However, he emphasized that the current situation is unprecedented and called for an end to the political obstruction.\n\nFederal court nominations, which are made for life, represent an important part of a president's legacy. By moving three names at once, the president is signaling that he is ready to use political capital on the matter. Critics of the president accused him of moving now to create a distraction from the troubles plaguing various federal agencies and departments, including the Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department.\n\nThe nominees, all graduates of Harvard Law School, are as follows:\n\n* Patricia Ann Millett, who runs the Supreme Court practice at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington, D.C., and has argued 32 cases before the US Supreme Court \u2013 until recently, Obama said, a record for a female lawyer. She also served nine years, during both Democratic and Republican administrations, as an assistant to the solicitor general at the Justice Department.\n* Cornelia \"Nina\" T.L. Pillard, a law professor at Georgetown University in Washington. She has served twice in the Justice Department and was an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Obama cited as \"landmark successes\" her defense before the Supreme Court of the Family and Medical Leave Act and the opening of the Virginia Military Institute to female students.\n* Robert Leon Wilkins, who is African-American, is a judge on the federal D.C. District Court, confirmed without opposition in 2010. Before that, Judge Wilkins spent eight years in private practice, and a decade as a public defender in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne aspect of the nominees that shows no diversity is their common legal alma mater. Like Obama, they are all graduates of Harvard Law School.\n\nLast month, Obama won the first confirmation of a judge to the D.C. Circuit of his presidency, when Sri Srinivasan was approved 97 to 0 by the Senate. In his remarks Tuesday, Obama pointed to \"mounting public pressure\" and \"vocal bipartisan support\" as helping Judge Srinivasan win confirmation. However, he also noted the experience of another D.C. Circuit nominee, Caitlin Halligan, who faced multiple filibusters over 2-1/2 years and eventually withdrew in March.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit holds a special place in the pantheon of federal appellate courts, as it hears cases of national and international significance. The court considers the constitutionality of federal regulations and the actions of federal agencies, and is often the last word in cases, since most do not reach the US Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit is also a steppingstone to the high court.\n\nHowever, Sen. Charles Grassley (R) of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wants to shrink the D.C. Circuit, saying its caseload does not justify 11 seats. He has introduced legislation that would shift two of the court's seats to other circuits and eliminate one seat altogether.\n\nObama laughed with exasperation at the claim that he is trying to \"pack the court.\"\n\n\"We're not adding seats here,\" he said. \"We're trying to fill seats that are already existing.\"\n\nWith the addition of Srinivasan, the D.C. Circuit now has four Democratic appointees and four Republican appointees. However, among the court's six \"senior judges\" \u2013 formerly full-time judges who still hear cases \u2013 five are Republican appointees. So for both parties, the current vacancies have clear political import.\n\nSenate majority leader Harry Reid (D) of Nevada has suggested he may move this summer to change the rules on filibusters \u2013 from a requirement of 60 votes to end debate to a simple majority \u2013 on judicial and executive branch nominations. Such a move, known as the \"nuclear option,\" would add an explosive new level of partisan angst to the Washington scene.",
    " Title: Equifax to Pay Up to $700 Million in Settlement Over 2017 Data Breach\n\nArticle:\n\nEquifax, the consumer reporting agency based in Atlanta, has agreed to pay up to $700 million to settle claims from the U.S. government, states, and consumers over a 2017 data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 150 million people. The settlement, which includes a $425 million monetary relief for consumers, a $100 million civil money penalty, and other relief, is expected to be approved by the federal district court in the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nThe breach, one of the largest ever to threaten private information, was not detected by Equifax for more than six weeks. The compromised data included Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver license numbers, credit card numbers, and in some cases, data from passports.\n\nAffected consumers may be eligible to receive monetary compensation by filing one or more claims for conditions such as money spent on credit monitoring or identity theft protection after the breach and the cost of freezing or unfreezing credit reports at any consumer reporting agency. All impacted consumers would be eligible to receive at least 10 years of free credit-monitoring and seven years of free identity-restoration services.\n\nStarting on Dec. 31 and extending for seven years, all U.S. consumers may request up to six free copies of their Equifax credit report during any 12-month period. If consumers choose not to enroll in the free credit monitoring product available through the settlement, they may seek up to $125 as a reimbursement for the cost of a credit-monitoring product of their choice. Consumers must submit a claim to receive free credit monitoring or cash reimbursements.\n\nFTC Chairman Joe Simons stated, \"Companies that profit from personal information have an extra responsibility to protect and secure that data.\" He added, \"Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach that affected approximately 147 million consumers. This settlement requires that the company take steps to improve its data security going forward, and will ensure that consumers harmed by this breach can receive help protecting themselves from identity theft and fraud.\"\n\nEquifax had earlier this year set aside around $700 million to cover anticipated settlements and fines. The company's shares dipped slightly before the opening bell following the announcement on Monday.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Argues for Military Action Against Syrian Regime as Vote Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has begun to make its case for military action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, as votes in the House and Senate approach. In a speech at the New America Foundation, National Security Adviser Susan Rice outlined the administration's position, emphasizing the need to hold Assad accountable for using chemical weapons against his own people and the potential impact on American security if such actions are ignored.\n\nRice argued that failing to respond to the use of chemical weapons could embolden terrorists and other nations with weapons of mass destruction, such as North Korea and an aspiring nuclear Iran. She stated that not responding could indicate the United States is not prepared to use the full range of tools necessary to maintain national security.\n\nRice's comments were part of the administration's last-ditch effort to garner support for military action in Syria. Later on Monday, President Obama is scheduled to give interviews to six major news outlets, each focused on Syria. On Tuesday night, Mr. Obama will address the nation from the White House.\n\nBehind the scenes, administration officials are lobbying lawmakers to support House and Senate resolutions authorizing \"limited\" action against the Assad government. In her nearly 40-minute speech, Rice referred to her experiences at the United Nations in explaining why international action on the Syrian crisis is unlikely, leaving the U.S. in a position to take the lead or allow Assad to go unpunished.\n\nWith United Nations action off the table, the U.S. is attempting to build its own coalition, which currently includes France and several other nations. However, the administration is facing growing opposition on Capitol Hill, with several senators stating they will oppose a military force resolution. Some senators, such as Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, are urging the administration to pursue a diplomatic solution. Other senators, such as Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, have expressed concerns about the potential escalation of U.S. involvement, leading to ground forces and, ultimately, American casualties.\n\nRice attempted to address these and other concerns, stating that the U.S. will not take sides in sectarian struggles or impose its will on the democratic development of other nations. However, she emphasized that the U.S. will stand up for certain principles, including the prohibition of chemical weapons use.",
    " Title: American Corporations and National Identity: A Changing Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, President Franklin Roosevelt summoned the heads of American industry to Washington, initiating an unprecedented war production effort. Major U.S. companies such as Ford, General Motors, Boeing, and 3M responded by transforming their production lines to meet the nation's war needs. The U.S. eventually reached a production capacity of 100,000 warplanes per year, a feat initially deemed impossible by the Germans.\n\nRecent questions have been raised about the loyalty of American corporations in the current globalized economy, with some companies seemingly prioritizing global interests over national ones. The Daily Caller News Foundation posed the question of corporate American identity to 19 major U.S. companies, but only General Motors and JPMorgan Chase were willing to identify as American institutions.\n\nBillionaire tech investor Peter Thiel has accused Google of \"seemingly treasonous\" behavior, citing the company's development of a censored search engine for the Chinese government, Project Dragonfly, and its refusal to work with the U.S. military. Google's actions have sparked concerns about the loyalty of U.S.-based corporations with global operations.\n\nCorporations have significant influence in Washington, with dedicated offices lobbying for their interests and funding influential trade associations, think tanks, and lobbyists. This influence extends to former congressional representatives, with over two-thirds of those who retired or lost their seats in the last election cycle now working as corporate lobbyists, marking a record level.\n\nThe question remains about the sustainability of this corporate influence in the American political landscape. As corporations grow more global in their operations and priorities, some argue that the interests of American citizens may be at risk. The balance between corporate and national interests is a topic of ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Project Veritas' Claim of CBS News Staging COVID-19 Testing Line Met with Denial from CBS and Cherry Health\n\nArticle:\n\nRight-wing activist group Project Veritas published an article on May 6, claiming that a CBS News crew orchestrated a staged COVID-19 testing line at the Cherry Medical Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The story quickly spread on Twitter and was picked up by outlets including the Wall Street Journal, The Daily Beast, and entertainment news website Deadline.\n\nIn a video accompanying the Project Veritas article, Project Veritas founder James O' Keefe states that an insider from a Grand Rapids medical center claimed CBS News created a fake testing line, diverting doctors and medical personnel away from treating patients to stage the event for CBS News and their national morning show.\n\nHowever, CBS issued a statement denying any involvement in orchestrating the line, placing the blame on Cherry Health. The statement, included in the original article, states, \"CBS News did not stage anything at the Cherry Health facility... Any suggestion to the contrary is 100% false.\"\n\nThe statement was framed as a \"BREAKING\" update by O' Keefe, who claimed the statement came in response to the article. However, the statement was delivered to Project Veritas on May 5, a day before publication.\n\nThe insider's identity and role at the facility were not revealed by Project Veritas, but in his interview with O' Keefe, the insider reveals that he grew suspicious after witnessing the alleged staging, but had no direct knowledge of who was responsible. Only one person in the hidden footage mentions CBS, saying \"apparently the news crew wanted more people in the line.\" The basis for this claim is never explored, and other employees of Cherry Health were caught on camera putting the blame not on CBS but on Cherry Health's director of quality and information.\n\nA representative from CBS reiterated the statement provided to Project Veritas when contacted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check. In a statement provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check by a representative of Cherry Health Medical Center via email, Cherry Health CEO Tasha Blackman concurred that, to her knowledge, \"CBS This Morning did not stage any part of their visit to our site.\" Blackman also denied that she had instructed staff to get into the line, but when asked if that was true of other members of Cherry Health's leadership team as well, Blackman stated:\n\n\"I was not aware of any staging that took place. Cherry Health has had a process of pre-screening individuals for COVID-19 testing. On the day of the CBS interview we had 34 prescreened individuals that came for testing. I was not asked for help on any staging, nor was I aware that any staging activities were going on. The only requests we had were tied to the number of patients being tested that day and the PPE supply that we had in place.\"\n\nIt seems some staging took place at Cherry Health during filming for the CBS news segment, but given the statements by the parties involved and O' Keefe's history of misleadingly editing videos, Project Veritas' presentation of events deserves a healthy dose of skepticism.",
    " Title: Federal Immigration Authorities Implement Deportation Halt, Ignoring Eligibility Rules in Some Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal immigration authorities have begun granting tentative legal status to some illegal immigrants under President Obama's deportation halt, with some cases reportedly being approved despite not meeting the administration's eligibility criteria. According to Rep. Lamar Smith, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, illegal immigrants who have been in the U.S. for less than five years have had their deportations canceled, contrary to the five-year mark listed by President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet A. Napolitano as one of the criteria.\n\nThe documents obtained by Rep. Smith detail how U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) officers are instructed to actively search for illegal immigrants who may be eligible for their cases to be dropped. These illegal immigrants would then be granted tentative status.\n\n\"President Obama is granting amnesty to illegal immigrants behind Americans' backs,\" Mr. Smith said. He also stated that, although administration officials told congressional offices that it would take 60 days to implement the president's amnesty plan, internal ICE documents show that illegal immigrants have already benefited from it, even though there are no standards in place.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency that will judge most of these cases, has not yet put in place a more formal process for illegal immigrants to proactively head off deportation. ICE will handle a relatively small share of the eventual cases, and their review is easier because the agency already began using broad prosecutorial discretion last year.\n\nLast month, President Obama and Ms. Napolitano announced they would unilaterally halt deportations for illegal immigrants who would have qualified for the Dream Act, legislation that never passed Congress but would have granted a path to citizenship to many illegal immigrants age 30 and younger. To avoid deportation under the new rules, illegal immigrants would have to have been brought to the U.S. by age 16, graduated high school or earned an equivalency degree, not been convicted of major crimes, and been in the U.S. for at least five years.\n\nThose granted a stay of deportation are given permission to work in the U.S., which could lead to hundreds of thousands of new, legal workers entering the economy. The program has come under fire from both sides, with some immigrant-rights activists expressing concerns about the lack of assurances and critics questioning the broad scope of the program and the documentation required.\n\nICE has halted deportations for illegal immigrants the agency knows have been in the U.S. for less than five years, according to Rep. Smith. ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen stated that the agency has broad authority to halt deportations on a case-by-case basis, even when illegal immigrants fall short of the new standards, especially in \"humanitarian\" cases in which the people in question were brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nICE officers are already trained in what documents to ask for and how to evaluate them as part of their jobs, according to Ms. Christensen. Acceptable documents they can request include passports, visas, school or medical records, and leases. Part of President Obama's dilemma on immigration is that the U.S. has the resources to deport about 400,000 illegal immigrants a year, which means it has to live up to that level. The latest statistics showed a backsliding this year, with about 49 percent of all illegal immigrants deported in fiscal year 2012 not having criminal records, up from about 44 percent last year.",
    " Title: FDA Warns Against Purchasing Hand Sanitizer Products from Eskbiochem Due to Methanol Contamination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning on June 19 advising consumers not to purchase hand sanitizer products from the Mexico-based manufacturer Eskbiochem. The warning stems from the FDA's discovery of methanol, or wood alcohol, in these products. Methanol can be harmful when ingested or absorbed through the skin, and it can be fatal in large quantities.\n\n\"Methanol is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizers and should not be used due to its toxic effects,\" the FDA cautions in its letter.\n\nAs the demand for hand sanitizers remains high amidst the resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic, the recent health warning is particularly concerning. With many people struggling to find their usual hand sanitizer online or in stores, they may turn to new brands that may not have previously manufactured hand sanitizer.\n\nThe FDA's testing revealed high methanol concentrations in two Eskbiochem hand sanitizer products, Lavar Gel and CleanCare No Germ. Lavar Gel contains more than 80% methanol and no ethyl alcohol, the main FDA-approved ingredient for use in hand sanitizers. CleanCare No Germ contains nearly 30% methanol, the FDA found. As of June 23, the FDA reports no cases of harmful health effects associated with the Eskbiochem hand sanitizers, but urges caution nonetheless.\n\nIf you have used a hand sanitizer with methanol in the last few months, the FDA advises that you throw it out. The FDA also advises seeking medical treatment immediately if you've been exposed to methanol, as intervention is required to reverse the toxic effects of methanol poisoning.\n\nEveryone exposed to methanol is at risk for methanol poisoning, but young children are especially susceptible, the FDA says.\n\nThe information contained in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as health or medical advice.

    " Title: U.S. Markets Plunge in Historic Drop Amid Coronavirus Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nStocks experienced another significant drop on Thursday, following President Donald Trump's address and the Federal Reserve's actions, as concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus persisted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2,352.60 points lower, or 9.99%, at 21,200.62. This marked the worst drop since the 1987 \"Black Monday\" market crash, during which the index fell by more than 22%.\n\nThe S&P 500 also plummeted 9.5% to 2,480.64, joining the Dow in a bear market. The S&P 500 also had its worst day since 1987. The Nasdaq Composite closed 9.4% lower at 7,201.80.\n\nKathy Entwistle, senior vice president of wealth management at UBS, commented on the market's volatility, stating, \"The coronavirus is scary, and people don't know what to expect. It's like the tsunami is coming. We know it's going to hit any day, and nobody knows what the outcome is going to be.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced it would ramp up its overnight funding operations to more than $500 billion on Thursday and offer more repo operations totaling $1 trillion on Friday. The Fed also expanded the types of securities it would purchase with reserves. However, stocks quickly traded back towards their session lows as investors awaited more aggressive measures to support the economy and target the virus outbreak directly.\n\nThursday's sell-off was so severe that trading was halted briefly after the open for 15 minutes as markets hit the mandated \"circuit-breaker\" threshold used by U.S. exchanges. Despite the halt, the Dow went on to notch its fifth-worst decline in its history, according to FactSet. Even the worst one-day drop of the 2008 financial crisis did not reach this magnitude.\n\nNot much was immune to the financial market plunge. Small-cap benchmark the Russell 2000 index cratered by 11%. Gold fell, oil plunged, credit market spreads widened significantly, and even U.S. Treasurys, a reliable safe haven earlier in the sell-off, ended Thursday lower.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, stated on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" \"We are going into a global recession. After what's been happening the last few days, we are going to see a spread of economic sudden stops.\" He added, \"The trouble with economic sudden stops is it's not easy to restart an economy.\" El-Erian believes the selling won't stop until the bear market hits down 30%.\n\nIn his address, Trump announced travel from Europe will be suspended for 30 days as part of the government's response to the coronavirus outbreak. Trump also said the administration would provide financial relief for workers who are ill, caring for others due to the virus, or are quarantined.\n\nHowever, these measures were not enough for investors, who were looking for a more targeted fiscal response to address the issue of slower economic growth stemming from the coronavirus. Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist for Evercore ISI, wrote in a note, \"President Trump in an extraordinary Oval Office address did not offer up major new ideas on stimulus and only said he'd propose a vague payroll tax holiday to Congress without strongly standing up for any firm size/magnitude.\" He added, \"This effectively kicks the issue to Congress.\"\n\nCruise line shares dropped sharply. Royal Caribbean closed 31.8% lower while Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line slid 15% and 20.7%, respectively. Airline shares such as United, Delta, and American all fell more than 21%.\n\nThe S&P 500 officially closed in a bear market on Thursday, down more than 26% from its record high set just last month. The Dow ended its historic 11-year bull market run a day earlier on Wednesday. A bear market marks a 20% decline from all-time highs.",
    " Title: Lawrence Summers Withdraws from Consideration for Federal Reserve Chair Position\n\nArticle:\n\nLawrence Summers, a leading contender for the position of Federal Reserve Chairman, has withdrawn his name from consideration, the White House announced Sunday. In a statement, President Barack Obama accepted Summers' decision.\n\n\"Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom, and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,\" Obama said. As director of the National Economic Council, Summers oversaw the administration's response to the economic and financial crisis early in Obama's first term.\n\nHowever, Summers faced opposition from some Democrats, including members of the Senate Banking Committee. Summers alluded to the opposition to his candidacy in a letter he sent to Obama Sunday to formally withdraw from consideration.\n\n\"I have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the Federal Reserve, the administration, or ultimately, the interests of the nation's ongoing economic recovery,\" he wrote.\n\nSummers' ascent to the top of the list to succeed Bernanke rankled some of the president's liberal supporters. He was seen as having been too cozy with Wall Street and was criticized for controversial comments he made about women and math and science.\n\nShaunna Thomas, co-founder of the women's rights group UltraViolet, welcomed Summers' withdrawal, saying she hopes it serves as \"a reminder to all that sexism has no place anywhere in society and certainly not in the highest levels of our government.\" Thomas called on Obama to nominate current Fed vice chairwoman Janet Yellen, another candidate on Obama's short list, to take over Bernanke's job.\n\nObama vigorously defended Summers in recent weeks, both in public comments and in closed-door meetings with lawmakers.\n\n\"I will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his guidance and counsel in the future,\" Obama said Sunday.\n\nSummers' decision could make Yellen the leading candidate to replace Bernanke. Yellen, who became a member of the Fed's board of governors in 1994, would be the first woman to run the Fed. Obama is expected to announce his nomination as early as this month. Bernanke's term ends Jan. 31, 2014.",
    " Title: North Korea Bars South Korean Workers from Joint Industrial Park\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has barred South Korean workers from entering the Kaesong industrial complex, a jointly run factory park located just over the heavily fortified border, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two Koreas. The move comes a day after North Korea announced plans to restart its long-shuttered plutonium reactor and a uranium enrichment plant, facilities that could potentially produce fuel for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Kaesong industrial park, which started producing goods in 2004, has been an unusual point of cooperation in an otherwise hostile relationship between the Koreas. The continued operation of the park, even during periods of high tension, has reassured foreign multinationals that another Korean War is unlikely and their investments in prosperous, dynamic South Korea are safe.\n\nThe North's rising rhetoric over the past few weeks has been met by a display of U.S. military strength, including flights of nuclear-capable bombers and stealth jets during the annual South Korean-U.S. military drills. North Korea claims these drills are invasion preparations.\n\nHong Soon-jik, a North Korea researcher at the Seoul-based Hyundai Research Institute, described the Kaesong industrial park as \"the last stronghold of detente between the Koreas.\" He warned that tension between the Koreas could escalate further over Kaesong, as Seoul may respond with its own punitive measures, and Pyongyang will then retaliate with another move.\n\nIt is unclear how long North Korea will prevent South Koreans from entering the industrial park, which provides jobs for more than 50,000 North Koreans. The last major disruption at the park amid tensions over U.S.-South Korean military drills in 2009 lasted just three days.\n\nSeoul's Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung-suk said Pyongyang was allowing South Koreans to return home from Kaesong. Some 33 workers of about 860 South Koreans at Kaesong returned on Wednesday, but Kim said about 480 South Koreans who had planned to travel to the park on Wednesday were being refused entry.\n\nTrucks streamed back into South Korea through its Paju border checkpoint in the morning, just minutes after heading through it, after being refused entry into the North.\n\nPyongyang threatened last week to shut down the park, which is run with North Korean labor and South Korean know-how. It expressed anger over South Korean media reports that said North Korea had not yet shut the park because it is a source of crucial hard currency for the impoverished country.\n\nAbout 120 South Korean companies operate factories in Kaesong, which produced $470 million of goods such as clocks, clothing, and shoes last year that are trucked back to the South for export to other countries. The industrial park is crucial for the small businesses that operate there to take advantage of North Korea's low wages but not important for the South Korean economy overall.\n\nIt has more significance to cash-strapped North Korea, as, according to the South Korean government, wages for North Korean workers totaled some $81 million last year. This has underscored the risks that North Korea's brinkmanship will result in a miscalculation that leads to an even more dangerous polarization of the Korean peninsula.\n\nBarring entry to South Koreans is a \"slap in the face\" after the South Korean government recently extended medical aid to the North, said Lee Choon-kun, a North Korea researcher at the Korea Economic Research Institute, a Seoul-based think tank. \"I see this as a start for more provocative actions,\" he said.\n\n\"The North has made too many threats not to stop short of any real action,\" said a senior South Korean government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he was not authorized to speak publicly to the media.",
    " Title: Comparative Analysis of U.S. Spending on Social Programs, Military, and Safety\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States stands out in comparison to its peer nations in terms of spending on social programs, military, and safety. The U.S. dedicates 18.7% of its annual output to social programs, contrasted with 31.2% by France and 25.1% by Germany. The U.S. spends 0.6% of its GDP on benefits for families with children, which is one-sixth of what Sweden spends and one-third the rich-country average.\n\nIn health care, the U.S. spends more than its peers, but the system is described as \"broken, patchy, and inequitable,\" leaving people without care and causing financial hardship for those who receive it.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. spends twice as much on military expenditure as Europe, and more on domestic public-safety programs than most of its peer nations. The U.S. incarcerates millions, with an incarceration rate significantly higher than other NATO countries. If Massachusetts, the state with the lowest incarceration rate, were a country, it would imprison more people than all but nine other nations, including Turkmenistan.\n\nDespite these high spending levels, the U.S. does not appear to be safer than its peers. Violent crime rates have decreased in recent decades, but the U.S. still has a higher murder rate than the average among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries and approximately four times the rate in Canada. The number of rapes, adjusted for population size, is four times higher than in Denmark. Robberies are more than twice as common as they are in Poland. Gun violence is prevalent, with firearm-related injuries and deaths among children considered a \"major clinical and public health crisis.\" Additionally, Americans experience a disproportionate amount of violence from police officers. A Guardian investigation revealed that police shot dead 55 people in 24 years in England and Wales, while there were more fatal police shootings in the U.S. in the first 24 days of 2015.\n\nIn terms of social welfare, the U.S. spends roughly double on police, prisons, and courts compared to food stamps, welfare, and income supplements. At the federal level, the U.S. spends twice as much on the Pentagon as on assistance programs and eight times as much on defense as on education. Notable expenditures include the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, estimated to be around $6 trillion, and annual policing costs of $100 billion.\n\nProposed solutions to address issues such as homelessness, universal prekindergarten, reducing the racial wealth gap, and eliminating poverty among families with children are estimated to cost $20 billion, $26 billion, $60 billion, and $70 billion per year, respectively. However, these proposals often fail to secure funding.\n\nAnnual per-person spending in the U.S. is $31,286 on each incarcerated person and $12,201 on every primary and secondary school student.",
    " Title: Allegations of Misrepresentation and Consequences of the 2003 Iraq War\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2003 Iraq War, initiated by the United States under the administration of George W. Bush, has been a subject of intense debate and controversy. Allegations have been made that the primary reasons for the invasion may not have been as stated, and that the U.S. government may have misled the American people, Congress, the United Nations, and other nations.\n\nOne of the central claims is that the invasion was not driven by the presence of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq, but rather by the desire to depose Saddam Hussein due to his attempted assassination of former President George H.W. Bush, and to secure oil resources or control. It is also suggested that the Bush administration knowingly lied about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein to the Middle East, the U.S., and the world, and that he was, in fact, a stabilizing force in the region.\n\nFurthermore, the invasion has been accused of violating the principles of the Just War, a concept rooted in Judeo-Christian teachings and international law for over 500 and 100 years, respectively. The war is estimated to have resulted in the deaths of 4,500 American troops, 650,000 Iraqi civilians, and injuries to 40,000 American troops. It also displaced 2 million Iraqis and caused over $100 billion in property damage.\n\nThe aftermath of the invasion has been marked by the rise of violent extremist groups, such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS), which some argue were drawn to Iraq as a result of the American invasion. The invasion is also said to have exacerbated the longstanding religious and ethnic tensions in the Middle East, particularly between the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam, and between Sunnis, Shia, and the Kurds.\n\nMoreover, the Iraqi military, which was thought to have been defeated or dispersed, has reportedly been infiltrated by ISIS members, who brought their American-made and American-paid-for military equipment and training with them. This has led to concerns about the effectiveness and loyalty of the U.S.-trained Iraqi military.\n\nIn the years following the invasion, American troops have been training new Iraqi and Afghan armies. However, some of these trainees have reportedly joined the ISIS resistance, raising questions about the long-term effectiveness of the U.S. training efforts.\n\nThese allegations and their consequences continue to be a topic of discussion and debate, with some calling for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy and military intervention.",
    " Title: Sotomayor Calls for Greater Diversity on Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has emphasized the need for greater diversity in the nation's highest court, speaking during a talk at Brooklyn Law School. Sotomayor, the court's first Latina justice, stated that a more diverse Supreme Court would provide a more comprehensive understanding of various perspectives.\n\nDuring her speech, Sotomayor did not mention the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, a highly respected candidate but one who would not add racial, religious, or educational diversity to the high court. However, she expressed the importance of having a more diverse Supreme Court and in the legal profession.\n\nSotomayor commented on the current makeup of the court, stating, \"I, for one, do think there is a disadvantage from having (five) Catholics, three Jews, everyone from an Ivy League school, [and] no one who practiced criminal defense law outside white-collar settings.\"\n\nSotomayor's remarks come in the context of a nomination in a unique situation, as the vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in January has not been filled. With the opportunity for Democratic President Barack Obama to fill a seat that could shift the court's ideological balance, Senate Republicans have stated they will not consider confirming anyone before the November presidential election.\n\nIn the past, Sotomayor and some of her colleagues have expressed the belief that the high court could benefit from more diversity. However, her remarks on diversity on Friday are significant in the context of the current nomination process.\n\nSince the nomination of Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, some liberal groups had hoped Obama would nominate another woman or minority. Garland, who is white, Jewish, and has an Ivy League background, is a former prosecutor with a career in the capital and a centrist reputation.\n\nSotomayor did not mention Garland or touch on the nomination. In response to diversity-related questions from Brooklyn Law students, she stated that varied backgrounds help justices \"educate each other to be better listeners and better thinkers because we understand things from experience.\"\n\nSotomayor recounted a 2009 oral argument in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested that her all-male colleagues had incorrectly equated a strip-search of a middle-school girl to changing for gym class in a locker room because they had \"never been a 13-year-old girl.\" The court ultimately ruled, 8-1, that the search was unconstitutional.\n\nSotomayor emphasized that decisions depend on the law, not personal viewpoints or experiences. \"But a different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,\" she said.",
    " Title: U.S. President Trump Threatens Auto Tariffs, Disrupts G7 Consensus on Trade\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the joint communique of the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Canada has disrupted the fragile consensus reached on the trade dispute between the U.S. and its top allies. Trump's tweets, criticizing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have escalated the trade tensions.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump accused Trudeau of being dishonest and weak, stating that the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are in response to Canada's 270% tariff on dairy products. In his press conference, Trudeau had spoken of retaliatory measures Canada would take next month in response to Trump's tariffs.\n\nGermany and France have continued to support the \"jointly agreed communique\" despite Trump's decision to back away. France and Europe have stated that anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their \"incoherence and inconsistency.\"\n\nTrump's actions have been seen as an attempt to disrupt the status quo, following his decisions to pull out of the global climate accord, the international nuclear deal with Iran, and threats to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nThe communique, which appeared to have papered over the cracks that have surfaced in the G7, stated that the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan agreed on the need for \"free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade\" and the importance of fighting protectionism.\n\nTrump's reversal, announced while he was en route to Singapore for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has left his G7 partners scrambling. Trump's counterparts in the G7 had sought this week to find some semblance of consensus with Washington on trade and other key issues that have formed the basis of the 42-year-old grouping of industrialized nations.\n\nTrump's tariffs are part of his \"America First\" agenda, aimed at protecting U.S. industry and workers from unfair international competition. The prospect of Trump moving toward an even greater protectionist trade policy is likely to chill financial markets worried about tit-for-tat escalation that could lead to a full-blown global trade war.\n\nTrump has announced tariffs of up to $150 billion on Chinese goods over U.S. complaints of Beijing's trade practices and its alleged theft of U.S. technology. Canada, Mexico, and the EU are also moving ahead with their own levies on U.S. goods. Tariffs on U.S. imports of cars and auto parts could devastate the Canadian auto industry, which is highly integrated with the U.S. sector, and potentially damage Japan and Germany.\n\nThe Trump administration announced two weeks ago that it would investigate whether auto imports hurt U.S. national security, the first step toward tariffs similar to the ones he imposed on steel and aluminum imports last week. Earlier on Saturday, Trump told reporters it would be \"very easy\" to make the case for tariffs on auto imports using the rationale that they threaten national security.\n\nSuch a move could make it nearly impossible to renegotiate the terms of the 1994 NAFTA pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. On Saturday, Trump repeated his desire to have a sunset clause in an updated NAFTA deal, a demand Trudeau rejected again.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Face Potential Hypocrisy in Confirming Trump's Supreme Court Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nNBC's Chuck Todd, in a series of tweets on Wednesday, suggested that some Senate Republicans may face a challenge in justifying the confirmation of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee during an election year, following their previous blockade of former President Barack Obama's nominee in 2016 for the same reason.\n\nTodd tweeted, \"Will be interesting to see how some GOP senators rationalize the idea that it's suddenly now ok to debate an open SCOTUS seat in an election year. They may fully pull that hypocrisy muscle.\"\n\nIn 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell led the effort to block the nomination of Obama's final Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland, arguing that the seat opened up too late in Obama's term and stating that \"the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.\"\n\nTodd commented that McConnell will have to make a case that midterm elections matter less than presidential elections to confirm Trump's nominee ahead of the midterm elections, adding that it \"truly is an insult to voters.\"\n\nTrump announced on Wednesday that he will pick a nominee from a previously released list of candidates, and McConnell stated that the Senate will vote on Trump's pick this fall. Several Senate Democrats have already pushed back against McConnell's announcement, calling it hypocritical and arguing that the chamber should wait until after the 2018 midterm elections to vote on any Supreme Court nominee.\n\nDemocrats cannot block Trump's forthcoming pick without help from Republicans, who hold a slim 51-seat majority in the Senate. Republicans \"went nuclear\" and eliminated a 60-vote procedural hurdle when they confirmed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
    " Title: Violent Protests Erupt in Charlotte Following Police Shooting of Keith Lamont Scott\n\nArticle:\n\nAnother night of violent protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina, following the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by a black police officer. The Charlotte Police Department reported that a gun was recovered at the scene, but Scott's family claims he did not possess a gun, but a book.\n\nCharlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney stated, \"Mr. Scott exited his vehicle, armed with a handgun... as the officers continued to yell at him to drop it.\" The officer who shot Scott, Brentley Vinson, was not wearing a body camera, but three other officers on the scene were. The Charlotte Police Department has not released the footage, citing it as evidence in the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe violent demonstrations on Wednesday night resulted in injuries. One man is currently on life-support after being shot in the head by another civilian, and the Charlotte Police Department reported that four of its officers were injured. In addition, journalists found themselves under attack. A CNN reporter was pushed to the ground on live television, and protestors attempted to throw another reporter into a bonfire but were stopped by police.\n\nNorth Carolina's governor has declared a state of emergency, calling in the National Guard and state police to help restore order. The shooting in Charlotte and a separate incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have prompted statements from both presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, who has expressed support for the police and law and order, stated, \"I am very, very troubled by the shooting in Oklahoma and called for a national expansion of the policy of'stop-and-frisk.'\" Clinton, on the other hand, has made curbing gun violence and police brutality a central part of her campaign. She said, \"It's unbearable and it needs to become intolerable.\"\n\nWith the latest police shooting controversies and the recent terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, these issues are now guaranteed to be on the front burner for Monday's first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump.",
    " Title: NBC's Decision to Interview Alex Jones Sparks Outrage and Boycott Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial move, NBC host Megyn Kelly has granted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones a platform to question the authenticity of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in one of the first sit-down interviews of her new Sunday night show. The decision has sparked outrage on social media, with calls for a boycott and advertisers pulling ads from NBC.\n\nThe backlash follows a teaser for the show, which is set to air this Sunday, showing Kelly interviewing Jones. The parents of the children who were slain at Sandy Hook have been targeted by Jones, who has long claimed that the massacre was a hoax.\n\nIn a statement, Kelly defended the interview, stating that her goal was to \"shine a light\" on an increasingly important media figure. An NBC executive also defended the program, asserting that there was value in having Jones sit down for an interview.\n\nHowever, many critics argue that a serious sit-down interview is an inappropriate format for covering Jones, given his history of spreading false information and conspiracy theories. They argue that the interview risks validating Jones and disseminating his claims, which have had real-world consequences, including inciting violence and undermining institutions such as the media, science, and government.\n\nJones' claims include allegations that 9/11 was an \"inside job,\" that the Sandy Hook massacre was designed to push for gun control, and that there is a secret fungus epidemic spreading across the country. The president of the United States has also praised Jones and perpetuated falsehoods that originated on his show.\n\nThe parents of the Sandy Hook victims have been targeted by \"Sandy Hook truthers\" spurred on by Jones, and a woman who claimed Sandy Hook was a hoax was recently sentenced to five months in prison for threatening the father of a Sandy Hook victim.\n\nIn April, Jones was entangled in a legal skirmish over his claims that Chobani yogurt company's practice of hiring refugees has brought \"migrant rapists\" and tuberculosis to areas near their factories. The company is now suing Jones for what it says are \"false\" and \"defamatory\" reports.\n\nFamilies of the Sandy Hook victims have expressed their anger over the interview, with Nelba M\u00e1rquez-Greene, whose daughter Ana Grace was killed in the massacre, tweeting, \"Every week. 5 years later. Still harassed by truthers. You do NOT give crazy a platform. You're better than this @ nbc.\"\n\nCritics argue that NBC could have used the interview as an opportunity to debunk Jones' claims and provide context for viewers on how he has gained such a large following. Instead, they argue, the interview may serve to legitimize Jones and his falsehoods.",
    " Title: Amazon Halts Police Use of Facial Recognition Technology for a Year, Citing Lack of Regulation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a blog post on Wednesday, Amazon announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition, while awaiting federal regulation of the surveillance tool. The decision follows years of pressure from police reform advocates and privacy activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), over concerns about racial bias and potential misuse.\n\nNicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties director of the ACLU of Northern California, responded to Amazon's announcement, stating, \"Face recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go. It fuels police abuse.\" She called for a halt to the technology, emphasizing, \"This surveillance technology must be stopped.\"\n\nAmazon has advocated for stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, noting that Congress appears to be ready to take on this challenge. The company stated, \"We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\"\n\nLiz O' Sullivan, a privacy activist and founder of Arthur AI, described the announcement as a \"victory for activists and academics\" who have been pushing for stricter regulation of facial recognition for years. However, she noted that it was an \"admission that the entire system of surveillance is flawed, biased, and has racial implications.\"\n\nThe one-year moratorium on police use of Amazon Rekognition does not include organizations that work closely with law enforcement to identify victims of child sexual exploitation and human trafficking, such as nonprofit Thorn, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Marinus Analytics.\n\nIn July 2018, the ACLU conducted a test of Amazon Rekognition and found it incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress, identifying them as other people who had been arrested for a crime. At the time, Amazon attributed the high number of false positives to the ACLU setting the \"confidence rate\" in the system lower than the recommended level.\n\nThe announcement follows a similar pledge from IBM, with CEO Arvind Krishna writing a letter to Congress on Monday, stating that the company would no longer develop or research facial recognition technology. Krishna expressed opposition to the use of facial recognition technology for \"mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms.\" He called for a national dialogue on the employment of facial recognition technology by domestic law enforcement agencies.",
    " Title: Trump-Russia Connections Raise Questions as Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nGOP nominee Donald Trump has continued to deny any connections with Russia or its leader, President Vladimir Putin, but questions about such ties have arisen due to an increasingly tangled web of connections between Trump and key players in his campaign, particularly chairman Paul Manafort, with Russia over the years.\n\nThe Guardian, a major British newspaper, reported on Saturday that Trump himself added fuel to the growing fire this week when he urged Russia to find and turn over more than 30,000 emails missing from Hillary Clinton's private email server, and then by insisting in a Fox News interview that he was being sarcastic.\n\nHowever, a law enforcement official has told The New York Times that the \"same adversary\" that hacked the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's emails has also hacked Clinton's campaign computer system. \"These are sophisticated actors,\" the official told the Times. \"We can't say 100% that Mr. Putin had a hand in any of this, but this kind of meddling in other countries\u2019 affairs is part of Russia\u2019s toolkit,\" Alina Polyakova, deputy director of the Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council, told The Guardian.\n\nTrump foreign policy adviser Joseph Schmitz, however, denied a connection between Trump and Putin, but noted it's important to remember that \"we had to negotiate with Joseph Stalin when we had a common enemy called Hitler. Bill Clinton went on vacation in Russia when he was a Rhodes scholar; that\u2019s a fact. If anyone is in bed with Russia, it\u2019s the Clintons.\"\n\nCNN's Drew Griffin on Saturday also examined Trump's ties with Russia, including a revelation that Trump had trademarked several combinations of namesake properties in that country. Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign servers were allegedly attacked by a group known as \"Fancy Bear,\" which is connected to Russia's military intelligence service, also linked to the hack on the Democratic National Committee and leading to the resignation of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nThe speculation is also growing after the Republican platform, approved at the Cleveland convention, removes a call to arm Ukraine against Russia, a move several Republicans have also decried. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman called the change \"deeply troubling,\" while party operative Charlie Black added that the change was \"unusual.\"\n\nThe Guardian also notes that Trump's ties with Russia go back as far as 1987, when it was still the Soviet Union. More recently, in 2013, Trump traveled to Moscow to meet with Putin to discuss airing his Miss Universe beauty pageant from there. Moscow billionaire Aras Agalarov, who was a liaison between Trump and Putin, told The Washington Post that Putin cancelled the meeting at the last minute, sending Trump a note and a traditional gift of a lacquered box.\n\nTrump also collected $14 million from Agalarov and other business figures for bringing the pageant to Crocus City Hall, which the Russian billionaire owns, notes The Guardian. Trump also met with Russian pop stars, including rapper Timati and Philipp Kirkorov, who he first met in 1994 when the singer was performing at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. He also spent time there with Trump in 1999 and 2013, and tells The Guardian they did not talk about politics, but \"about the beauty of Russian and American women.\"\n\nTrump also sold his six-acre Palm Beach mansion property in 2008 for $95 million to Russian fertilizer billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. In the infamous Panama Papers leaks, Rybolovlev has hidden more than $2 billion in paintings by artists such as Picasso through offshore law firms from his wife before their divorce.\n\nConservative columnist George Will, who opposes Trump's election, on Friday wrote an extensive opinion piece for The Washington Post linking Trump with Putin, who he says is \"etching with acid a picture of America as ignorant, narcissistic and, especially, unreliable.\" Trump validates every component of this indictment, even saying that the U.S. commitment to NATO's foundational principle\u2014an attack on one member is an attack on all\u2014is not categorical.",
    " Title: Vice President Biden Acknowledges Potential Shortfall in Obamacare Enrollment Target\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Joe Biden has admitted that the Obama administration may not meet its initial enrollment target for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This acknowledgment comes as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has predicted similar numbers in its latest budget outlook.\n\nDuring an unscheduled stop in Minneapolis, Biden stated, \"We may not get to seven [million people enrolled], we may get to five or six, and that's a hell of a start.\" The CBO had previously lowered its prediction for the first-year enrollment from 7 million to 6 million due to technical issues with the government's online insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov.\n\nHealth policy expert Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the independent Kaiser Family Foundation, explained that the lower figure is unlikely to significantly impact the health care law as a whole. He stated, \"The overall enrollment number is essentially an arbitrary figure that comes from CBO's original projections of what they thought the bill would do.\"\n\nTotal enrollment is important for the law's success in its central goal of increasing the number of insured Americans. However, according to Levitt, the health of the people enrolling is more crucial to the law's viability. He emphasized, \"What's much more important in the first years is they get the right mix of enrollees so the insurance market is stable.\"\n\nThe success of the administration in recruiting a diverse group of enrollees will become clear over the summer, as insurance companies begin submitting their rates for 2015. If premiums for 2015 increase, it will indicate that the customers who enrolled are sicker than expected. Conversely, steady or decreasing premiums would suggest that the customers who signed up in 2013 and 2014 met the insurers' expectations.\n\nThe impact of lower total enrollment on the broader goal of expanding health coverage may be challenging to calculate. Under the new law, access to insurance is not limited to the exchange. Millions have already been enrolled through state Medicaid offices, and countless others have purchased insurance off the exchange.\n\nLater this year, population surveys will provide information on the number of uninsured individuals, but this data may not reflect the entire six-month open-enrollment period. In the spring, insurance companies will begin filing quarterly reports to state regulators detailing how many people they insure, and organizations like Kaiser will aggregate that data to create a nationwide picture.\n\nLevitt, however, points out that even this data may be problematic. \"We'll probably have a data brawl over these numbers for the rest of the year,\" Levitt said. \"We'll be able to see how many more people are insured, how many fewer people are uninsured. What's not knowable is what would've happened in the absence of the Affordable Care Act.\"",
    " Title: NRA Faces Cooling Public Opinion as Senators Experience Backlash Over Gun Control Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, during a lecture on public service at Georgetown University, compared the National Rifle Association (NRA) to a hot stove that has deterred politicians from supporting gun control legislation for the past 30 years. Clinton's remarks come as new surveys suggest the public is growing disillusioned with the NRA.\n\nThe parable, in Clinton's words, suggests that politicians, like a cat that has been burned on the NRA's \"hot stove,\" are reluctant to take a stance against the powerful gun lobby. However, the political landscape may be shifting as several senators who voted against background checks have seen a decline in their approval ratings.\n\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's overall approval rating dropped 8% from February to April, while Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's rating decreased by 9% since October. Nevada Sen. Dean Heller's rating also dropped 3% since October/November. This trend is particularly concerning for the NRA, as it is occurring in traditionally pro-gun rights states.\n\nThe growing disapproval of the NRA's stance on gun control is further complicated by the public's discontent with the Republican Party on other hot-button issues, such as immigration reform, marriage equality, reproductive rights, Wall Street reform, and more. The combination of these factors has left today's Republican politicians in a precarious position on gun control.\n\nThis week, New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who voted against background checks, faced the new political reality head-on during a town hall meeting. Erica Lafferty, whose mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was among the first victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, confronted Ayotte, asking, \"You had mentioned that day the burden on owners of gun stores that the expanded background checks would harm. I am just wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't more important than that.\"\n\nAyotte defended her vote, but the questions posed by Lafferty and others like her are likely to persist. The future of gun control legislation on the national stage remains uncertain, but the growing public disapproval of the NRA and the backlash experienced by senators who oppose gun control may encourage some politicians to reconsider their positions.\n\nIn the past, the NRA has been successful in buying elections and influencing politicians through massive spending and grassroots campaigns. However, the tide may be turning, and the heat may finally be on the NRA for a change. For senators who voted against background checks, it appears they have jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire.",
    " Title: Hong Kong District Council Elections and U.S. Congressional Bills: A Turning Point for Hong Kong and U.S.-China Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong's pro-democracy movement scored a landslide victory in the city's district council elections on Sunday, with democratic candidates securing almost 90% of the 452 district council seats. The election results have been interpreted as a repudiation of Chinese rule and a clear message of support for the pro-democracy movement.\n\nThe election victory comes amid months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, with pro-democracy demonstrations and violent clashes between protesters and police. The election results have been seen as a rejection of China's claims that the protests are rooted in Western manipulation and a select few troublemakers.\n\nIn response to the unrest, the U.S. Congress has approved two bills aimed at supporting human rights in Hong Kong. The bills, which now go to President Donald Trump for his signature, request the State Department to annually evaluate whether Hong Kong is upholding the rule of law and protecting rights enumerated in various documents.\n\nThe election results and the passage of the U.S. bills have been welcomed by both sides, with pro-democracy activists urging President Trump to sign the bills into law. The U.S. has long been a supporter of Hong Kong's unique status, including an independent judicial system and a free-market economy, and the bills are seen as a way to ensure that Hong Kong continues to enjoy special treatment from the U.S.\n\nHowever, some have cautioned that the district council elections do not have a major hand in putting together policy, and the real test will come during next year's Legislative Council election. The district council has an actual role in determining policy, and it is during this election that Hongkongers could send an even bigger message to Beijing.\n\nThe election results and the passage of the U.S. bills have also been seen as a test of U.S.-China relations, with some arguing that a veto by President Trump would betray America's values and be a show of weakness to China. Others argue that the signing of the bill would demonstrate an indomitable American will that Beijing has not previously encountered and which it must now accept in all its dealings with the U.S.\n\nThe election results and the passage of the U.S. bills have also been seen as a turning point for Hong Kong, with some arguing that the city's next leader may have less license to chip away at Hong Kong's semi-autonomy. The pro-democracy camp's victory in the district council elections has been seen as a fresh opportunity to cultivate the city's democratic spirit and lay a solid foundation for the future.\n\nIn conclusion, the election results and the passage of the U.S. bills have been seen as a significant development in Hong Kong's struggle for democracy and human rights. The election results have been interpreted as a clear message of support for the pro-democracy movement, while the passage of the U.S. bills has been seen as a show of support from the U.S. for Hong Kong's unique status and its struggle for democracy and human rights. The real test will come during next year's Legislative Council election, when Hongkongers could send an even bigger message to Beijing.",
    " Title: Russian Influence on Bulgaria's Shale Gas Exploration\n\nArticle:\n\nRussia's influence in Bulgaria, a European country with historical, linguistic, and cultural ties to Russia, has been evident in the country's decision to prioritize Russian interests over domestic shale gas exploration. In 2011, Bulgaria faced a significant challenge to the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline, a project initiated by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which aimed to bypass Ukraine and reduce Russia's dependence on transit routes through the country.\n\nAccording to Bojan Stoyanov, a former Bulgarian Energy Ministry official who served as deputy energy minister in 2013, a Russian parliament member, identified as a special emissary of Putin, offered what Stoyanov understood to be a tacit bribe to secure support for South Stream.\n\nThe South Stream project, estimated to cost over $40 billion, faced opposition in Bulgaria due to geological surveys suggesting the presence of significant natural gas reserves within the country. These reserves could potentially make Bulgaria self-sufficient in natural gas for years and overshadow the advantages of the South Stream pipeline.\n\nBulgaria, once a Soviet ally, has historically relied on Russia for 90% of its gas, with a route that has left the country vulnerable to pricing disputes between Moscow and Kiev. In 2009, a two-week gas shutoff from Russia during the winter left Bulgarians without heat.\n\nIn 2011, Bulgaria's prime minister, Boiko Borisov, granted Chevron a permit to explore for shale gas. However, a well-organized campaign emerged to halt shale gas exploration, partially fueled by supporters of the far-right Ataka party, one of several far-right parties that Putin has cultivated in Europe.\n\nVolen Siderov, the chairman of Ataka, denied receiving direct funds from Moscow. The appeal of these far-right parties extends beyond ideology, as seen in France, where the leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, acknowledged receiving a loan of 9 million euros from a Kremlin-linked bank.",
    " Title: Asimov's 1959 Essay on Creativity: A Timeless Approach to Spurring Innovation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 1959, renowned author and biochemistry professor Isaac Asimov penned an essay on the formation of ideas and creativity, which was later discovered by his friend, scientist Arthur Obermayer, and published by MIT Technology Review in 2014. The essay was written as a contribution to a research group funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to develop creative approaches for a ballistic missile defense system. Asimov eventually left the group due to his reluctance to handle classified or secret information, but the essay on creativity remains relevant to this day.\n\nAsimov, who wrote and edited over 500 works, including science fiction novels, delved into the essentials of creativity by examining the process through which Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace developed the theory of evolution via natural selection. Asimov emphasized the importance of making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas, which he referred to as \"cross-connections.\"\n\n\"What is needed is not only people with a good background in a particular field, but also people capable of making a connection between item 1 and item 2 which might not ordinarily seem connected,\" Asimov wrote.\n\nAsimov attributed the ability to make cross-connections to certain personality and societal factors. \"Making the cross-connection requires a certain daring,\" he explained. \"It must, for any cross-connection that does not require daring, be performed at once by many and develops not as a 'new idea,' but as a mere 'corollary of an old idea.'\"\n\nAsimov also discussed the role of isolation in fostering creativity, but he also wrote at length about how to cultivate creativity in groups. He suggested that a group of five individuals, in a relaxed and permissive environment, would be the ideal human petri dish for creativity.\n\n\"But how to persuade creative people to do so? First and foremost, there must be ease, relaxation, and a general sense of permissiveness,\" Asimov wrote. \"The world in general disapproves of creativity, and to be creative in public is particularly bad.\"\n\nAsimov's ideas seem ahead of their time, as they predate radical changes in office structures, the culture of start-ups, and the mass marketing of innovation. Yet, his essay was published at the exact right moment, serving as a timely reminder of the need for true, daring new connections and a call to be informed and eccentric.",
    " Title: West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Robin Jean Davis Resigns Amid Impeachment, Spending Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nJustice Robin Jean Davis of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals resigned early Tuesday, following the state House of Delegates' adoption of articles of impeachment against every justice serving on the court. Her resignation marks the conclusion of two decades on the bench, which has been marred by scandal.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference in Charleston, West Virginia, Davis stated, \"We judges weigh evidence as part of our jobs. Unfortunately, the evidence clearly shows that the preconceived, result-driven mania among the majority party members in the legislature can not result in a just and fair outcome.\"\n\nDavis, along with three of her colleagues, was impeached in the state legislature late Monday. Chief Justice Margaret Workman and Justices Allen Loughry and Elizabeth Walker will now stand trial in the state senate. The fifth member of the court, Menis Ketchum, resigned on July 27 and is expected to plead guilty to two corruption charges in federal court on Aug. 29.\n\nThe impeachment articles allege the justices failed to effectively administer the state courts, approved compensation for senior judges in excess of statutory limits, and abused state resources through lavish renovations to their chambers and unauthorized use of state vehicles for personal travel.\n\nGOP Gov. Jim Justice will appoint successors to any justice removed from office following the Senate trial. Local media and state auditors discovered the justices cumulatively spent over $1 million on furniture and aesthetic upgrades for their state offices\u2014Davis spent some $500,000, according to the impeachment articles, including $23,000 for design services and $20,000 for a sectional carpet.\n\nDavis' profligate spending is just the latest iteration of her long history of ethical quandaries. In 2002, The Wall Street Journal reported Davis participated in a case from which her husband, a successful plaintiffs lawyer, stood to benefit financially. A legal ethics expert who taught Davis and her husband at the West Virginia University College of Law said the justice should have recused herself from the matter.\n\nIn August 2016, \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation reported Davis sold her family's private jet to an attorney named Michael Fuller. Two years after the sale, Fuller defended a $95-million judgment before the West Virginia Supreme Court. Despite the possible conflict, Davis wrote an opinion for the court preserving a significant portion of that award.\n\nTheDCNF uncovered evidence in March 2017 that a Florida-based corporate entity funneled thousands of dollars to her 2012 reelection campaign through an illegal straw donation scheme at the behest of the same attorney to whom Davis sold her plane. The West Virginia secretary of state opened an investigation, though charges were never brought because the statute of limitations expired.\n\nStill, a defiant Davis cast her service as honorable Tuesday, and accused state Republicans of concocting a plot to pack the court with conservatives. \"The people of West Virginia have honored me in three separate elections by placing their confidence in me as a justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals,\" she said. \"I have returned their faith by serving honorably for almost 22 years.\"\n\n\"I encourage each of you to watch this legislative process very carefully and to vote in November,\" she added.",
    " Title: Iran-Six Powers Nuclear Talks Extended as Deadline Passes, Progress Made but Challenges Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nThe nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, have been extended indefinitely after the deadline passed on Tuesday, casting doubt on the possibility of reaching a final deal to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, there were signs of progress toward building a framework outlining elements of a final nuclear deal to be reached by June 30. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf stated, \"We've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until Wednesday. There are several difficult issues still remaining.\" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif also indicated that work would resume on Wednesday.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the sides reached an agreement in principle, according to his spokeswoman. The parties would try to finalize a text later on Wednesday, she added. However, people involved in the talks have said many tough details would still be left over even if a framework agreement is reached.\n\nThe two big sticking points were the timetable for lifting United Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran and the question of what nuclear work Tehran would be permitted to do in the final years of an agreement. Late Tuesday night, diplomats said some inroads had been made but differences on these points remained.\n\nThe Obama administration was forced to accede to the third delay in less than a year in the talks, stoking new criticism from Congress about the direction of the White House Iran policy. The deadline has been seized on by U.S. lawmakers who have warned that they would push for fresh sanctions legislation on Iran if a framework agreement isn't reached on time.\n\nMany lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, believe the terms of the deal won't go far enough in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Senate Republicans are pushing legislation in April that would give Congress the power to approve, amend, or kill any deal announced by the Obama administration.\n\nThe talks have encountered few successes since they began in early 2014. Negotiators failed to meet two deadlines in July and November last year, setting Tuesday as the final day to reach a framework of an agreement and the end of June as the deadline for a comprehensive deal. President Barack Obama in February said he saw little point to any further delays.\n\nAn Iranian diplomat told state-run television on Tuesday that some progress had been made on the sanctions issues. \"We don't want an agreement at any price. We want to guarantee the Iranian people's honor and rights...Our goal is this. Time won't stop us,\" said the senior negotiator, Hamid Baeedinejad.\n\nThe U.S. and its European partners at the talks have long said Iran would only win phased sanctions relief with some U.N. restrictions on nuclear-related trade remaining in place. However, Iran was pushing for sanctions relief up front. Iran was also doubling down on its insistence that after 10 years, it would have no tight restrictions on its nuclear program, including its research work, Western diplomats said. U.S. and European officials have said some of those constraints must stay in place.\n\nAfter an official said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius could leave early Wednesday morning, a senior U.S. official said there was no discussion of giving Iran an immediate ultimatum to make concessions or end the diplomacy. The Obama administration has made an Iranian nuclear agreement its main foreign-policy goal, hoping both to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power and thaw the deeply hostile relationship between the two countries since the 1979 Iranian revolution.\n\nHowever, over the past 18 months, as the diplomacy heated up, the U.S. and its partners have dropped a number of conditions they once set for a deal. As the diplomacy has dragged on, skepticism has risen in Washington and elsewhere that a strong deal can be reached. Critics of the diplomacy say the U.S. and other powers have accepted terms that will embolden Iran in regional power struggles and do little over time to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons. Fueling that debate will be the many questions an agreement will leave unanswered.\n\nU.S. officials have said the deal is a good compromise, which will meet its central goal of blocking any of Iran's paths to an atomic weapon. Western officials say they believe they can achieve their central demand that Iran will be at least a year away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb for at least a decade.\n\nMissing Tuesday's deadline has no automatic consequences for the talks. The interim agreement reached in November 2013 remains in effect until the end of June. At various points in the past decade, the negotiations have appeared on the brink of collapse, raising the prospect of a military conflict with Iran. While diplomats had appeared confident earlier in the day that a deal could be reached Tuesday, officials described discussions as hard-going as the talks dragged on. A German delegation official said the negotiations had been very tough.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Recalibrates 2016 Presidential Campaign Stances\n\nArticle:\n\nOne week into her 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton has begun to adjust her 2008 campaign positions and is seeking to find a balance that appeals to both the Democratic primary and general election.\n\nOn same-sex marriage, Mrs. Clinton now supports the legal recognition of same-sex marriages and wants the Supreme Court to overturn state laws defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. This stance mirrors President Obama's evolution on the issue, who also opposed gay marriage in the 2008 campaign but has since re-evaluated his position.\n\nIn terms of immigration, Mrs. Clinton supports driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, a position she held during her last presidential campaign.\n\nRegarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Mrs. Clinton has distanced herself from President Obama, stating that she is not sold on the TPP, which the president is negotiating. Her campaign has expressed interest in addressing issues such as currency manipulation, labor rights, environmental protection, health, transparency, and opportunities for small businesses to export overseas.\n\nCampaigning in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton has also begun to draw more narrow distinctions with the president. For instance, she has expressed an openness to allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, a policy that was not included in President Obama's massive health care overhaul.\n\nRepublican hopefuls and potential Democratic nomination opponents have criticized these perceived political shifts, with the Republican National Committee stating that \"nothing is authentic in Clinton World.\"\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton backer, have defended Mrs. Clinton's authenticity, praising her warmth, compassion, toughness, and positive agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, potential Democratic nomination opponents have struggled for recognition as they hit the talk shows, with hosts repeatedly asking them to draw distinctions. For the most part, they have declined to attack, instead leaving it to voters to sort out the Democratic field.",
    " Title: Ongoing Investigations and Allegations of Russian Interference in U.S. Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past year, several allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election have surfaced, leading to various investigations and inquiries. One of these allegations involves Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in June 2016. Trump Jr. was reportedly seeking damaging information about Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nVeselnitskaya has denied working for the Kremlin to lobby for favorable Russian treatment. However, she has been connected with several Russian-related lobbying groups in the past. Trump Jr.'s meeting with Veselnitskaya follows a series of events involving Russian collusion charges, including the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort due to their contacts with the Russians and questionable business interests, respectively.\n\nSeveral intelligence officials from the Obama administration, including former CIA director John Brennan, former FBI director James Comey, and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, have asserted that they found no evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign to rig the election. However, former FBI head Robert Mueller is currently overseeing the probe into possible Russian meddling as a special counsel, and there are several other Russia-related investigations being conducted by various agencies and congressional committees.\n\nOne of the ongoing investigations involves the unmasking of Trump campaign officials' names in surveillance files and their potential illegal leak to the press. Additionally, some Republican and Clinton campaign operatives hired former British spy and opposition researcher Christopher Steele to compile a dossier on Donald Trump that included Russia-related allegations. Steele's firm may have had contacts with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.\n\nThe so-called Steele dossier was leaked, and the website BuzzFeed published the entire file despite admitting that they could not verify any of the accusations. Other allegations include the Clinton campaign's ties to Russian interests, such as the donation of funds to the Clinton Foundation and generous speaking honoraria to former president Bill Clinton. The U.S. government also approved the sale of a large amount of North American uranium deposits to Russian interests in a controversial deal.\n\nThe Russian government has lost nearly half of its oil revenue due to the innovative American ability to frack gas and oil, which has crashed world energy prices. Russian president Vladimir Putin is reportedly eager to stop American energy exploration and production, and there are ongoing investigations into whether the Russians funneled cash into American anti-fracking groups such as Sea Change.\n\nThe ongoing investigations and allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election have led to a series of resignations, investigations, and inquiries. The picture that emerges is one of a Russian government eager to do anything possible to hurt the U.S., using a disinformation campaign, spreading Kremlin cash, and playing a gullible and often unprofessional U.S. media. The ongoing investigations have also diverted attention from other global issues, such as North Korea's missile tests, Iran's nuclear program, and the Syrian conflict.",
    " Title: Atlanta School District Faces Largest Standardized Test Cheating Scandal in U.S. History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Atlanta Public Schools district has been embroiled in the largest standardized education testing cheating scandal in American history. Thirty-five teachers and administrators were given until noon today to surrender to police in connection with the scandal. This is just the first round of potential defendants in a case where educators allegedly prioritized test scores over actual education, leaving students behind in the process.\n\nAccording to CBS, investigators claim that the Atlanta school district orchestrated a culture of cheating to benefit those at the top. Nearly 200 educators admitted to tampering with students' standardized tests and correcting answers to inflate scores. Some teachers reportedly held pizza parties to erase wrong answers and circle in the correct ones, while one principal allegedly handled altered tests wearing gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.\n\nAt one middle school, 86 percent of eighth-graders scored proficient in math, compared to 24 percent the year before. Prosecutors say that this progress was a criminal mirage. \"The four primary crimes that are charged in the indictment are the statements and writings, false swearings, theft by taking, and influencing witnesses,\" Fulton County District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr. said.\n\nBeverly Hall, Atlanta's retired school superintendent, is among those indicted. Her system's turnaround won her national fame, awards, and over $500,000 in performance bonuses. However, investigators claim she pressured teachers and principals to cheat, and punished those who refused.\n\nOne of the victims of this alleged cheating is Nybria Collins, a 15-year-old student who is reading at a fifth-grade level. Despite failing her classes, she kept passing the standardized tests, leaving her mother to question what was happening at the public school. Instead of being prepared to succeed in adulthood, these \"educators\" left Nybria to fail for a lifetime while they held pizza parties to cover up their incompetence.\n\nThe indictments involve racketeering charges, which carry a maximum 20-year prison sentence. Compared to the length of the damage they did to students like Nybria, that seems lenient.\n\nThe scandal may lead to a closer examination of school choice, at least in Atlanta.",

The speculation has been fueled by the recent gathering of dozens of Kennedy's former law clerks in Washington, D.C., with some questioning if it would be their last chance to meet with him while he is still on the bench.\n\nAt a private dinner with the former clerks on Saturday night, Kennedy made a lighthearted comment about an expected announcement, saying, \"The 'bar will be open after dinner.' However, sources close to Kennedy suggest that he is seriously considering retirement, although the timing remains unclear.\n\nJustice Kennedy's departure would significantly alter the balance of the Supreme Court, offering President Donald Trump an opportunity to further reshape the court. Trump's first nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, a former Kennedy clerk, joined the court earlier this year.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Kennedy has often been the deciding vote in high-profile cases that have captured the nation's attention. To liberals, Kennedy is a hero for his landmark opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges, which paved the way for same-sex marriage in 2015. To abortion rights supporters, Kennedy voted to reaffirm the core holding of Roe v. Wade in 1992.\n\nHowever, Kennedy has also sided with the conservative justices on several issues, such as striking down election spending limits for corporations and unions in Citizens United v. FEC and siding with the GOP candidate in the 2000 presidential election.\n\nIn terms of a replacement, Kennedy might find comfort in the list of 20 judges Trump has pledged to consider for future Supreme Court vacancies. The timing of Kennedy's retirement could be a factor, as a replacement nominated during a mid-term election year could further politicize an already contentious confirmation process.\n\nOn the other hand, Kennedy may be concerned about the politicization of the confirmation process and could choose to remain on the bench until the political climate becomes less contentious. Retiring at 81 would not be significantly different than retiring at 80, and Kennedy would have the opportunity to serve alongside Justice Gorsuch and take up a case on the next term's docket concerning partisan gerrymandering.",
    " Title: Obama's Approval Rating Drops to 47.9 Percent in 18th Quarter, According to Gallup Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama's approval rating has decreased to 47.9 percent, marking the second consecutive quarter of decline, according to a Gallup poll. The survey, conducted among 45,000 American adults between April 20 and July 19, reveals that Obama's best quarterly approval average was 63 percent when he first took office as president. Since then, the approval rating has dropped to a low of 41 percent in his 11th quarter, during a time when Obama was facing Congress over the debt limit.\n\nThe release of these numbers coincides with the president's upcoming series of economic speeches, beginning on Wednesday at Knox College in Illinois. Obama is also expected to push for further action on immigration reform, an issue that has been stalled in the GOP-led House of Representatives despite the Democratic-led Senate having already passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Overhauling the immigration system is one of Obama's top priorities for his second term, and he aims to achieve significant progress by the end of 2013 or early 2014 to avoid becoming a lame-duck president.\n\nIt is worth noting that this decline in approval ratings is not unique to Obama. Several other second-term presidents have experienced similar drops, with some having worse numbers. According to Gallup data, George W. Bush's 18th quarter approval was 47.3 percent, and Richard Nixon's was 44 percent. The picture was far more favorable for presidents Ronald Reagan, with 58.7 percent, Bill Clinton with 56.3 percent, and Dwight Eisenhower with 63.6 percent.\n\nGallup stated that historically, presidents' approval ratings tend to decline in their 19th quarters in office. Nixon saw a steep decline due to the Watergate scandal, while Reagan and Clinton received high numbers because they \"presided over robust economies at that point in their presidencies.\"",
    " Title: Congress Approves Temporary Increase in Debt Ceiling, Averting Government Default\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress passed legislation on Thursday that allows the government to borrow additional funds to meet its financial obligations, thereby avoiding a potential first-ever government default. The bill, which was passed by a vote of 64-34 in the Democratic-controlled Senate, now heads to President Obama for his signature. The Republican-led House passed the legislation last week.\n\nThe legislation temporarily suspends the $16.4 trillion limit on federal borrowing, allowing the government to borrow approximately $450 billion to cover interest payments, Social Security benefits, and government salaries. The deadline for Congress to act again to prevent default is estimated to be August, according to calculations by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Without the bill, the Treasury Department warned that the government could default on its obligations as early as mid-February.\n\nSenator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) stated, \"Failure to pass this bill will set off an unpredictable financial panic that would plunge not only the United States, but much of the world, back into recession.\" He added, \"Every single American would feel the economic impact.\"\n\nThe short-term increase in the borrowing limit was proposed by House Republicans, who aimed to re-sequence a series of upcoming budget battles, removing the threat of a potentially devastating government default and instead setting up a clash in March over automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to affect the Pentagon and many domestic programs.\n\nThe across-the-board cuts, postponed by the recent \"fiscal cliff\" deal, are the result of the failure of a 2011 deficit supercommittee to reach an agreement. The panel was established by the hard-fought 2011 increase in the debt limit.\n\nDemocrats agreed to the debt increase without contingencies for matching budget cuts, as long-demanded by House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Senate Republicans offered several amendments, but all failed on party-line votes. Any amendments to the bill would have required the House to vote again.\n\nSenator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) proposed an amendment to ensure that in the case of a cash crunch, the government would use available tax revenue to ensure that bondholders, Social Security recipients, and the military receive their payments. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) sought to require that any immediate increase in the debt limit be paired with commensurate cuts to spending, which could be spread out over 10 years.\n\nThe legislation also includes a \"no budget, no pay\" provision, which would withhold pay for House and Senate members if the chamber in which they serve fails to pass a budget plan. This provision was seen as a move to pressure the Democratic-controlled Senate, which has not passed a budget blueprint since 2009.\n\nLawmakers are now focusing on the across-the-board cuts, which would reduce $85 billion from this year's budget after being delayed from January 1 until March 1 and reduced by $24 billion due to the recently enacted tax bill. Defense hawks are particularly concerned, as the Pentagon cuts would allegedly devastate military readiness and cause disruption in defense contracting. The cuts, referred to as a \"sequester\" in Washington-speak, were never intended to take effect but were instead aimed at driving the two sides to a large budget agreement.\n\nRepublicans and Obama now appear to be on a collision course over how to replace the across-the-board cuts. Obama and his Democratic allies insist that additional revenues be part of the solution, while Republicans argue that further tax increases are off the table after the 10-year, $600 billion-plus increase in taxes on wealthier earners forced upon Republicans by Obama earlier this month.",
    " Title: Rick Santorum's Waning Political Relevance Tied to Stance on Gay Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the announcement of Rand Paul's presidential campaign gains attention, the political irrelevancy of another potential candidate, former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA), has come to light. This is despite Santorum's near victory in the Republican nomination race against Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nIn recent news, Santorum expressed support for Indiana's \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\" a controversial law that allows businesses to discriminate against gay customers. This stance, in contrast to the general opposition from Democrats, independents, and the business community, has further highlighted Santorum's stance on gay rights.\n\nFor the past 40 years, the heir apparent to the Republican presidential nomination has been the runner-up from previous years' primaries. If this trend were still in effect, former Senator Rick Santorum would likely be among the frontrunners. Instead, he trails in the single digits, a position he has maintained since the beginning of this election cycle's polling. According to the Polling Report, he has not reached 4 percent in over a year.\n\nThe reason for Santorum's low standing is attributed to his strong opposition to gay rights. While this might have been enough to make him a strong contender in the GOP primaries a decade ago, today's Americans are increasingly in favor of full legal equality for the gay community. This shift in public opinion has significantly impacted Santorum's chances at the presidency, despite his other political weaknesses, such as his landslide loss in the Pennsylvania Senate race in 2006.\n\nFurthermore, Republicans are less religiously-minded in their politics than they have been in the past. While many conservatives still express support for using religion to shape government policies, a growing number perceive religion as losing its influence in American life. This shift in religious beliefs and practices has contributed to Santorum's declining political relevance.\n\nThe Christian Right, a historically significant force in American politics, has also seen a decline in its influence. While Christianity has been politicized since the early days of the republic, the Christian Right as we know it today is characterized by its religiously-tinted patriotism and conservative stances on issues like gay rights, the drug wars, opposition to the '60s counterculture, reproductive choice, and the separation of church and state.\n\nAlthough Christianity remains a factor in American politics, the days when a candidate like Rick Santorum can play a dominant role in Republican Party politics may be coming to an end. The Christian Right's grip on the GOP has weakened over the past two presidential elections, as candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney have focused less on their religiosity in their campaigns and religious conservatives have lost touchstone cultural battles on issues like marijuana legalization and gay marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, Rick Santorum's stance on gay rights and the changing political landscape have contributed to his waning political relevance. The Christian Right, a historically significant force in American politics, has seen a decline in its influence, and the days when a candidate like Santorum can play a dominant role in Republican Party politics may be coming to an end.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates' Climate Change and Economic Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2016 U.S. Presidential race, both candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have outlined their plans regarding climate change and economic policies in coal-producing regions.\n\nHillary Clinton has proposed a plan to invest in job creation and economic development in coal communities. She emphasizes the historical role of these regions in powering the nation and aims to prevent their decline. Clinton also intends to honor the Paris Climate Agreement's pledge, aiming to reduce emissions up to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. She seeks to collaborate with Canada and Mexico to negotiate a North American Climate Compact, aiming to reduce emissions and accelerate the clean energy transition across the continent.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, does not consider global warming as the most pressing threat to the nation. He criticizes Clinton's climate plan, stating it could cost the U.S. economy $5 trillion. Trump also points out that China, the world's largest polluter, continues to increase its emissions for at least 14 more years. He argues that manufacturing products in the U.S. is environmentally superior due to higher environmental standards compared to countries like China.\n\nRegarding income inequality, Hillary Clinton states that many hardworking Americans face disadvantages. She aims to ensure that no one who works hard should live in poverty or worry about retiring with dignity. Further details about her plan to reduce income inequality were not provided in the source text.",
    " Title: Senate's Acquittal of President Trump Reflects Malapportioned Senate, Not Popular Vindication\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 52-48 vote, the U.S. Senate acquitted President Donald Trump on charges of abuse of power, and in a 53-47 vote, on obstruction of Congress charges. However, a closer examination of the Senate's configuration reveals that the majority of senators voting to keep Trump in office is a result of the Senate's malapportioned system that systemically advantages Republicans.\n\nThe Senate, with its structure that grants equal representation to each state regardless of population, means that a less populous state like Wyoming, with a population of approximately 570,000, has the same representation as California, with a population of over 39 million. Democrats control a majority of Senate seats (26-24) representing the most populous half of the states. However, Republicans hold a majority in the Senate as a whole due to their 29-21 lead in the least populous half of the states. This means that the current Republican Senate \"majority\" represents about 15 million fewer people than the Democratic \"minority.\"\n\nOn the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney joined every member of the Democratic caucus to vote for removal. This means that the senators voting to convict represent about 170 million individuals, 18 million more people than the bloc of senators who voted to acquit.\n\nTo derive these numbers, a two-column spreadsheet was created, with columns labeled \"acquit\" and \"convict.\" In each state where both senators voted to acquit, the full population of the state was allocated to the \"acquit\" column. Similarly, in states where both senators voted to convict, the full population of the state was allocated to the \"convict\" column. In states where the two senators split their vote, half the state's population was allocated to one column and half to the other.\n\nIn total, the senators voting to acquit represent about 152 million individuals, while senators voting to convict represent about 170 million individuals. As a practical matter, Trump likely would remain in office even in a fairly apportioned Senate, as the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the members present for conviction.\n\nNevertheless, it is worth noting that senators representing about 53% of the nation voted to remove Trump from office, a far different narrative than the raw vote in the Senate suggests.",
    " Title: Charleston Church Shooting Suspect Dylann Roof Captured in North Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nDylann Roof, a 21-year-old man, has been apprehended in Shelby, North Carolina, following a manhunt in connection with the shooting deaths of nine individuals at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The arrest occurred during a traffic stop, as authorities were alerted to suspicious activity, according to authorities.\n\nCharleston Police Chief Greg Mullen described Roof as the suspect who \"obviously committed a tragic, heinous crime last night in the city of Charleston.\" He credited \"unparalleled cooperation\" between law enforcement agencies for the quick arrest. Roof was taken into custody without incident.\n\nEarlier Thursday, police released photographs of the young, white man suspected of being the gunman who shot and killed nine people at a historic black church during a Wednesday night prayer meeting. The FBI was searching for Dylann Roof Thursday morning, noting he is 5-foot-9, approximately 120 pounds, and may be driving a black 2000 Hyundai Elantra sedan.\n\nRoof has been arrested twice as an adult, once for a drug-related offense and another for a trespassing charge. He was out on bond at the time of the shooting rampage, according to court records.\n\nThe Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina are opening a hate crime investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe suspect joined the prayer group inside the church for an hour before opening fire at about 9 p.m. Wednesday, according to Chief Mullen. The deadly attack at Emmanuel AME church, one of the oldest black churches in the country, shook Charleston and sent shockwaves across the country.\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the U.S. House, Rep. Jeff Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, asked lawmakers to pray for the 180-year-old Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and those impacted by the shooting.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush canceled a campaign event Thursday morning in Charleston due to the shooting. Sen. Lindsey Graham, another 2016 GOP presidential candidate, canceled scheduled campaign stops in Philadelphia and New Hampshire this weekend to return home.\n\nSen. Tim Scott said on Thursday that he wanted \"swift justice\" for those who were killed during the shooting. The South Carolina Republican made the comments after catching a flight from Washington, D.C., to his home state Thursday morning.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been a fixture at scenes of racial unrest, said he was likely heading to Charleston. Tips had already come in from across the country, according to Chief Mullen, who urged people to phone in tips to a hotline: 1-800-CALL-FBI.",
    " Title: Five Concerns for Libertarians in the New Year\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the year 2016 draws to a close, many individuals are eager to usher in the new year. However, before popping the champagne, it is crucial to consider five areas of concern for libertarians in 2017.\n\n1. Marijuana Legalization: With most Americans supporting the legalization of marijuana, 2017 could pose challenges for pro-legalization advocates. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed that the issue should be left to the states, but he has appointed anti-marijuana lawmakers to key positions in his cabinet. Notably, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has been tapped as Attorney General, has long opposed legalization and has criticized the Obama administration and the Department of Justice for not enforcing federal marijuana laws.\n\n2. National Debt: As Donald Trump prepares to take office, he will inherit a debt that has nearly doubled under President Obama. In early 2017, the national debt is set to hit a staggering $20 trillion. Estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Budget suggest that Trump's policy proposals will add another $5.3 trillion over the next four years.\n\n3. Free Markets and Globalization: While globalization and free trade have historically lifted millions out of poverty and raised living standards across the United States, 2017 enters with both Democrats and Republicans questioning the fundamental value of free markets. The new administration has promised to intervene in the affairs of private companies, and President Trump has openly threatened a costly trade war with China.\n\n4. Fake News: Hillary Clinton recently referred to fake news as an \"epidemic\" at a public event, stating that the trend \"can have real-world consequences.\" In response, Facebook is testing new plug-ins to limit misinformation and partnering with fact-checking groups to root out false news items, causing concerns of censorship on the popular social media platform.\n\n5. Surveillance Powers: Under a Trump administration, the FBI, NSA, and CIA are likely to see expanded surveillance powers. Some of these changes are already happening, with a new rule approved this fall allowing federal agents with a single search warrant to hack millions of Americans' computers or smartphones at once. Additionally, the United Kingdom recently approved the Investigatory Powers bill, which grants the UK's global surveillance program authorities to create a new government database that will store the web history of every citizen in the country.\n\nProduced and written by Alexis Garcia.

    " Title: Trump and Macron Exchange Words on ISIS Fighters and NATO in London\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense exchange on Tuesday in London, President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron engaged in a heated discussion regarding ISIS fighters and NATO. The exchange occurred just hours after Trump criticized Macron's rebuke of NATO.\n\nDuring the exchange, Trump asked Macron if he would like \"some nice ISIS fighters\" and joked about Macron's response, which urged Trump to \"be serious\" and called for a broader push against ISIS. Trump later took another swipe at Macron, calling his response \"one of the greatest non-answers I've ever heard.\"\n\nThe exchange came hours after Trump criticized Macron's comments about the NATO alliance, referring to it as a \"very dangerous statement\" and stating that the U.S. \"has not spoken to the president about that.\" Trump also noted that France, which was invaded twice during both World Wars, \"needs NATO more than anyone.\"\n\nMacron's remarks came weeks after Turkey, a member of NATO, invaded northern Syria. Macron had previously stated that the U.S.'s decision to withdraw troops from northeastern Syria marked the \"brain death\" of NATO.\n\nIn a separate issue, Macron recently imposed a French digital services tax on American companies, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter. The White House has announced that the tax will be met with tariffs of up to 100% on $2.4 billion worth of French products such as cheese, yogurt, sparkling wine, and makeup. Trump has expressed disapproval of the tax, stating, \"I'm not so in love with Facebook, Google, or Twitter, but I don't want France taxing American companies.\"\n\nThe exchange between Trump and Macron occurred as Trump is set to meet with NATO members during a two-day summit in London. Trump would not confirm if he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Turkish media in late November quoted Erdo\u011fan's adviser saying the country was considering dropping out of NATO.",
    " Title: U.S. Withdrawal from WHO Could Impact Global Response to Future Pandemics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) by former President Donald Trump has raised concerns about the nation's readiness to respond to future pandemics. The move, which is still legally questionable, has led to a potential disengagement of U.S. officials and experts from international institutions, potentially encouraging other nations to follow suit.\n\nLoyce Pace, the president of the Global Health Council, stated that this disengagement could harm the WHO at a time when it is most needed and further diminish America's already damaged international standing. The U.S., which has mishandled its own COVID-19 outbreak, bought up world stocks of important drugs, and withdrawn from global alliances, may receive less support or warnings in case of a new crisis.\n\nIn a positive scenario, a second virus could be contained due to increased global vigilance. The new pathogen would find it harder to spread in an alert world, be rapidly detected, and potentially fizzle out due to cautious citizens. The same tests used for diagnosing COVID-19 could be adapted to cover the new pathogen, and if the new pathogen is a flu strain, existing vaccines could be tweaked to protect against it.\n\nHowever, in countries like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, which have struggled with COVID-19, a second respiratory virus could go unnoticed due to resources being redirected to combat the ongoing pandemic. According to Lauren Sauer, who works on disaster preparedness at Johns Hopkins Medicine, resources like swabs, storage tubes, healthcare workers, and public-health experts are either running out or burning out. A second respiratory virus would further tax the same resources that the U.S. has failed to adequately marshal for COVID-19.",
    " Title: The Decline of San Francisco: A Comparative Study of the City's Transformation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe transformation of San Francisco, once known for its breathtaking views, delectable food, and cool jazz, has been stark. The city, now infamous for its homeless population and unsanitary conditions, has been compared to Bombay, with some of the dirtiest slums in America.\n\nLee Edwards, a Distinguished Fellow in Conservative Thought at The Heritage Foundation, recounts his experiences in San Francisco, having first visited the city in 1964 as a member of Barry Goldwater's political team. Back then, the city was a vibrant hub, with its streets and hills freely roamed. Today, one must watch their step to avoid human feces and open displays of drug use in Union Square.\n\nThe city's shift is not only visible in its streets but also in its societal values. In the 1960s, the city was home to conservative ideals, with the prevalence of \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" and opposition to marijuana legalization. Today, California is known for its marijuana cultivation and a shift in societal values, with the nuclear family disappearing, gay rights taking precedence, and socialism gaining traction.\n\nEdwards attributes this shift to the influence of political philosophers such as John Rawls, who argues that there is no absolute right or wrong, and that the purpose of government is to rectify every injustice. This contrasts with the Founding Fathers' vision of a system of checks and balances to limit the role of government.\n\nThe government Rawls envisions, according to Edwards, is empowered to enforce a theory without any institutional restraints. This, he says, is a departure from the principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, which rely on self-evident truths accumulated through 2,500 years of Western civilization.\n\nEdwards, after witnessing the decline of San Francisco, found hope in Dallas, a city known for its clean streets, optimistic residents, and shining skyscrapers. The young professionals he met in Dallas were excited about the future, offering a contrast to the despair felt in San Francisco.\n\nEdwards concludes that the decline of San Francisco serves as a reminder of the importance of freedom and individual responsibility, quoting Milton Friedman on the significance of what one does with that freedom. The future, he suggests, lies in the hands of the citizens of San Francisco, who must resolve to take back their city.",
    " Title: Study Suggests Moral Disapproval as Primary Reason for Same-Sex Marriage Bans\n\nArticle:\n\nIndiana University sociologist Brian Powell's research suggests that moral disapproval of homosexuality is the primary reason for bans on same-sex marriage, as opposed to public policy considerations. In a survey published recently in the sociological journal Social Currents, Powell found that the majority of opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in religious beliefs.\n\nOne response that reflected the majority of opposition was, \"Because I don't believe God intended them to be that way.\" Powell acknowledges that people have a right to their beliefs and values, but he argues that if public opinion drives public policy, the real motivation for banning same-sex marriage is moral disapproval over homosexuality.\n\nThis finding could present a challenge for supporters of traditional marriage, as moral disapproval does not make a valid legal case. In fact, same-sex marriage proponents argue that such a case would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe longstanding courtroom debate over same-sex marriage has begun to address a particular legal term: \"animus.\" Animus is the notion that a law has no compelling public interest and is driven merely by a moral disapproval so strong that it causes harm to a group that's viewed as inferior. In the case of same-sex marriage, proponents argue that harm is denying gays and lesbians the basic right to marry.\n\nIU law professor Steve Sanders, who is co-counsel on an amicus brief from the Human Rights Campaign, argues that state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional because they're based on animus. The brief will be filed in the Supreme Court same-sex marriage case, which is poised to become the definitive ruling on the issue.\n\nHowever, those fighting same-sex marriage adamantly disagree that their stance is fueled by animus. Such an argument, they say, places blame on every person who supported same-sex marriage bans as having evil intent.\n\nIf animus motivated Indiana's former same-sex marriage ban, said Curt Smith of the Indiana Family Institute, \"that means that the 150 legislators\u2014a majority of whom supported it\u2014and former Gov. Frank O'Bannon had to have hatred for gays in their hearts when they voted for and supported that bill. I just think that's a wrong analysis, but it's also a tremendous discredit to the men and women who serve in the legislature and our governor.\"\n\nInstead, Smith points to specific public policy considerations, such as the benefits of traditional marriages for couples, society, and children. However, proponents of same-sex marriage argue that the public policy arguments are flimsy at best.\n\nFor example, one such public policy argument is that marriage promotes \"responsible procreation\" and thus limits the number of children born accidentally. But since same-sex couples cannot naturally reproduce, they were excluded from the definition of marriage.\n\nJudge Richard Posner addressed this in the recent 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals majority opinion that maintained same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional in states including Indiana and Wisconsin. Posner wrote that if responsible procreation were a real justification for banning same-sex marriages, the state also would not allow people who are infertile to marry. He added that the policy argument \"is so full of holes that it can not be taken seriously.\" He concluded that the states failed to show a valid policy interest for discriminatory bans on same-sex marriage.\n\nSanders, the IU law professor, explained further: If states merely want to \"protect marriage\" by denying same-sex couples from wedding, then why also refuse to recognize gay marriages from other states, prohibit civil unions, and deny domestic partnership benefits?\n\n\"To do something like that,\" Sanders said, \"begins to feel like it's more motivated out of spite than any sort of sensible public policy.\"\n\nBut if that sounds like animus, not everyone\u2014or court decision\u2014concurs. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees states including Ohio, did not agree that animus existed in its evaluation of same-sex marriage bans. The court upheld such bans, a decision out of chorus with other circuits that propelled the issue to be heard this summer in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"For most people,\" read the 6th Circuit majority opinion authored by Judge Jeffrey Sutton, \"whether for or against the amendment, the truth of why they did what they did is assuredly complicated, making it impossible to pin down any one consideration, as opposed to a rough aggregation of factors, as motivating them.\"\n\nSutton also refused to impugn traditional marriage supporters for wanting to uphold what has been a longtime social norm that has only recently been thrown into flux. He accepted policy arguments for responsible procreation as a valid, rational basis for state bans while acknowledging flaws. And even if he did not find animus, he was careful to note that allowing same-sex marriage seemed inevitable.\n\nStill, he wrote that should be a decision left up not to the courts, but to the democracy\u2014 \"as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way.\"\n\nPowell's sociology research notes that public opinion on same-sex marriage has been changing, and he gives a nod to some interesting questions that could tendril off the concept of animus as the debate moves forward. What happens to public opinion if same-sex couples gain more legal rights? Or, Powell wrote, will it subside fears and animosity toward same-sex couples?",
    " Title: Norway's Paternity Leave Policy and Its Impact on Gender Wage Gap\n\nArticle:\n\nNorway's implementation of mandatory paternity leave in the early 1990s, a first in Europe, has been credited with significantly reducing the gender wage gap in the country. In 1991, working women in Norway made about 20 percent less than men, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). By 2010, this gap had shrunk to 8.3 percent.\n\nThe policy, which initially offered four weeks of mandatory paternity leave and has since been extended to 10 weeks, has had a cultural and economic impact. Fathers taking several months off to care for their children is now commonplace in Norway. This shift in cultural attitudes, coupled with the economic benefits, has contributed to the reduction in the gender wage gap.\n\nWhile holding up Norway's policy as a solution for social issues in the United States may be problematic due to differences in size, social progressiveness, and government structure, advocates for gender equality are using the example to support the idea that supporting women at home is crucial for their success in the workplace. They argue that increased investment in child care could help shrink the pay gap, with the added benefit of growing the economy.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, access to affordable child care could help increase the participation of women in the labor force, thereby growing the economy by an estimated $210 billion each year.\n\nThe gender wage gap in the United States is a persistent issue. Women in the American workforce make 79 cents for every dollar a white man makes, and the gap is wider for women of color, with black women earning 60 cents and Latino women earning 55 cents for every dollar a white man earns. This wage disparity costs American women a combined $500 billion annually, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\nIf the gap were eliminated, on average, \"a working woman in the United States would have enough money for approximately 83 more weeks of food for her family, seven more months of mortgage and utilities payments, 11 more months of rent, or nine more years of birth control,\" the report reads.\n\nThe wage disparity between men and women has barely changed over the past two decades, and there has been small but promising movement on family leave and paid time off. A January poll found that 80 percent of likely voters, including 94 percent of Democrats, 80 percent of Independents, and 65 percent of Republicans, characterized things like equal pay, paid time off, and affordable child care as \"good for our nation.\"\n\nThree states, Rhode Island, California, and New York, as well as cities like Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, have introduced their own paid-leave rules. Major tech companies, from Twitter to Netflix to Etsy, have been introducing increasingly competitive and inclusive paid-leave allowances for employees.\n\nHowever, there are still obstacles to overcome. Only 13 percent of US workers have access to any paid leave at all, and \"if you look at the states with the populations most in need, against those that have taken action, there\u2019s a pretty substantial mismatch,\" says Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women & Families. \"The states that need it are not inclined to make their own laws, and that\u2019s why federal action is needed.\"\n\nInvestments in child care are also important in addressing equality, but they present challenges. In 33 states, outside infant care costs more than in-state college tuition.

    " Title: Critics Accuse The New York Times of Hypocrisy Over Hiring of Sarah Jeong\n\nArticle:\n\nCritics are accusing The New York Times of a \"hypocritical double standard\" following the newspaper's hiring of tech writer Sarah Jeong. The controversy stems from several derogatory tweets Jeong posted, primarily in 2014, that are now under scrutiny.\n\nJeong's tweets included comments such as expressing joy at being \"cruel to old white men\" and using the \"CancelWhitePeople\" hashtag. The Times, in a statement on Thursday, defended Jeong, attributing her offensive comments to a young Asian woman \"imitating the rhetoric\" of her own online harassers.\n\nConservative columnist Daniella Greenbaum, who recently resigned from her job as a columnist at Business Insider, has criticized the situation. Greenbaum stated, \"The issue at hand here is not about whether Jeong's tweets were racist or not.\" Instead, Greenbaum argues that the hypocrisy is the real issue.\n\nGreenbaum, a young columnist who has garnered attention similar to Jeong, was censored by her liberal colleagues after publishing a piece defending Scarlett Johansson for playing a transgender man. Johansson later backed away from the role.\n\nGreenbaum has noticed that many in the media industry have rushed to defend Jeong, while allegedly not extending the same courtesy to those who hold conservative views. Greenbaum said, \"The New York Times, and much of the media chose to believe that she was kidding, or to posit that even if she wasn't kidding, her misguided beliefs are not reason enough to fire her.\"\n\nHigh-powered liberal media members such as HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen and leadership at The Verge, where Jeong currently works, have defended her rhetoric. Greenbaum described this as an \"enormous, hypocritical double standard that is entirely unjust\" in the media industry.\n\nGreenbaum also expressed skepticism about how Jeong would react if a conservative were in a similar situation, stating, \"Let's see how Jeong reacts next time a conservative finds themselves in a similar situation. Something tells me she won't speak out on their behalf.\"\n\nMedia Research Center analyst Kristine Marsh wrote that the Times' statement justifying Jeong's tweets was \"laughable.\" Social media users have also expressed their disapproval of the Times' decision on Twitter.\n\nThe New York Times has continued to support Jeong, stating in their announcement of her hiring that she was a subject of frequent online harassment and that her journalism and being a young Asian woman were factors in their decision.",
    " Title: Romney Claims He Paid a Minimum Tax Rate of 13% Over the Past Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has disclosed that he paid a minimum tax rate of 13% over the past ten years. During an appearance in South Carolina, Romney stated, \"I never paid less than 13%\" in taxes over the past decade.\n\nThe statement was made in response to demands, primarily from Democrats but also from some Republicans, for Romney to release several years of his tax returns. He has already released his 2010 tax returns, which showed an effective federal tax rate of 13.9%. Romney has promised to release his 2011 returns before the election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has claimed that an unnamed source told him Romney paid no taxes over the past decade. In response, Romney said, \"I did go back and look at my taxes and over the past 10 years I never paid less than 13%. I think the most recent year is 13.6 or something like that. So I paid taxes every single year. Harry Reid's charge is totally false.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign spokeswoman, Lis Smith, responded with a statement, \"Since there is substantial reason to doubt his claims, we have a simple message for him: prove it... Given Mitt Romney's secrecy about his returns... he has forfeited the right to have us take him just at his word.\"\n\nRomney is not legally required to release more tax records. However, his wealth (estimated at $230 million), the campaign's emphasis on economic issues and tax rates, and recent political history suggest that the calls for Romney to release more tax records will continue.\n\nSince 1980, only one party nominee or presumptive nominee other than Romney has released fewer than six years of returns, according to PolitiFact. That was Republican John McCain, who released two years of returns in 2008.\n\n\"The fascination with taxes I paid I find to be very small-minded compared to the broad issues that we face,\" Romney said Thursday.\n\nIn an interview with NBC conducted during the Olympics but scheduled to air later on Thursday, Romney's wife, Ann, also addressed the issue, stating, \"We have been very transparent to what's legally required of us.\" She added, \"There's going to be no more tax releases given.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Faces Criticism Over IRS Targeting Scandal Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department is facing mounting criticism from conservatives over the ongoing investigation into the IRS targeting scandal, with some calling the probe a \"sham.\" Officials have stated that, while the FBI investigation is still ongoing, criminal charges are not expected at this point.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, described the news as \"absolutely outrageous.\" She questioned the motives behind the lack of criminal charges, stating, \"Why are they protecting the IRS? Why aren't they getting to the bottom of it? If they do not truly do a real investigation of this, there are always going to be doubts, and it is not good for the trust between the governors and the governed.\"\n\nMartin suggested that the administration is attempting to sweep the scandal under the rug and that there is a cover-up. She said, \"They wanted to silence us, and they have done what they can to silence us. We're not going away, but they've done everything they can to make it difficult for us, if not impossible at times, to exercise our First Amendment rights.\"\n\nThe controversy arises after it was revealed that the woman leading the FBI probe is a President Obama donor. Republicans have unsuccessfully urged the Justice Department to remove her from the case.\n\nThe developments have fueled claims of a lack of accountability in the administration over the scandal. The toughest action President Obama took was last May, when he announced Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller resigned at the administration's request following revelations that the agency singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny as they sought tax-exempt status. However, a source told Fox News at the time that Miller was set to resign the following month anyway. Other lower-level officials have faced discipline or left the administration, though the circumstances were unclear.\n\nJay Sekulow, chief counsel with the American Center for Law and Justice, which is representing Tea Party groups, called the investigation a \"sham.\" He stated, \"To reach a conclusion that no criminal charges will be filed against those responsible for this illegal targeting scheme without interviewing any of our clients -- the real victims in this ordeal -- is absolutely absurd.\"\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, questioned how sources could be discussing the likelihood of criminal charges in the first place when the probe is not even finished. He said, \"These are serious matters - but to make this decision before the investigation is completed seems entirely out of order and inappropriate.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that criminal charges are unlikely, unless investigators discover evidence that dramatically changes their viewpoint. Sources separately told Fox News that the investigation is still ongoing, but that they've turned up no evidence yet to support criminal charges.",
    " Title: Hannity Accuses Media, Clinton Campaign of Conspiracy and Propaganda\n\nArticle:\n\nRadio host Sean Hannity, in a statement made on his show Wednesday, claimed that recent revelations from WikiLeaks about Hillary Clinton's campaign confirm long-held conspiracy theories. The allegations include Clinton's knowledge of Saudi Arabia and Qatar funding ISIS, her support for a hemispheric common market, open trade, and open borders, left-wing activists plotting a \"Catholic Spring\" and infiltrating the Catholic Church, and the media colluding to release debate questions ahead of time.\n\nHannity accused CNN, the New York Times, CNBC, and the Boston Globe of conspiring to propagandize the public and posing as objective journalists. He compared this alleged media manipulation to Soviet Union propaganda, stating, \"This is like Communism in the Soviet Union propaganda... It\u2019s really sad but it's also true and it's also reality and it's also the world you live in.\"\n\nHannity further alleged that Clinton's dream of a hemispheric common market, open trade, and open borders was revealed in one of her speeches. He also claimed that the Clinton campaign wanted to face Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nRegarding polls, Hannity disputed the notion that he disbelieves polls or only cites online polling after Trump wins the debate. He argued that the current polls are inaccurate due to extensive coverage of the Access Hollywood tapes and the delayed release of the tapes by NBC, as reported by TMZ. Hannity asserted that the polls do not reflect Trump's debate performance, the latest WikiLeaks drops, or the media's alleged manipulation of information.",
    " Title: Biden Leads Trump by 9 Points in Six Key Senate Battlegrounds, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has opened up a 9-point lead over President Donald Trump in six states where Republican senators face difficult reelection battles this fall, according to a new poll by Hart Research Associates. The survey finds Biden at 50 percent and Trump at 41 percent among voters sampled in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Montana, and North Carolina.\n\nTrump won four of these states in 2016, with the exception of Maine and Colorado. All six states feature vulnerable GOP incumbents: Sens. Martha McSally (Ariz.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Susan Collins (Maine), Steve Daines (Mont.), and Thom Tillis (N.C.).\n\nThe poll found the Democratic challengers leading the Republican incumbents by a margin of 46 to 41. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, meaning Democrats need to flip four to win back a majority.\n\nThe poll was conducted to measure voter appetites for mail balloting during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump and some Republicans have been resistant to the idea, warning mail voting is susceptible to fraud. The poll found broad support for voting by mail, with 85 percent of voters in the six battlegrounds saying there should be a mail option because of the pandemic.\n\nEighty-three percent of voters said they support congressional action to expand access to mail balloting, including 67 percent of Trump supporters. There is near-universal support for mail balloting among Democrats.\n\nFifty-six percent of voters who said they plan to support the GOP senator up for reelection said the incumbent should support a vote-by-mail option. If the GOP senator opposed legislation to expand mail-in balloting, 62 percent of voters said they would view the decision unfavorably, and 90 percent said they believe the decision would have been driven by politics.\n\nFifty-nine percent of voters overall said they do not believe that mail-in balloting is subject to fraud or corruption. The Hart Research survey was conducted on behalf of the Democracy For All 2021 Action campaign. The survey of 805 likely voters in the six states has a 3.5 percentage point margin of error.",
    " Title: Conservative Students Face Harassment and Violence at UC Berkeley\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent years, the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) has been the site of numerous incidents involving violence and intimidation, with a particular focus on conservative students and organizations. One such student, a member of the Berkeley College Republicans (BCR), recounts being harassed, stalked, chased, punched, and spat on during their time at the university.\n\nIn early 2017, the student was chased by a mob of masked, black-clad individuals, members of a fringe political faction known as \"Antifa\" (short for \"anti-fascist\"). The incident occurred during a planned talk by Milo Yiannopoulos, which administrators canceled for safety reasons. Police made only one arrest that night.\n\nThe student, who was 20 years old at the time and a junior, was a member of the BCR. Despite expecting a strong reaction from fellow students for hosting a conservative speaker, the student had never anticipated having to flee from a mob intent on silencing them, as the mob's stated goal was to \"shut down\" the event \"By Any Means Necessary.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the student and the BCR were criticized, not for the violent acts of Antifa, but for staging the violence to lay the groundwork for a crackdown on universities and their federal funding, as suggested by well-regarded political figures such as Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, and former United States secretary of labor Robert Reich.\n\nThe UC Berkeley school paper, the Daily Californian, published several opinion pieces justifying the use of violence to shut down events, with one headline stating, \"Violence Helped Ensure Safety for Students.\"\n\nThe student's experiences at UC Berkeley are not isolated incidents. Members of the BCR have been subjected to vicious attacks, harassment, and \"doxing\" incidents, with their contact information publicly revealed. The university's inaction has emboldened agitators to escalate their harassment, free of any consequences.\n\nIn fact, on several occasions, the university has collaborated with these leftists to shut down BCR events through bureaucratic maneuvering. In 2017, three of the BCR's speakers, including the student's mentioned above, were canceled in this manner: Ann Coulter, David Horowitz, and Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nIn late 2017, the BCR managed to host their first successful event in months, with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. However, to ensure Shapiro's safety, UC Berkeley police closed off the campus and adjacent roads. Several leftist protesters attempting to disrupt the event were arrested that night.\n\nThe BCR took Berkeley to court, and in their lawsuit, now backed by the Department of Justice, the judge agreed that Berkeley's speech policies were unconstitutional.\n\nTo combat the suppression of free speech on campus without resorting to lawsuits, the student encourages donors to major universities, such as UC Berkeley, to follow the lead of Dilbert creator and UC Berkeley alumnus Scott Adams and cease giving financial support to universities that do not respect free expression. Adams, who received his MBA from UC Berkeley, stated that he would \"possibly try to club [him] to death\" if he walked on campus due to his political views not aligning with the campus majority.\n\nThe anti-free-speech philosophy that is prevalent at UC Berkeley is not unique to the university. It lies at the heart of modern universities and is taught every day by professors at major American universities. Nor is Berkeley the only offender, although it may be one of the worst. American universities receive millions in donations from parents and alumni each year, and these donations are a significant portion of their financial support. If donors speak out, universities will take notice.\n\nShould these trends continue, universities will transform into violent echo chambers where intellectualism expires, and Marxist dogma goes unchallenged. Gone are the days where students challenged mainstream ideas in the pursuit of truth, and \"Ignorance is strength\" will be the new motto of American universities.",
    " Title: Republican Governors Leverage Medicaid Expansion to Pursue State-Specific Healthcare Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican governors, historically critical of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, are utilizing the law as a means to implement changes in their states' Medicaid programs. This shift in strategy comes as a result of the federal government's desire for states to expand Medicaid coverage, which has created leverage for conservative governors to push for greater autonomy in Medicaid spending and structure.\n\nGovernors such as John Kasich of Ohio, Rick Scott of Florida, and Chris Christie of New Jersey, who have previously rejected parts of the Affordable Care Act, are now considering the expansion on their terms. Instead of enrolling new Medicaid enrollees into the existing system, these governors aim to purchase private health insurance plans for the low-income population using Obamacare funds and, in some cases, the Obamacare health insurance exchanges.\n\nThe specifics of these arrangements are still under negotiation with the Department of Health and Human Services, but discussions continue, with both sides hopeful for a breakthrough on the so-called \"private option.\" The outcome remains uncertain, with the possibility that these governors may not receive the flexibility they seek, leading them to either reluctantly expand Medicaid or opt out.\n\nThe shift in strategy is evident in the case of Pennsylvania. Republican Governor Tom Corbett, a longtime critic of the Affordable Care Act, recently met with HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to negotiate a deal amidst dwindling approval ratings and increasing bipartisan pressure at home to address the influx of Obamacare funds available to states that expand Medicaid.\n\nThis change in strategy has been preceded by a series of high-profile Republican defections on expansion, as well as more nuanced moves by states like Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas to provide private health insurance coverage using Medicaid expansion dollars. Arkansas' proposal, tentatively endorsed by HHS, to carry out the full Medicaid expansion via private health insurers in the Obamacare exchanges, has encouraged other states, including Republican governors in Indiana, Oklahoma, and Nebraska, to propose similar solutions.\n\nIn summary, Republican governors are leveraging the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act to push for greater autonomy in their states' healthcare systems, with the potential for private insurance plans to replace traditional Medicaid coverage for low-income populations. The specifics of these arrangements are still under negotiation, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Clinton and Warren Criticize Sanders' Campaign Culture and Alleged Sexism\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, has criticized her former Senate colleague and 2020 rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, for his campaign culture and alleged sexism. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Clinton accused Sanders of running a misogynistic campaign and described him as a political phony whose achievements are nonexistent and who lacks the temperament to be president.\n\nClinton's comments come after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., confronted Sanders during the last debate over his alleged statement that a woman could not win the presidency. Warren accused Sanders of lying, and he, in turn, accused Warren of lying.\n\nClinton's assessment of Sanders is that he fits nicely into her Trumpian \"basket of deplorables.\" The New York Times put Clinton's attack on Page 1, reflecting the significance of her remarks.\n\nThe bad blood between Bernie and two leading women in the Democratic Party calls to mind the battle between Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater, which did not end well for the Republican Party in 1964. While the eventual GOP nominee, Goldwater, lost in a 44-state landslide to Lyndon Johnson, the liberal Republican establishment that Rockefeller led would never again be able to nominate one of its own.\n\nIt is difficult to see how this acrimony inside the Democratic Party\u2014over the character, record, ideology, and alleged sexism of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2014ends well for the Democrats. Already, Bernie's backers believe the DNC \"rigged\" the nomination in 2016 by feigning neutrality while secretly aiding Clinton. If Sanders now fails in the first primaries and loses his last chance for the Democratic nomination because of the Clinton-Warren's attacks, it is difficult to see how Bernie's backers enthusiastically support Warren.\n\nAs for Bernie backing Biden, the raison d'etre of the liberal-radical wing of the party to whom Sanders is a hero is that the Democratic establishment consistently sells out progressive values. Sanders' crowd consists of true believers, a trademark of whom is militancy. Such folks often prefer defeat behind a principled leader to victory for a corporatist Democrat they regard as the enemy within.\n\nAssume Bernie defeats Warren in Iowa, bests Biden in New Hampshire, and then goes on to win the nomination. Would women, a majority of whom vote Democratic, and who are indispensable to party victory, surge to the polls to install a president whom Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren describe as a sexist who ruined their own presidential hopes? Would Democratic women come out to vote for a candidate who was responsible, in two successive presidential elections, for keeping the glass ceiling firmly intact over the heads of the Democratic Party's leading female candidates?\n\nTen days before the Iowa caucuses, the great unifier of the Democratic Party remains Donald Trump. But now, with Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina dead ahead, the Democrats' focus is becoming: Who should replace Trump? The rival claims of the constituent elements inside the party are rising to the fore. And what they reveal is a Democratic Party that is a coalition of groups that seem to be dividing along the lines of ideology, politics, race, class, and culture.\n\nConsider the most loyal of Democratic constituents in presidential elections: African Americans. They are 13% of the electorate but a fourth of the national Democratic vote. Yet, of the six candidates for the nomination on stage in the last debate, not one was African American. Not one was Hispanic or Asian. The lone outsider rising in the polls is another white man, a multibillionaire who is willing to spend a billion dollars to buy the presidential nomination of the party of the common man.",
    " Title: U.S. Acknowledges Cash Payment to Iran Was Used as Leverage for Prisoner Release\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has confirmed that a $400 million cash payment to Iran in January was used as leverage to secure the release of American prisoners, sparking criticism that the transaction amounted to a ransom payment. State Department spokesman John Kirby confirmed that the U.S. withheld possession of the cash until a plane carrying the freed Americans had departed from Tehran.\n\nDuring a State Department news briefing, Mr. Kirby stated, \"If you're asking me was there a connection in that regard, at the endgame, I'm not going to deny that.\" He added, \"We took advantage of leverage that we felt we could have to make sure that they got out safely and efficiently.\"\n\nThe revelation follows a report in The Wall Street Journal detailing that an Iranian cargo plane was not permitted by the U.S. to leave Geneva with $400 million in euros, Swiss francs, and other currencies stacked on shipping pallets until the Americans had left Tehran. The exchange took place on Jan. 17.\n\nAdministration officials, including President Barack Obama, have maintained that the cash payment was not a ransom because the $400 million was money the U.S. owed Iran to settle a failed arms deal from more than three decades ago.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, however, have criticized the handling of the payment and the timing of the Americans' release. U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) stated, \"If it quacks like a duck, it's a duck. If a cash payment is contingent on a hostage release, it's a ransom. The truth matters, and the president owes the American people an explanation.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) added, \"The latest reports about the cash payment also send a message to extremists that 'the United States will pay cold, hard cash for hostages.'\"\n\nRepublican leaders in Congress have announced plans to hold hearings on the cash transfer in September. House Speaker Paul Ryan stated Thursday, \"The president owes the American people a full accounting of his actions and the dangerous precedent he has set.\"\n\nMr. Kirby reiterated that the payment did not constitute ransom. \"We don't pay ransom,\" he said. Instead, he portrayed the cash as a useful tool, stating, \"It would have been foolish, imprudent, irresponsible for us not to try to maintain maximum leverage.\"\n\nU.S. officials also maintain that the prisoner release and the arms-deal settlement were negotiated through separate diplomatic channels, and deny that the two were linked. The White House announced in January that the U.S. would pay Iran $400 million in the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the U.S. and Iran reached to resolve a legal dispute over the failed arms deal. Administration officials did not disclose at the time that the $400 million had already been paid in cash to Iran and refused to answer questions about how and when the payment took place. The administration stated that the legal dispute could have cost the U.S. some $10 billion without January's settlement.",
    " Title: Fox News' Tucker Carlson Faces Criticism for Denying Existence of White Supremacy Problem in America\n\nArticle:\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson is facing criticism for his claim that America's white supremacy problem is a \"hoax.\" In a monologue on Tuesday, Carlson dismissed the threat, stating it is \"not a real problem in America.\"\n\nThis statement came after the El Paso shooting, where the suspect's racist views and potential radicalization factors were under scrutiny. News outlets have pointed out that the anti-immigrant language in the manifesto published before the attack mirrors language often used on far-right-wing talk shows and websites.\n\nCarlson's comments sparked widespread condemnation, including from his own colleague, liberal Fox News contributor Mo Elleithee, who tweeted, \"You know who else believes white supremacy is not a real problem? White supremacists.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) conducted an audit in 2017, finding that white supremacist murders in the US \"more than doubled,\" with far-right extremist groups and white supremacists responsible for 59% of all extremist-related fatalities in the US that year. They were responsible for 20% of these fatalities the year before.\n\nFar-right extremists are also responsible for most of the ideological killings in America in the last 10 years, according to data from the ADL, which tracks extremist activity. White supremacists are also actively recruiting new members, with white supremacist groups posting more propaganda on college campuses for the third year in a row.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray warned in July that domestic terrorism threats are on the rise, and the FBI takes white supremacist hate crimes \"extremely seriously.\"\n\nCarlson's punditry on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" frequently focuses on immigration and depicts immigrants as dangerous criminals. He rejects multiculturalism and portrays it as a threat to \"Western civilization.\"\n\nWashington Post reporter and CNN contributor Wesley Lowery stated on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources\" that \"white supremacy is the ideology that has killed more Americans than any other terroristic ideology in the history of America.\"\n\nIn the wake of the El Paso massacre, white supremacy is receiving renewed attention. The Los Angeles Times published an editorial on Wednesday titled, \"As the El Paso massacre showed once again, white supremacy is the poison in our well.\"\n\nAt the same time, discussions on MSNBC suggest there is \"no distance\" between the anti-immigration rhetoric in the El Paso shooter's manifesto and commentary from Fox News opinion hosts like Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Brian Kilmeade.\n\nIt is important to note that the Dayton shooter's extreme left-wing views are not being compared to the El Paso shooter's white supremacist views, as there is no evidence that the Dayton shooter's politics were a factor in his actions. This is a crucial distinction.",
    " Title: Tensions Escalate as Gowdy Urges DOJ to \"Finish It the Hell Up\" Amid Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated hearing on Thursday, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina criticized Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for the ongoing Russia collusion probe, urging the Department of Justice (DOJ) to \"finish it the hell up because this country is being torn apart.\" The hearing, held by the House Judiciary Committee, saw a series of tense exchanges between Republicans and the DOJ over the handling of the Russia probe and the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\n\nThe day's events were marked by a resolution approved by the House, insisting the DOJ comply with congressional subpoenas for documents related to the Russia case. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, referenced this resolution during the hearing, challenging Rosenstein over his compliance.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Gowdy expressed frustration over the protracted Russia investigation, suggesting that despite numerous charges against individuals tied to the Trump campaign, the investigation has not found evidence of presidential wrongdoing. \"We've seen the bias, we need to see the evidence,\" Gowdy said. \"If you have evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the Trump campaign, present it to the damn grand jury. If you have evidence that this president acted inappropriately, present it to the American people.\"\n\nRosenstein, who oversees the special counsel's Russia probe, sought to defuse tensions, vowing to hold wrongdoers accountable in the wake of the inspector general report and defending the response to congressional requests for documents related to the Russia investigation. However, he was grilled repeatedly by House Republicans over various issues, including the department's role in Trump campaign surveillance, alleged stonewalling of congressional document requests, and the damning watchdog report on FBI conduct during the Clinton email probe.\n\nRosenstein denied allegations from Jordan that he had FBI agent Peter Strzok avoid answering certain questions during a closed-door appearance before the committee the previous day. He also could not discuss classified information in an open setting when asked what the DOJ and FBI did to surveil the Trump campaign, including the reported work of an informant apparently in contact with members of that campaign in 2016.\n\nRosenstein further rebuffed GOP suggestions that he recuse himself from the Russia probe, repeatedly denying allegations first reported by Fox News that he once threatened to subpoena GOP committee members and declined to comment about his role in approving a surveillance application for a Trump adviser. Rosenstein would not say whether he read the application, but stressed he's \"confident\" about his conduct and sees it as \"highly, highly unlikely\" that the inspector general would find wrongdoing on his part as part of an ongoing review.\n\nThe hearing also addressed the DOJ inspector general's findings on the Clinton email case, with Rosenstein stating that it showed some FBI officials \"deviated from important principles.\" He added, \"We need to correct errors, hold wrongdoers accountable, and deter future violations.\"\n\nRosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray have been criticized for months by Republicans on Capitol Hill who have suggested that the agencies are stonewalling congressional committees' requests for documents related to the beginning of the Russia investigation. However, Democrats have pushed back against those requests, with Democratic leaders sending a letter to Rosenstein and Wray on Tuesday, expressing concern that the agencies are disclosing sensitive information.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department gave House Republicans some of the documents they sought related to the Russia investigation and the Clinton email probe after lawmakers threatened to hold officials in contempt of Congress for stonewalling requests.",
    " Title: House Republicans Plan to Attach GOP Priorities to Debt Ceiling Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have announced their intention to attach a list of Republican priorities to the upcoming debt ceiling bill, including a delay of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The bill is expected to include provisions for major tax reforms, changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, and measures such as the Keystone pipeline and increased offshore energy production.\n\nDuring a meeting on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner and other top leaders outlined a wish list of items they plan to attach to the debt ceiling legislation. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced on the House floor that the increase will also contain \"important pro-growth economic policies, health care and non-health care reforms in addition to a one-year delay in Obamacare.\"\n\nThe strategy aims to keep the Republican party united, following a week of internal disputes about the strategy to deal with the government funding bill. The goal is to focus on the debt ceiling fight and maintain a unified front among Republicans.\n\nThe debt ceiling bill is expected to include provisions for major tax reforms, changes to entitlement programs, and measures like the Keystone pipeline and increased offshore energy production. The bill will reportedly be modeled on a budget, but will not include specific changes to the tax code. Instead, it will give instructions to both the House and Senate to pass tax reform by a specific deadline.\n\nGOP aides declined to specify the changes to entitlement programs that will be included in the bill, but congressional Republicans have pushed for changes to the way Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, effectively lowering annual increases for Social Security recipients.\n\nThe measure will also include approval of the Keystone pipeline and increased offshore energy production, which GOP members argue would boost job creation. The bill will also reportedly include several provisions to roll back regulations on coal plants and other industries.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Senate Democrats have stated they will not negotiate on a measure to authorize additional borrowing authority for the Treasury Department, which is projected to run out sometime in October or early November. They argue that Congress should not risk the nation's credit limit with another down-to-the-wire brawl over major policy issues like health care and taxes.\n\nObama and Boehner spoke on Friday, an aide to the speaker said. The aide reported that the president called the speaker to say he would not negotiate with him on the debt limit. The aide also stated that the speaker was disappointed but told the president that the two chambers of Congress will chart the path ahead.\n\nHouse Republicans say Obama himself agreed to add other measures to reduce the deficit in the last major negotiation over the debt limit. However, Senate Democrats argue that delaying Obamacare for a year and rolling back Obama administration regulations are non-starters, and not the debate they want to have on a must-pass bill.\n\nThe strategy to attach a host of major policy items to the debt ceiling bill is designed to keep the Republican party unified, at least temporarily. However, the addition of controversial items to the bill only increases the threat of a default, and ensures that Capitol Hill will be tied up for the next several weeks, if not months, with partisan fighting that could ripple through the financial markets.",
    " Title: Michigan Poll Shows Democratic Frontrunners Leading Trump in Key 2020 Battleground State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll of Michigan voters, two Democratic presidential candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, are leading President Donald Trump by 12 percentage points if the election were to take place today. The poll, conducted by Lansing, Michigan-based Glengariff Group, shows 36% of likely voters in Michigan would vote for Trump, while 48% would vote for Biden and 44% would vote for Sanders.\n\nMichigan, which has not voted for a Republican as president since 1988, surprised political observers in 2016 by backing Trump and helping him secure the White House. Winning Michigan is crucial to Trump's reelection path, along with the states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which have similar voting patterns.\n\nThe survey of 600 Michigan voters was conducted by live phone interviews and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points. It was published by The Detroit News and local news station WDIV-TV.\n\nIn a separate poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in early May, Biden led Trump by 11 percentage points in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump's campaign has acknowledged the potential weakness in these states, which have significant manufacturing and agriculture sectors that have been affected by the president's trade wars. As Democrats must first navigate a crowded primary field before focusing on the general election, Republicans are optimistic they have time to invest in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and ultimately gain an advantage.\n\nThe Michigan poll also compared Trump against three other Democratic presidential hopefuls: South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. All three also outperformed Trump in the poll, although by smaller margins than Sanders and Biden.",
    " Title: Trump's Visit to Mississippi Civil Rights Museum Met with Protests from African-American Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump visited Mississippi on Saturday to attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, but his visit was met with protests from top African-American leaders who stayed away due to their disagreement with his policies and record on race relations.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump toured the museum and delivered brief remarks, paying tribute to African-Americans who fought against institutionalized racism, including Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist who was murdered outside his home in Jackson in 1963.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Trump said, \"We want our country to be a place where every child from every background can grow up free from fear, innocent of hatred and surrounded by love, opportunity, and hope.\"\n\nReferring to Evers and other civil rights leaders showcased in the museum, Trump stated, \"Today we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice. We pray for inspiration from their example.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged Evers' wife Myrlie and brother Charles in the audience.\n\nU.S. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, stated on Thursday that he would not go to the museum opening because of Trump's presence.\n\n\"President Trump's attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,\" Lewis said in a statement with Mississippi Democratic U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, who also declined to attend.\n\nThe two men also cited Trump's \"disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants, and National Football League players\" and said the president had shown disrespect to those who fought for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also took issue with Trump's attendance.\n\nHowever, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who is black and ran against Trump in the early 2016 Republican presidential primaries before dropping out, accompanied the president on his tour of the museum.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has had a complicated record on race relations. He was a leading proponent of the false theory that Democratic President Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States. Obama was born in Hawaii, a U.S. state.\n\nIn August, Trump unleashed a firestorm of criticism, including from Republicans and a top adviser in his administration, for saying that both left- and right-wing protesters were at fault for violence at a white supremacist-led rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one woman died.\n\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah said on Friday ahead of the visit that the civil rights movement was about fighting intolerance, hatred, and bigotry, and that Trump intended to honor the leaders of that struggle.\n\nThe White House called the decision by Lewis and Thompson not to attend \"unfortunate.\"\n\nTrump concluded his remarks by saying, \"Today we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice, and peace.\"",
    " Title: Nationwide School Walkout Against Gun Violence Marks Columbine Anniversary\n\nArticle:\n\nSchoolchildren across the United States participated in a nationwide walkout on Friday morning to demonstrate against gun violence, marking the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado. The event, known as the National School Walkout, was initiated by Connecticut high school student Lane Murdock following the Parkland shooting in Florida.\n\nIn an unrelated incident, a student at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida, was shot in the ankle before the walkout. Only one person, a 17-year-old student, was injured, and a suspect is in custody. The suspect was initially identified as a student, but authorities later clarified that he was not a current student at the school.\n\nStudents at Forest High School, which had planned an in-school \"civic demonstration\" instead of a walkout, were taken to a nearby church to meet their parents. Around 11:00 local time, officers responded to reports of a gunman at another school in Marion County, but later said those reports were false. All schools in the district were placed on \"Code Red\" lockdown as a precaution.\n\nThe goal of Friday's demonstration, which involved more than 2,000 schools, was to raise awareness of gun violence and to combat political inaction. Student Lane Murdock launched the National School Walkout campaign in the wake of the Parkland shooting in Florida. The protest started as a petition on the website change.org, with more than 250,000 people signing it.\n\nParticipants on Friday also held 13 seconds of silence, in honor of the 13 victims of the Columbine shooting. The sample walkout agenda from the campaign states that the students will not return to school but instead will \"make calls to their Senators' offices and flood social media with calls for reform.\"\n\nUS students already staged a national walkout on March 14, one month after 17 people were murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. One student in North Carolina, who was the lone protester in March, posted a selfie outside his school with dozens of classmates on Friday.\n\nOn April 20, 1999, two teenage students murdered 12 of their classmates and one teacher at Columbine High School before killing themselves. Twenty-four more people were injured in the attack, mostly by gunfire. As well as guns, the pair used nearly 100 explosive devices, including a bomb placed in the school's cafeteria that did not detonate.\n\nThe shooting caused a national outcry, leading to changes in police tactics and investigations into violent video games and bullying. Actors Robert DeNiro and Julianne Moore penned absence letters for students to explain why they were participating. Students who survived the Florida shooting have actively advocated for an end to gun violence, with many backing legislative changes to control the sale of guns.\n\nOn Thursday, students from the Colorado school district where Columbine High School is located held a \"Vote for Our Lives\" rally adjacent to the scene of the massacre. About 60 students from Parkland, Florida, attended, as well as students who survived a 2013 shooting at nearby Arapahoe High School.",
    " Title: North Korea Removes and Executes Former Second-in-Command Jang Song Thaek\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea's state media announced on Friday that Jang Song Thaek, a close ally and former mentor to leader Kim Jong Un, has been executed. The announcement comes after Pyongyang announced Jang's removal from all his posts due to allegations of corruption, drug use, gambling, womanizing, and leading a \"dissolute and depraved life.\"\n\nJang, considered the second most powerful official in North Korea, was instrumental in helping Kim Jong Un consolidate power following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, two years ago. Jang's execution is the latest in a series of personnel reshuffles conducted by Kim Jang in an apparent effort to bolster his power.\n\nReports suggest that one of Jang's aides has sought asylum in South Korea. The unidentified aide, who managed funds for Jang, is being protected by South Korean officials in a secret location in China, according to cable news network YTN and the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nJang was removed from all his posts and expelled from the ruling Workers' Party during a meeting of its politburo on Sunday, as reported by the North's official KCNA news agency. Kim Jong Un attended and \"guided\" the meeting, it said. North Korean state television showed a still photograph of Jang being hauled away by uniformed guards from a large conference hall as it reported on the politburo meeting.\n\nKim's uncle has also been airbrushed out of pictures and video footage, and experts say his name is no longer searchable on the KCNA database. \"Jang and his followers committed criminal acts baffling imagination and they did tremendous harm to our party and revolution,\" KCNA said, without specifying if Jang had been detained or charged with any crime.\n\nThe report did not refer to Jang's aide, whose defection, if confirmed, would be the most serious for North Korea in 15 years. The decision to remove Jang was widely reported in North Korea's media, including on the front page of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday, in contrast to the dismissal of officials in the past which were almost never reported.\n\nThe Rodong Sinmun carried a picture of what it said was the politburo meeting. Jang and Kim Kyong Hui, Jang's wife and aunt to the young leader, were among 17 politburo members. Neither could be seen in the photo. However, Kim's aunt, the daughter of the North's founding leader Kim Il Sung, was not in trouble, a source with close ties to Pyongyang told Reuters.\n\nLast week, a South Korean official said Jang was likely alive and in no immediate physical danger, as was his wife. South Korea's National Intelligence Service last week said it believed Jang had been relieved of his posts in November. It also said two of Jang's close associates were executed recently for corruption.\n\nPyongyang is undergoing its biggest leadership upheaval since the death in 2011 of former leader Kim Jong Il, the younger Kim's father. Among Jang's senior party and military posts, he was vice chairman of the country's top military body, the National Defense Commission. Jang had close ties to China and visited Beijing in 2012 on behalf of Kim. He was also head of the North Korean side of a joint project managing a special economic zone with Beijing.\n\nIn listing reasons why Jang was dismissed, KNCA said, \"Jang pretended to uphold the party and leader but was engrossed in such factional acts (such) as dreaming different dreams and involving himself in double-dealing behind the scene.\" \"Affected by the capitalist way of living, Jang committed irregularities and corruption and led a dissolute and depraved life,\" KNCA added.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press and Reuters was used in this report.",
    " Title: North Korea's Kim Jong Un Affirms Nuclear Deterrent, Promotes Sister and Key Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reaffirmed the country's nuclear weapons as a \"powerful deterrent\" that safeguards its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday. The statement came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that only one thing would work in dealing with the isolated nation.\n\nIn a speech to the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party on Saturday, Kim addressed the \"complicated international situation.\" He stated that North Korea's nuclear weapons are a \"powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,\" referring to the \"protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.\"\n\nRecent weeks have seen North Korea launch two missiles over Japan and conduct its sixth nuclear test. The country may be advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. According to a Russian lawmaker who recently visited Pyongyang, North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile.\n\nTrump has previously stated that the U.S. would \"totally destroy\" North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies. The situation, Kim Jong Un said in the speech, proves North Korea's policy of \"byungjin,\" meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy, is \"absolutely right.\"\n\nKim also noted that the national economy has grown despite escalating sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council to curb Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program. The meeting also handled personnel changes within North Korea's secretive and opaque ruling center of power, state media reported.\n\nKim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, was made an alternate member of the politburo, the top decision-making body over which Kim Jong Un presides. Her new position indicates the 28-year-old has become a replacement for Kim Jong Un's aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, who was a key decision-maker when former leader Kim Jong Il was alive.\n\nMichael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University's 38 North website, stated, \"It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family's power.\"\n\nIn January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong, along with other North Korean officials, over \"severe human rights abuses.\" Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim's banned rocket program, were also promoted.\n\nState media announced that several other high-ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.\n\n\"The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he's looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nNorth Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump \"President Evil\" in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to a full vote-carrying member of the politburo. Madden stated, \"Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea's top policy makers.\"\n\n\"Even if he has informal or off the record meetings, Ri's interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top,\" he said.",
    " Title: Trump Lowers Expectations Ahead of North Korea Summit as Negotiations Remain Stalled\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is one week away from his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and he is attempting to lower expectations in advance. The meeting, set to take place in Vietnam at the end of February, aims to strike a deal to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program, a goal that has proven challenging.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, both sides are at an impasse. The United States has demanded that North Korea offer a full, detailed list of its nuclear inventory before sanctions are lifted, while North Korea insists that sanctions should be lifted before it provides the full list and begins to downgrade its nuclear capabilities.\n\nIn an effort to manage expectations, Trump has used numerous public opportunities to downplay the urgency of the situation. On Tuesday, he told reporters in the Oval Office, \"We\u2019re in no rush whatsoever... As long as there\u2019s no testing, I\u2019m in no rush. If there\u2019s testing, that\u2019s another deal.\"\n\nExperts suggest that Trump's comments are not entirely accurate. North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017 or a missile test since November of that year, but it has a history of long gaps between tests. The country has completed six nuclear tests in total, only one of which took place during the Trump administration.\n\nFrank Aum, a North Korea expert at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, stated, \"This only reinforces the perception among some that Trump either doesn\u2019t understand the threat or is cynically approaching the North Korea issue from a political rather than security perspective.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that the Hanoi summit likely won't be the last time he meets with Kim, indicating that a comprehensive deal to end North Korea's nuclear program may not be reached next week. Trump did add that he believed Pyongyang would eventually dismantle its nuclear arsenal, however.\n\nAum suggests that Trump is creating negotiating leverage by giving the impression that he is not desperate to achieve North Korea's denuclearization. Trump's strategy appears to be one of patience, as he waits for North Korea to take steps towards denuclearization without testing its weapons.\n\nBridget Coggins, a North Korea expert at the University of California Santa Barbara, stated that \"quick denuclearization is impractical.\" Kim Jong Un believes that a credible nuclear program is essential for the survival of his regime, as it serves as a deterrent against invasion from the United States. Therefore, Kim has no incentive to give up his arsenal and expose himself to attack.\n\nThe four-part plan agreed upon by Trump and Kim in their first summit in Singapore includes establishing new US-North Korea relations, building a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, working towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.\n\nExperts suggest that the next meeting may focus more on relationship building rather than ending nuclear programs, as \"denuclearization\" is only mentioned in the third step of the plan. The first two steps are primarily about improving ties between the US, North Korea, and South Korea. There is also disagreement about what \"denuclearization\" means, with the US interpreting it as the end of North Korea's nuclear program, and North Korea interpreting it as the withdrawal of US protection from South Korea.\n\nIt is possible that Trump is signaling that, as long as North Korea does not test any more weapons, the US will commit to working through the four-step plan. The next meeting may be more about relationship building than ending nuclear programs. Coggins states, \"There isn\u2019t trust between the two governments and they\u2019re working to change the relationship, but the pressure for real substantive progress is there too.\"",

The S&P 500 index (SPX) rose 36.64 points, or 1.3%, to finish at 2,924.58, while the Nasdaq Composite Index (COMP) added 116.51 points, or 1.5%, to close at 7,973.39.\n\nThis week's rebound has significantly reduced month-to-date losses for the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow are down 1.9% and 1.55%, respectively, while the Nasdaq is off 2.5%. The S&P 500 and Dow are each less than 4% below all-time closing highs set in July, while the Nasdaq remains around 4.2% below its peak.\n\nA spokesman for China's commerce ministry was quoted in news reports as saying the country would not immediately respond to the latest round of tariff increases announced by President Donald Trump on Friday. The spokesman, Gao Feng, said, \"The question that should be discussed now is about removing the new tariffs to prevent escalation.\" He also mentioned that both sides were discussing a planned meeting next month of trade negotiators.\n\nDavid Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, stated in a note, \"The largely hopeful tones of the update from China has lifted market sentiment, and that sparked buying this morning.\" He added, \"U.S.-China relations have been volatile recently, but for now, there is a sense that things are heading in the right direction, and that has coaxed some traders back into the market.\"\n\nInvestors also considered a series of economic reports, including a revision of second-quarter GDP growth that showed the U.S. economy growing at a 2% annual rate rather than the previously reported 2.1%. The revised numbers also showed the U.S. consumer playing an even larger role in economic growth than before, as personal consumption accounted for 3.1 percentage points of growth, versus the initially reported 2.9.\n\nNew applications for jobless benefits rose by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 during the week ended Aug. 24, slightly above economist expectations of 214,000, according to a poll.\n\nStocks have pulled back in August in sometimes volatile trade as the U.S.-China trade war escalated with rounds of tit-for-tat tariff escalations and increasingly harsh rhetoric on both sides, which has also been blamed for heightening worries over the global economic outlook and stoking fears of a possible U.S. recession.\n\nAnalysts also pointed to the calendar as a reason for higher equity prices in recent days, as investors rebalance their portfolios heading into September. \"There's a lot of evidence of month-end book squaring, as a lot of the worst performing sectors month-to-date outperformed yesterday, despite the lack of a discernible positive catalyst,\" wrote Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report, in a Thursday note to clients.\n\nPending home sales fell by 2.5% in July, according to the National Association of Realtors, versus a decline of 0.3% expected by economists polled by \u2588\u2588\u2588. The July goods trade deficit shrunk to $72.3 billion from $74.2 billion a month earlier, lower than the $75 billion consensus.\n\nShares of Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY) tumbled 8% after the retailer reported second-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, though it beat earnings-per-share forecasts. Shares of Dollar General Corp. (DG) added 10.7% after the discount retailer handily beat analyst estimates for sales and profits in the second quarter, while raising its outlook for the full-year 2019.\n\nTech Data Corp.'s (TECD) stock rose 15.7% after reporting fiscal third-quarter results. Shares of Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) declined 1.9% after the retailer beat sales estimates for the second quarter but fell short of profit expectations and issued full-year earnings guidance below analyst forecasts.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (TMUBMUSD10Y) rose 3.5 basis points to 1.5%. In commodities markets, the price of crude oil (US: CLV19) rose 1.3% to $56.52 per barrel, while the price of gold (GCZ19) ended the day 0.9% lower at $1,534.6 per ounce.

    " Title: Senate Leaders Reach Agreement to Vote on Bipartisan Bills to End Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have reached an agreement to vote on two bills aimed at ending the ongoing government shutdown on Thursday. One bill will be the immigration proposal President Donald Trump unveiled on Saturday, while the other is a clean continuing resolution that would reopen the government until February 8.\n\nThe clean continuing resolution, which the House has already passed, would be a viable option for Democrats, ensuring federal workers would not miss another payday. The immigration proposal, however, is considered a non-starter for Democrats due to its controversial provisions. The bill would need 60 votes to advance.\n\nThe outcome of this week's vote could mark a breakthrough in ending the shutdown, or it may represent another round of negotiations in the ongoing shutdown saga. If the short-term bill passes with enough Republican support, President Trump would receive a bill to fund the government without any wall funding, which would be a significant victory for Democrats. Conversely, if Trump opposes the proposal and discourages Senate Republicans from voting for it, the shutdown may continue.\n\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell requested the president to develop compromise legislation, as he needed something to present on the Senate floor. Additionally, centrist Democrats in the House, representing red or purple districts, have urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to at least promise the president a vote on his homeland security request, including border wall funding, after the government reopens.\n\nAlthough the Senate may not be able to end the shutdown on Thursday, the machinery necessary to eventually resolve the impasse is now in motion. The pressure from anxious Senate Republicans and anxious House Democrats is starting to build, signaling potential progress in ending the government shutdown.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Manager Accused of Obstruction in House Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated hearing on Tuesday, Corey Lewandowski, a close ally of President Donald Trump, was accused of obstructing information during a House Judiciary Committee hearing regarding the Russia investigation. The hearing, which marked the beginning of an \"aggressive series\" of impeachment hearings, saw Lewandowski confirm that the president had asked him to intervene in the Russia investigation.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler criticized Lewandowski's behavior, stating, \"It is a part of a pattern by a White House desperate not to reveal the truth.\" Nadler added, \"The president's lawyers are sitting behind you right now to make sure that you do not answer us.\"\n\nLewandowski, who is considering running for the US Senate in New Hampshire, followed White House orders not to discuss conversations with the president beyond what was already public in the former special counsel Robert Mueller's report. During the five-hour session, Lewandowski was defiant, demanding a copy of the Mueller report and reading from it.\n\nThe hearing was marked by a series of procedural votes initiated by Republicans, causing disarray. During a bathroom break, Lewandowski took the opportunity to tweet a link to his new Super Pac. Trump praised Lewandowski's testimony, tweeting that his opening statement was \"beautiful.\"\n\nThe hearing highlighted a central dilemma for the Judiciary Committee all year as it investigates and potentially tries to impeach Trump. Democrats have been pressured by their base to move quickly to remove Trump from office, but the White House has blocked the committee's oversight requests at almost every turn, declining to provide new documents or allow aides and associates to testify.\n\nLewandowski was a central figure in Mueller's report, which described two episodes in which Trump asked Lewandowski to tell the former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail Mueller's investigation and fire Sessions if he refused to meet with Lewandowski. Lewandowski never delivered the message, instead delegating the task to the White House aide Rick Dearborn, who declined to comply, according to the report.\n\nUnder questioning, Lewandowski acknowledged he might have lied in a cable interview when he said he didn't remember the president asking him to get involved with Sessions. He stated, \"I have no obligation to be honest with the media because they are just as dishonest as everybody else.\"\n\nTwo other witnesses who were subpoenaed alongside Lewandowski, Dearborn and the former White House aide Rob Porter, did not appear, on orders from the White House. Democrats are challenging the White House's position in court, arguing that former aides are not \"absolutely immune\" from testifying.",

    " Title: Senate's Vote on Patriot Act Provisions Results in Program's Temporary Expiration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe federal government's controversial program for gathering Americans' phone records expired at midnight on Sunday, marking a significant setback for the program's advocates, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul, who has made ending the data gathering program his signature issue. The expiration of the program and other anti-terrorism surveillance provisions under the Patriot Act was expected to be only temporary, but it represents McConnell's first serious defeat as majority leader.\n\nIn the wee hours of May 24 and again in an unusual Senate session on Sunday, Paul used parliamentary rules to disrupt floor action on the issue. A vote on a House compromise known as the USA Freedom Act is not expected until later this week. The House bill passed overwhelmingly and has President Obama's support. It leaves the job of data gathering to phone companies rather than the government, and requires the government to get a search warrant to access it.\n\nMcConnell worked hard to build opposition to the House bill, which he has criticized as a hurdle to intelligence gathering. However, he lost supporters as senators coalesced around the House bill, 77 to 17, in a procedural vote to advance the bill on Sunday. The leader had wanted to simply extend the provisions of the Patriot Act, but Paul, eight days ago and on Sunday, blocked even short-term extensions.\n\nRepublicans blamed Paul rather than the leader for the expiration. \"I'm sure we're not going to let the whole program lapse, but because Senator Paul is taking advantage of the rules of the Senate, [we] will delay and there will be an interim period where the nation is less secure,\" said Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona, on Sunday.\n\nDemocrats see things differently. Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada faulted McConnell, blaming him for a \"manufactured crisis\" by waiting to bring up the Patriot Act provisions until just before the Senate's Memorial Day recess\u2014a week before their expiration. When he was majority leader, Reid also used deadlines to forge consensus. However, Reid \"would never have stacked this many bills together against a deadline without a clear path forward,\" his spokesman, Adam Jentleson, said in an email.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine expressed concern about the program's expiration, stating, \"It's difficult to know...Perhaps we should have stayed in last week rather than going on recess until the issue was resolved.\" However, she also noted that when McConnell offered short-term extensions to work out compromise legislation just before the recess, \"I don't think it was anticipated\" that Paul and some Democratic allies would object.\n\nNow, she said, \"all of us are extremely concerned about the program going dark at a time when the terrorist threat is very high and coming at us from so many different directions.\"",
    " Title: Indian Detainees in Assam Fear Coronavirus Outbreak in Overcrowded Detention Centers\n\n Article:\n\n In the northeastern state of Assam, India, families of more than 800 undocumented migrants being held indefinitely in six detention centers are worried about the safety of their loved ones amid the global coronavirus pandemic. One such family is that of Gulbahar Begum, a 28-year-old woman from Marigaon district, who travels nearly 145km to Tezpur detention center to meet her 69-year-old father, Gul Mohammad.\n\n Mohammad, declared an \"illegal immigrant\" by the Foreigners Tribunal, a quasi-judicial court in Assam, has been in jail since 2017 due to insufficient documents to prove his citizenship. Over the past three weeks, Gulbahar has been waging a legal battle to free her father. She is concerned about his health, as he has various health issues, including a kidney ailment, and his left leg often swells up.\n\n The National Register of Citizens (NRC), which was published last year, left nearly 1.9 million people, many of them Muslims, stateless. They face either deportation or detention in camps such as the one in which Mohammad is detained. Several rights organizations have accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of using the NRC as a tool to target and disenfranchise the Muslim population, an allegation the Hindu nationalist party denies.\n\n Family members of those detained fear a potential coronavirus outbreak due to overcrowding in the detention centers, which makes physical distancing nearly impossible. Most centers lack proper hygiene and medical care for the detainees, exacerbating the chances of a viral transmission.\n\n Botu Miya, a 40-year-old man from Cachar district, is distressed as he fears his wife, Banesa Begum, being held in Silchar detention center, might contract the coronavirus. Banesa, a 45-year-old daily wage laborer, was first marked as a \"doubtful voter\" for not producing the requisite proof of Indian citizenship and later labeled an undocumented migrant.\n\n Since 1997, nearly 143,000 people have been marked as \"doubtful voters\" (or D-voters) in Assam, and their voting rights were taken away by the government. These individuals were referred to Foreigners' Tribunals, facing charges of being \"undocumented\" migrants mainly from Bangladesh. Some of them are currently languishing in detention centers.\n\n Manvendra Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of Sonitpur district, however, said all necessary measures were in place to ensure the safety of every inmate. \"We have stopped taking in new inmates. Everyone is being screened by the doctors on a regular basis, and there does not seem to be any such possibility of a coronavirus outbreak,\" Singh told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n Some families are making desperate attempts to secure bail from the courts before the virus turns into a disaster inside the detention centers. Anura Begum, a 31-year-old woman from Gobradhana village in Baksa district, has collected all the documents, including the bond amount to bail out her husband, Kadam Ali, lodged in the Goalpara center. However, courts across the state suspended functioning last month following the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n \"Just before the lockdown, I had submitted documents for his bail. The officials rejected them and asked me to furnish additional documents,\" Begum told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"But now courts are closed, and I don't know what will happen to him.\"\n\n Similarly, Hazrat Ali, a 22-year-old man from Shaatbhoridhuk village in Barpeta district, is also waiting for the courts to open so that he can get his father, Hanif Ali, out on bail. \"Each passing day brings new tragedy for us. All I want is him to be home,\" Ali told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n Human rights organizations have demanded the release of the detainees amid the escalating coronavirus pandemic. Amnesty International India, in a statement on Monday, called for the immediate release of inmates declared foreigners. \"Assam government must recognize that the detainees in overcrowded detention centers face a heightened risk of infection and must do everything to protect them, starting with their immediate release,\" Amnesty's executive director Avinash Kumar said in the statement.\n\n On Tuesday, India's Supreme Court heard a petition filed by one of the detainees, Raju Bala Das, and issued notices to both the Assam and federal governments. Das's petition had sought the release of people who have spent more than two years in detention. The top court also heard pleas by the Justice and Liberty Initiative, a non-profit group, which called for their release on humanitarian grounds.\n\n \"The government has deported just five 'foreigners' in the last seven years. It is because of the fact that most of those in the camps are Indian citizens. They should be immediately released,\" the group's founder Aman Wadud told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"And this is the best time to correct the historical mistake.\"\n\n The Supreme Court will next hear both the pleas on April 13. For Gulbahar, imprisonment amid the coronavirus pandemic is like a death sentence for her father. With each passing day, she says her hope of seeing him alive is fading. \"I think I would never see him alive,\" she said. \"And the government has to take responsibility for his death.\"",
    " Title: Trump Condemns Syrian Chemical Attack, Signals Potential U.S. Response\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has condemned the chemical attack in Syria that has been attributed to President Bashar Assad, signaling a shift in Trump's approach towards the Syrian leader. During a Rose Garden news conference on Wednesday with Jordan's King Abdullah, Trump stated, \"It crossed a lot of lines for me.\"\n\nThe attack, which has reportedly resulted in at least 72 deaths, has had a significant impact on Trump's stance towards Syria, according to the president. \"It's very, very possible that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's criticism of the Obama administration's approach towards Syria was reiterated during the conference, with the president stating that the attack had a \"big impact\" on him. However, when pressed on how the U.S. would respond, Trump remained vague, stating he did not want to reveal his hand and would remain flexible.\n\nTrump's comments on the Syrian conflict have been at odds with his past statements, as he previously argued the U.S. should not involve itself in the conflict. NPR's Tamara Keith reported on Tuesday that Trump's blame of former President Barack Obama for not acting after Assad crossed the \"red line\" was inconsistent with Trump's previous positions.\n\nTrump also criticized the Obama administration's approach to the Syrian conflict, stating, \"I think the Obama administration had a responsibility to solve the crisis a long time ago.\" He added, \"And when he did not cross that line in making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat.\"\n\nUnited Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley also suggested the possibility of U.S. intervention in Syria's ongoing civil war, strongly condemning the attacks and blaming Russia for its support of the Assad regime. Haley questioned, \"How many more children have to die before Russia cares?\"\n\nTrump has historically praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a willingness to collaborate with Russia in combating terrorism amid ongoing investigations into Russian efforts to influence the U.S. election last year and potential ties between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. In an interview with the New York Times before the news conference, Trump began to cast blame towards Putin, marking another shift in his stance. \"I think it's a very sad day for Russia because they're aligned, and in this case, all information points to Syria that they did this,\" Trump told the Times. \"Why they did this, who knows? That's a level, first of all, they were not supposed to have this.\"",
    " Title: Small Business Health Exchanges Face Challenges in Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is facing challenges in implementing the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchanges, a key component of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The exchanges, designed to make it easier for small businesses to purchase health coverage, are facing issues with insurer participation, particularly in some states.\n\nAccording to Politico, early looks at insurance offerings on the Obamacare exchanges show that insurers are not signing up in large numbers to sell on the SHOP exchanges. In some states, only one insurer has signed up for the SHOP exchanges, which are supposed to foster competition and make it easier for small businesses to purchase coverage.\n\nThe Obama administration is still trying to recruit insurers to states where there has been little interest in the exchanges. However, some health law advocates believe that the administration has prioritized standing up the individual exchanges, where they hope premium tax credits will be a big draw for millions to sign up for coverage next year.\n\nIn Washington state and North Carolina, for instance, only a single insurer has signed up to offer insurance through the small-business exchanges. In Mississippi, no insurers have signed up for the SHOP exchange, while only one insurer has signed up for their individual exchange.\n\nFurthermore, a delayed program that was supposed to help provide small-business employees with a greater array of choice in health plans isn't expected to get out of the gate until after 2015 in the federally-run state exchanges. This delay will not help the Obama administration follow through on the key selling point that these exchanges would be helpful to small businesses in increasing competition and lowering costs.",
    " Title: USA Freedom Act Clears House Judiciary Committee, Faces Uncertain Future in Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe USA Freedom Act, a bipartisan legislation sponsored by an unusual coalition of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, has passed the House Judiciary Committee with overwhelming support from both parties. The bill, which is expected to be approved by the full House, aims to reform the government's bulk data collection practices, particularly those authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\n\nThe measure faces a more uncertain future in the Senate, where a similar bill failed by two votes to overcome a filibuster last year. The legal authority for domestic bulk data collection is set to expire on June 1, creating a deadline that is likely to prompt Congress to take action to avoid letting the program disappear altogether.\n\nThe bulk collection program, revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013, generated significant criticism due to its wide-reaching data collection methods. Under the program, major phone companies were forced, under a secret court order, to pour their data directly into government computers. However, the data received was only \"metadata\" - phone numbers called, as well as the duration and time of calls, but not the content of the conversations.\n\nUnder the new legislation, the government would no longer be allowed to maintain a database of that information. Instead, they would be limited to obtaining data from telecommunications companies when there is a \"reasonable, articulable suspicion\" that a \"specific selection term\" used to request data is associated with international terrorism.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties advocacy group, the bill \"should end\" the bulk collection of \"everyone's phone records.\" However, the NSA could still search for records beyond telephone data with fewer restrictions. The bill would not address warrantless collection of Americans' international calls and emails under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments of 2008.\n\nThe future of the bulk collection program may have been sealed in December 2013, when a panel of experts appointed by President Obama found that the program had been of minimal intelligence value and ran considerable risks of invading privacy.",
    " Title: Terrorist Attack at Berlin Christmas Market Kills 12, Injures 48\n\nArticle:\n\nA suspected terrorist drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday night, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals and injuries to 48 others, some critically. The incident occurred at the popular Christkindlmarkt, or Christmas market, which has historical roots dating back to 1434 in Dresden's Striezelmarkt.\n\nThe attack has struck at the heart of German tradition, with the Christmas market symbolizing a powerful influence on German sentiment. Despite being dismissed as kitschy by some and overly commercial in some instances, the Christmas market remains a cherished part of German culture, characterized by twinkling white lights, a capella music, and wooden ornaments handcrafted by local artisans.\n\nIn an interview three years ago, a vendor named Roland Schweizer, who sold iced gingerbread cookies and sugared almonds at a Christmas market in Stuttgart, expressed the sentiment shared by many Germans: \"Without the Christmas market, there is no Christmas. This is worth preserving.\"\n\nBerlin police tweeted early Tuesday that the truck driver intentionally veered into the crowd, in what is believed to be a terrorist attack. The evening attack occurred at Breitscheidplatz, near the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church that lay in ruins after World War II.\n\nGermany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere stated that the man they arrested in connection to the attack is from Pakistan and entered Germany on December 31, 2015, coming to Berlin in February. It is possible he entered the country as part of a wave of more than a million refugees and migrants seeking asylum in Europe. However, Berlin police say the suspect denies any role, and they urge Germans to remain vigilant as the perpetrator may still be at large.\n\nThe attack follows a turbulent year for Europe, with the terrorist attack in Nice, France, in July, where a man drove a 19-ton truck into a crowd gathering for a fireworks display on Bastille Day, resulting in 86 deaths. Germany had been spared such a large-scale attack, although four separate incidents this summer became known as \"black July.\"\n\nThe yearning for a calmer time is powerful, and the allure of the Christmas market reflects this longing. Stephen Nissenbaum, author of \"The Battle for Christmas,\" told the Associated Press that this type of longing has always underpinned the \"Christmas spirit.\" People have always looked back at the magical hold Christmas had over them as children or generally to a time they perceive as simpler.\n\nOne longtime producer of Christmas markets in Germany could not be reached for comment. Hitting a Christmas market is powerfully symbolic for Germans, just as attacking Bastille Day festivities was for the French or hitting cafes for Parisians, as terrorists did on November 13, 2015.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Bernard Huyghe, a senior researcher at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs in Paris, states that terrorists, although it has not been confirmed in this case who is behind the attack in Berlin, are not necessarily hitting these places as symbols of a nation. \"They want to kill as many people as they can. It is very logical that they would choose very crowded places when people are celebrating, like Bastille Day or Christmas, or it could be football or a rock concert,\" he says.\n\nTerrorists have also targeted religion in Europe, killing a priest in Normandy this summer and targeting a kosher supermarket in Paris in January 2015. An attack on Christmas is perceived not in overtly religious terms but as an attack on a way of life. Millions are drawn to Germany's markets each year, so popular they are now reproduced around Europe and even the United States.\n\nThe US State Department issued a warning in November that terrorists in Europe were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events, including outdoor markets.\" Last week, officials said a 12-year-old boy attempted to set off a bomb at another market in Ludwigshafen. Markets in Germany have been shut down for the day out of respect for the victims, but are expected to reopen for the rest of the season under much heavier security \u2013 in Germany, France, and beyond.",
    " Title: Trump Delays Decision on Firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions Until After November Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has postponed his decision regarding the dismissal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions until at least after the November congressional elections, according to a statement made by Trump in an interview with Bloomberg News on Thursday. Trump expressed his desire for Sessions to perform well in his current position, but declined to comment on whether he would keep Sessions beyond November.\n\nTrump has publicly criticized Sessions for months, and reportedly told one Republican lawmaker that he wanted to fire him before the midterm elections. However, top Republican lawmakers have urged Sessions to resist pressure to resign and have encouraged Trump to hold off on any decision for the time being.\n\nTrump's statement on Sessions came after the president consulted advisers earlier this week about the potential political backlash from firing Sessions. Trump reportedly told one person that he did not believe there would be significant backlash. Inside the White House, senior officials provided Trump with legal and political reasons for not removing Sessions, but advisers were unsure earlier this week about Trump's ultimate decision.\n\nOne factor contributing to Trump's decision to keep Sessions for the coming months is the lack of a clear replacement. White House officials and others Trump has spoken to about firing Sessions said the president has not inquired about potential successors.\n\nTensions between Trump and Sessions have escalated due to Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. This investigation is examining possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as possible obstruction of justice. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has called the probe a \"witch hunt.\" Russia has also denied any involvement.\n\nLast week, Trump issued a series of attacks on Sessions, suggesting that Sessions is allowing the special counsel's Russia investigation to proceed while permitting \"real corruption\" to go \"untouched.\" In response, Sessions issued a rare public statement defending his leadership of the Justice Department. \"While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,\" he said.\n\nThe tweets put renewed pressure on Sessions, who is in a delicate position of both fending off attacks from Trump while implementing the president's tough-on-crime policies.",
    " Title: AP Photo of Mitt Romney Sparks Controversy Over Journalistic Ethics\n\nArticle:\n\nA photograph of Mitt Romney, a seemingly astonished schoolgirl standing behind him, has sparked a debate over journalistic ethics following its publication by The Associated Press (AP) on Monday. The image, which has since circulated widely on the internet, has been the subject of criticism for its perceived humorous and potentially disrespectful portrayal of the Republican presidential candidate.\n\nSteve Manuel, senior lecturer at Penn State's College of Communications and an award-winning photojournalist, stated that the AP must have been aware of the image's potential perception when it was published. \"In this photo, while it may appear funny, AP knows exactly what viewers are thinking,\" he wrote in an email. \"It's not legitimate news. AP knows that viewers are going to chuckle and imagine what the little girl is seeing, and it makes Gov. Romney appear a bit foolish. That is not the purpose or mission of photojournalism.\"\n\nTim Graham, media analysis director at the Media Research Center, shared similar sentiments, stating, \"It's unbelievable. It honestly looks like a little girl is gaping at Romney from behind.\" He further noted that the image coincided with a story with a decidedly anti-Romney tone.\n\nThe AP piece, which ran concurrently with the photograph, focused on Romney's decision to skip a Nickelodeon-sponsored \"Kids Pick the President\" special, an event that President Obama had agreed to participate in. The story was largely a platform for show producer Linda Ellerbee to express her disapproval of the Republican nominee.\n\nStephen Ward, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted that the photo, in itself, was not particularly offensive but could be exploited. He suggested that the AP may have entered a \"gray area\" with this image, as it was not altered or manipulated in any apparent way. However, the National Press Photographers Association code of ethics offers guidance, stating, \"Treat all subjects with respect and dignity\" and \"Be complete and provide context when photographing or recording subjects.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the photograph has raised questions about the role of journalism in political campaigns and the ethical implications of publishing images that may be perceived as disrespectful or humorous at the expense of a political candidate.",
    " Title: Trump Discusses Republican Leaders' Endorsement and Party Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has expressed confidence that he will receive the support of most Republican leaders despite some refusal to endorse him. Trump stated, \"I'm going to get millions and millions of votes more than the Republicans would have gotten,\" during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nTrump's comments come as House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday, has expressed doubts about Trump's conservatism, leading to his reluctance to endorse the nominee-in-waiting. In an interview on ABC's This Week, Trump described himself as a \"very different\" kind of candidate, suggesting that party unity may not be as crucial due to new Republicans.\n\nTraditional party unity has been a topic of discussion, with some Republican leaders, including 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, former 2016 GOP hopefuls Jeb Bush, and Lindsey Graham, expressing doubts about Trump's temperament, conservatism, and comments about women and Hispanics.\n\nTrump's critics have been vocal in their opposition. Bush, in a Facebook post on Friday, stated that Trump lacks \"temperament or strength of character\" to be president, and that he has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. Romney has denounced Trump as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud,\" while Graham has expressed skepticism about finding a conservative agenda with Trump.\n\nIn response, Trump has accused Romney of being \"ungrateful\" for his support in 2012, suggesting that Romney \"choked\" on his chance to beat President Obama. Trump also noted that Bush and Graham are upset that he beat them during the nomination fight, and that they have broken their pledge to support the nominee.\n\nTrump has also been critical of Ryan, stating that he was \"blindsided\" by Ryan's reluctance to endorse. Ryan, however, has expressed a desire to back the nominee but is not yet ready to do so.\n\nDemocrats, particularly Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, are reportedly enjoying the Republican in-fighting. Clinton told CBS' Face the Nation that she is reaching out to voters who want a candidate running on issues. Trump, on the other hand, is confident that most Republicans will back his candidacy, stating, \"The party's come together. I have tremendous numbers of endorsements.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community to Brief President-elect Trump on Russian Hacking Report\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is expected to receive a briefing on Friday regarding a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community on Russian hacking activities during the presidential election. The report, which was ordered by President Obama in December, has been prepared by the CIA, FBI, and NSA. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced on Thursday that an unclassified version of the report will be made public early next week.\n\nIn his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Clapper previewed some of the report's findings, stating that hacking was only part of Russia's cyber activities during the election. He also mentioned that classical propaganda, disinformation, and fake news were also involved.\n\nFour intelligence chiefs, including Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, will brief Mr. Trump on the report on Friday at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nFor several weeks, the president-elect has questioned the U.S. intelligence community's integrity and its assessment that Russia not only launched cyberattacks against the U.S. to sow doubt in the election but to sway the outcome in favor of Mr. Trump. Since the final weeks of the campaign, he has also doubted that Russia was responsible for the cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC), other political groups, and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump posted a tweet indicating he is still not convinced Russia is to blame for the cyberattacks against the DNC, other political groups, and John Podesta. He claimed on New Year's Eve that he had information no one else had on Russian hacking and that he would reveal it publicly this week, but he has not yet followed through on that statement.\n\nA number of Republicans in Congress, such as Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, are adamant about the need for the new administration to develop a more clear-cut cyber policy and to punish Russia for its actions. McCaul expressed confidence in the intelligence on Thursday, stating that the evidence he was briefed on in both classified and unclassified settings \"was very clear,\" and he said that it was clear the attacks were \"nation-state based.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and other Republicans warned at his committee's hearing that Russia must suffer the consequences. \"Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attacks on our nation,\" said McCain. Later in the day, he told reporters that the Trump administration should work with Congress to craft a cyber policy.\n\nClapper, Rogers, and undersecretary of defense for intelligence, Marcel Lettre, issued a joint statement on Thursday, warning that Russia is a \"full-scope cyber actor.\" They stated that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized the recent election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets. Russia has also used cyber tactics and techniques to seek to influence public opinion across Europe and Eurasia, they added.\n\nLast week, the Obama administration announced a new series of sanctions against Russian intelligence agents and entities that the U.S. says were responsible for hacks into the DNC and other servers. In addition to the targeted sanctions, 35 Russian operatives were expelled from the U.S. in retaliation.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said those actions weren't good enough and had some advice for the president-elect: \"When you listen to these people [in the intelligence community], you can be skeptical, but you have to understand they're the best among us.\"\n\n\"I think what Obama did was throw a pill. I'm ready to throw a rock,\" Graham said. \"If we don't throw rocks, we're going to make a huge mistake.\"\n\nOver the next week, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, plans to roll out legislation containing tougher sanctions against Russia.\n\n\"That hearing today gave a great boost to sanctions,\" McCain said. Clapper's testimony and Rogers' testimony this morning helps that process along and resolved any doubts as to what the intelligence part of our government thinks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump appeared to side this week with WikiLeaks' Julian Assange, who again denied that their source for hacked emails was not the Russian government. Several lawmakers slammed Mr. Trump for questioning the integrity of the intelligence community. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, asked Clapper, \"Who benefits from a president-elect trashing the intelligence community?\"\n\n\"I think there is an important distinction here between healthy skepticism,\" Clapper said. \"... I think there's a difference between skepticism and disparagement.\"\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, had positive, but qualified words for the intelligence community. \"I do have faith that our men and women in the intelligence community are doing an incredible job, sacrificing for our country,\" he told reporters Thursday. \"But there's always room for improvement.\"\n\nOn the question of whether Russians meddled in the presidential election, though, Ryan firmly believes the intelligence. \"Did the Russians hack us? Yes. Is it right for any country to meddle in our elections? No,\" he said on \"The Jerry Bader Show.\"",
    " Title: White House Honors Evangelical Leaders, Discusses Religious Freedom and Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unique turn of events, the White House hosted an evening celebration on Monday, not for a foreign head of state, but for evangelical leaders. President Donald Trump, in his address, acknowledged the gathering as a celebration of America's faith and its believers.\n\nAmong the faith leaders present were Rev. Franklin Graham and Pastor Paula White. The president also took a moment to express gratitude for the late Sen. John McCain's (R-AZ) service to the country.\n\n\"Our hearts and prayers are going to the family of Sen. John McCain... and we very much appreciate everything Sen. McCain has done for our country,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president then shifted the focus to the dinner's purpose: honoring America's faith and freedom. He emphasized his administration's efforts to combat religious persecution, citing the release of hostages from North Korea, including an American pastor, and the ongoing efforts to free Pastor Brunson from Turkey.\n\nTrump urged people of faith to vote in the midterms to continue the progress. This sentiment was echoed by Pastor Robert Jeffress, a staunch supporter of the president.\n\n\"They are facing the possibility of a Democrat Congress that, if they take control of the legislature, will either impeach this president from office or at least paralyze him while he is in office,\" Pastor Jeffress said.\n\nThe event served as a show of appreciation for the role evangelicals played in propelling Trump into office in 2016 and a pledge to protect their rights to continue their work.\n\n\"The support you've given me has been incredible, but I really don't feel guilty because I have given you a lot back,\" Trump said.\n\nRalph Reed, from the Faith & Freedom Coalition, weighed in, stating, \"The president just wanted to celebrate, and what our churches and houses of worship do every day \u2013 to provide spiritual direction to the lost, heal the broken-hearted, to save marriages and lives \u2013 that goes every day in America.\"",
    " Title: Lessons Learned: The Financial and Social Consequences of Public White Supremacy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe aftermath of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has highlighted the financial and social repercussions of publicly espousing white supremacist views. In the week following the event, several companies, including Cloudflare, have terminated their services for white supremacist websites, such as The Daily Stormer.\n\nIn a recent piece at National Review, Kevin Williamson discusses the ideology of white supremacists, suggesting that they lack a coherent set of demands or a well-developed ideological position, but are instead seeking identity and purpose in the wrong places. This theory reflects the experiences of the author, who grew up in a town where the Confederate flag was displayed casually and unabashedly.\n\nThe author recalls a high school classmate who identified as a neo-Nazi, but was unable to provide a cogent explanation for his prejudices. In the early 2000s, the author worked construction with a Klansman who struggled financially and showed up to job sites hungover. These individuals, the author notes, were born into less than ideal circumstances, but their circumstances were not orchestrated by people of color or other minority groups.\n\nIn May 2012, the FBI arrested some of the author's former high school classmates as they trained with American Front, a white supremacist group. The author expresses empathy for people of color who may have felt threatened by the group's activities in their community.\n\nDespite their public displays of white supremacy, the author argues that many of these individuals are simply sore losers, people who have not achieved their goals due to circumstances beyond their control. The author suggests that most people, regardless of their prejudices, understand the importance of caution and courtesy in order to succeed in society.\n\nThe author concludes by stating that the \"dapper\" echelons of the alt-right, with their education and supposed historical acumen, have also learned this valuable lesson: being awful in public will not lead them to the places they aspire to be.",

The vote has set in motion a series of events that could potentially lead to renegotiating the bailout terms or Greece's exit from the EU.\n\nEurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem described the vote as \"regrettable for the future of Greece,\" and called an emergency meeting on Tuesday. The European Union leaders expect Greece to put forth a new proposal soon.\n\nThe first concrete consequence of the vote was the resignation of Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis on Monday. In a statement, Varoufakis expressed hope that his resignation would aid Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in negotiating more favorable terms for Greece.\n\nVaroufakis, who called the vote \"splendid\" and the \"historic\" moment when Greece \"rose up against debt bondage,\" also indicated that he would wear the creditors' loathing with pride.\n\nGreece has appointed Euclid Tsakalotos as its new finance minister. Tsakalotos, who has been a key negotiator in the drawn-out talks between the Greek government and creditors, is expected to maintain a more reserved public persona compared to Varoufakis, but may not take a softer approach in substance during the new bailout talks.\n\nEuropean Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that while they respect the \"democratic choice of the Greek people,\" the no vote \"widens the gap between Greece and Eurozone countries.\" He also explained that the European Commission cannot negotiate new terms with Greece without a mandate from eurogroup countries.\n\nDombrovskis emphasized that the eurozone is not in danger, and concluded that \"the place of Greece is, and remains, in Europe.\" He urged all sides to work together responsibly for the sake of the Greek people.",
    " Title: Mississippi Senate Candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith Attended Segregation Academy, Praised Confederate Soldier\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to a tense Senate runoff election in Mississippi, Republican candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith has faced renewed scrutiny over her past associations and comments. Reports from the Jackson Free Press, an independent newspaper in Mississippi, and CNN have brought attention to Hyde-Smith's attendance at a segregation academy and her praise for a Confederate soldier's efforts.\n\nThe Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith attended Lawrence County Academy, a school founded in 1970, the year many Mississippi public high schools integrated. The newspaper reported that the school was created for parents who did not want to send their children to schools with black students. The Free Press included photos from the school's yearbook, including a group photo of the cheerleading squad, of which Hyde-Smith was a member. The photo shows the school's mascot dressed in what appears to be a Confederate uniform holding a Confederate flag.\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign spokeswoman, Melissa Scallan, responded to the report, stating, \"In their latest attempt to help Mike Espy, the gotcha liberal media has taken leave of their senses. They have stooped to a new low, attacking her entire family and trying to destroy her personally instead of focusing on the clear differences on the issues between Cindy Hyde-Smith and her far-left opponent.\"\n\nAnother report, from CNN, delved into Hyde-Smith's work as a legislator and found she once praised a Confederate soldier for his work to \"defend his homeland.\" According to CNN, as a state senator in 2007, Hyde-Smith co-sponsored a resolution that honored Effie Lucille Nicholson Pharr, whose father was a soldier in Robert E. Lee's army. The resolution stated that her father \"fought to defend his homeland and contributed to the rebuilding of the country.\"\n\nDemocratic candidate Mike Espy has repeatedly pointed to Hyde-Smith's comments while campaigning. Hyde-Smith apologized for the \"hanging\" comments during a debate earlier this week and dubbed the voting suppression comments a \"joke.\" The continued reports have garnered national attention to the runoff race, which is expected to see a higher-than-average turnout. President Donald Trump is planning multiple rallies next week ahead of the election to help secure another Republican seat in the Senate after large losses in the House allowed Democrats to gain control.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Challenges in First Month as President\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is encountering significant obstacles in his first month in office, as the complexities of the Washington political landscape present hurdles that cannot be easily overcome by a business executive. The vast government machine, composed of courts, bureaucracy, and Congress, can emerge as a threat at any point.\n\nIn the past week, political pressure has led to the dismissal of Trump's national security adviser and the withdrawal of one of his Cabinet nominees. The president is also facing persistent and growing questions about his campaign's ties to Russia, with some fellow Republicans in Congress expressing concerns. Legislative victories are proving elusive as congressional Republicans struggle to unify behind policy measures, and Democrats form a solid bloc of opposition.\n\nThe transition from candidate to president is challenging for most young administrations. Presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton experienced rocky opening weeks as their campaign idealism collided with Washington reality. However, Trump's first month in office is noteworthy due to the self-inflicted wounds that have arisen, from the rushed rollout of his travel ban to his frequent Twitter distractions.\n\nThe turmoil surrounding the new administration could undermine a central tenet of Trump's pitch to voters: that he is a non-politician uniquely positioned to make deals and get Washington working again. Trump's inaugural speech in Cleveland stated, \"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.\"\n\nTrump began his presidency by adhering to these beliefs, unleashing a series of executive orders demonstrating a determination to wield firm executive power. However, the backlash was swift as the checks on presidential power soon activated. The federal court halted Trump's controversial executive order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. Despite GOP majorities in Congress, Trump is not making much progress on his legislative agenda.\n\nOpposition is growing in the Senate to paying for his border wall now that Mexico has refused to fund it, according to CNN's Manu Raju. Democrats have frustrated the President by delaying confirmation of Cabinet nominees.\n\n\"That's all they're doing is delaying,\" Trump said during an extraordinary White House press conference last week. \"And you look at (Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer and the mess that he's got over there, and they have nothing going.\"\n\nA leaky federal government and intelligence community with which Trump is locked in a perpetual state of war are also resisting his attempts to exert control over his administration. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus denied Sunday that there was dysfunction in the President's inner circle.\n\n\"The truth is that we do not have problems in the West Wing,\" Priebus said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"The amount of drama and spin that you read about mostly in the Washington daily gossip rags is unbelievable stuff. And it just is not true.\"\n\nAmid the negative headlines, Trump is attempting to speak directly to the American people. He delivered a speech Friday touting his jobs agenda at a Boeing factory in South Carolina and a campaign-style rally over the weekend in Florida. He is scheduled to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress later this month, providing one of the strongest venues available to project presidential strength.\n\nHowever, Trump's early stumbles have overshadowed some areas where he could otherwise claim success. Well-choreographed visits from the leaders of Britain, Israel, Canada, and Japan followed a host of executive orders that began to dismantle Obamacare and federal regulations and open the way for cross-continental pipelines, as well as Trump's withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. His unveiling of Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the open Supreme Court seat was one of the most flawless moments of his presidency.\n\nControversy can develop in unexpected directions in Washington and exhaust a White House staff in a way that can be detrimental to a presidency. Trump is not the first President to come into power with a team that does not seem to quite measure up to Washington's demands.\n\n\"I think every administration goes through that,\" said Trent Lott, a former Republican Senate Majority leader, in an interview. \"I was here through Carter, when a bunch of Georgians who thought they were the smartest guys in town arrived and they were going to fix everything.\"\n\n\"When (Ronald) Reagan came to town, he brought a bunch of Californians, idealistic ideologues who found out pretty quick that they needed help from Jim Baker,\" Lott said.\n\nThrough trial and error, Clinton and Reagan learned to work the inside game in Washington to advance what were sometimes seen as outsider political aims. However, Trump's attempts to fight back against the restrictions all presidents face could be complicated by another factor: his idiosyncratic character and political style, which were an undoubted asset when he reinvented the rules of the presidential campaign but have not yet proven effective in governing.\n\nHis constant feuds with enemies, sometimes on Twitter, cast doubt on his temperament, as do his unpredictable eruptions and struggles to stop gloating about his election win. His press conference and weekend rallies helped keep his loyal supporters happy and boosted his own morale. However, it seems unlikely that he meaningfully advanced his political agenda.\n\nGOP majorities on Capitol Hill should ensure that big-ticket issues like tax cuts and Wall Street reform get done and that Trump can bill them as the kind of \"wins\" he promised would dazzle Washington. And if any politician can get away with such polarizing tactics, it's Trump.\n\n\"The President's campaign essentially changed the laws of physics last year,\" said Bill Lacy, director of the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.\n\n\"All the so-called experts have been wrong consistently,\" Lacy said, adding that Trump had changed the way presidents are viewed along with the usual codes of behavior in the White House and Washington. \"Traditionally, a President could not do that and get away with it. With this president, that remains to be seen.\"",
    " Title: House GOP Blocks Immigration Measures on National Defense Authorization Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Republican leadership has formally blocked a pair of immigration-related measures from being voted on in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a critical defense policy bill, on early Wednesday. This latest development deals another blow to the prospects of immigration legislation this year.\n\nThe Republican-led House Rules Committee, which adheres to the wishes of leadership, declined to include the ENLIST Act, a bill authored by Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) that provides a path to green cards for immigrants who came to the U.S. as children if they serve in the military, among the amendments to be considered on the NDAA.\n\nRep. Denham expressed his disappointment over the decision, stating, \"I am disappointed that my ENLIST amendment was not ruled in order this year. I will continue to push for a vote on the stand-alone bill so that undocumented young people who want to perform the ultimate act of patriotism will have that opportunity and be able to earn legal status through their sacrifice.\"\n\nAnother immigration measure, from Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), that would allow young immigrants who have been granted a reprieve from deportations by the Obama administration to enroll in U.S. military academies was also blocked from a vote.\n\nRep. Castro expressed his disappointment in a statement, saying, \"I'm disappointed that expanding opportunity to all of our students to the U.S. military academies is not allowed to be part of the discussion about our nation's defense readiness.\" He plans to introduce the measure as a standalone bill with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.).\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) stated on Tuesday that including Rep. Denham's legislation, known as the ENLIST Act, on a must-pass bill such as the NDAA was \"inappropriate,\" although he noted that Republican leaders have supported the measure in the past. Boehner added that there are talks about allowing the bill to get a stand-alone vote on the House floor.\n\nMore than 300 amendments were filed to the NDAA, and 162 of them will be considered on the legislation, a sweeping annual measure that sets policy for the Pentagon.",
    " Title: U.S. Mission in Syria: A Shift from ISIS to Regime Change and Iran, and the Ongoing Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States' involvement in Syria has been marked by a shift in objectives, with the initial aim of defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) evolving into a focus on fighting Iran and promoting regime change in Damascus. The withdrawal of American troops from Syria has sparked confusion, with some viewing it as a necessary move to protect the Kurds from NATO ally Turkey, while others accuse President Donald Trump of handing a victory to Iran or giving a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe presence of a small American force of 4,000 troops in certain regions of Northern Syria is pursuing a limited objective, primarily focused on fighting ISIS. However, the mission's scope and objectives have been a subject of debate, with some viewing it as a modest endeavor, while others see it as a crucial component of the global liberal order.\n\nThe term \"mission creep\" has been used to describe the shift in military objectives that results in a long-term commitment. The U.S. mission in Syria, however, is mission creep itself, with objectives and rationale evolving over time. Initially, the focus was on supporting \"moderate\" Syrians in their civil war against the Assad regime, but this shifted as ISIS emerged in eastern Syria and western Iraq.\n\nThe U.S. has been accused of concocting elaborate theories about the codependence and cooperation of ISIS and the Assad regime. The Free Syrian Army, initially held out as a beacon of hope, quickly disintegrated, suggesting it was little more than a branding exercise.\n\nPublic support for greater U.S. involvement in Syria, driven by the beheadings of Americans and terror attacks across Europe, has provided a legal imprimatur for the U.S.'s actions under the 2001 Authorized Use of Military Force. However, the mission's objectives have often been at odds with the public-approved goal of defeating ISIS, as hawks and the foreign-policy establishment have sought to confront Shia governments in Damascus and Tehran.\n\nNew plans for American involvement in Syria have been proposed every six months or so, but they all share the same objective as the 2012 plan: defeating ISIS, toppling Assad, and hurting Iran. In 2015, Frederick Kagan suggested inserting 40,000 to 50,000 troops to create a safe zone in Syria, with the ultimate goal of forcing Assad out of power.\n\nIn 2018, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson outlined a way forward in Syria, with five key end states: reducing Iran's influence, creating conditions for refugees to return, ensuring Syria is free of weapons of mass destruction, transitioning away from Assad's leadership, and preventing the return of ISIS and al-Qaeda. Tillerson promised to achieve these goals with a minimum of troop commitments.\n\nHowever, many refugees have already returned to Syria as Assad recaptured territory, and the zones of conflict have changed. Strengthening long-lasting government authority seems to be the swiftest way to reduce the capacity of ISIS locally, rather than continuing low-grade war in ad hoc alliances with non-state actors.\n\nThe disparity between the mission the public approved\u2014defeating ISIS\u2014and the mission that Washington's interventionists wanted\u2014ousting Assad and hurting Iran\u2014lasted until Trump announced his policy. This explains the hollow arguments for staying in Syria now that the caliphate has been destroyed. Some, like my colleague David French, merely want to deny ISIS any safe haven. However, many hawks want to stay because they want more chances to make their case for regime change and anti-Iranian military action in Syria. Their mission was mission creep. Six years is enough.",
    " Title: Abortion Laws in New York and Alabama Spark Controversy: A Look at the New York and Alabama Abortion Laws and the Ongoing Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nProtests outside the Alabama State Capitol have been ongoing, demonstrating against the state's new abortion law, enacted on May 15, 2019. The controversy surrounding abortion laws has been a topic of discussion in the United States, with recent comments made by President Trump and other political figures.\n\nIn early January, Kathy Tran, a Democratic Virginia delegate, introduced legislation to liberalize abortion in her state. During a colloquy with a Republican lawmaker, Tran's bill would have legalized abortions through the 40th week of pregnancy, including during labor. Following backlash, Tran clarified that she misspoke, as this would have violated infanticide laws.\n\nIn response to Tran's bill, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist by training, explained that in cases where a fetus was not viable, the infant would be delivered, resuscitated if desired, and a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. Northam never said anything about \"executing\" babies, but his comments have been a point of contention.\n\nTran's bill didn't pass, but it was part of a trend in liberal states to loosen abortion laws even further. Earlier in January, Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had signed similar legislation. The media's response to New York's law was relatively muted, while the reaction to Alabama's law has been more intense.\n\nPolling on abortion is notoriously complex, with many Americans holding conflicting views on the issue. According to Gallup, 60 percent of Americans support abortion rights in the first trimester, but only 13 percent do in the third trimester.\n\nThe Alabama law, which is considered near-total, is unconstitutional under current precedent. The law's sponsors deliberately passed an unconstitutional law in the hope that the Supreme Court's new conservative majority would overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the landmark cases that established abortion rights in the United States.\n\nNew York's Democratic lawmakers weren't trying to test Roe or Casey, but to create a post-Roe abortion \"sanctuary\" in case the court does reverse Roe. The underlying political reality is that most Americans want a compromise, but the parties are more responsive to the activists and donors. As a result, Democrats have abandoned their \"safe, legal, and rare\" rhetoric, while Republicans are downplaying a \"culture of life.\"\n\nThe debate over abortion laws is a polarized and polarizing issue, with each party seeking to cast the other as extreme. Republicans highlight rare late-term abortions, while Democrats focus on the also-rare cases of 12-year-olds impregnated by their rapist fathers. Overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion might not defuse the political passion, but at some point, we are likely to find out.",
    " Title: Memorial Day Calls for National Unity Amidst COVID-19 Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant impact on the United States, leading to a surge in unemployment, business closures, and deaths. As the country commemorates Memorial Day, the need for national unity in response to this external threat has become more apparent.\n\nAccording to recent data, approximately 35 million people have filed for unemployment benefits, with millions more not accounted for. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses have closed, and major retailers like JC Penney and J. Crew are declaring bankruptcy. Manufacturing plants, such as Ford, have reopened only to close again due to worker infections. Major industries like the airlines are surviving primarily due to government and Federal Reserve assistance.\n\nThe human toll of the virus is substantial, with over 90,000 deaths and tens of thousands more weakened or crippled. However, the casualties extend beyond the virus's direct impact. Homeowners and renters struggle to pay mortgages and rent, graduates are unable to keep up with student loans, small businesses exhaust their reserves and lay off employees, front-line workers face constant stress and infection risk, and states and localities face plummeting revenues and rising costs, leading to layoffs and service cuts.\n\nPeople are understandably scared, worried, and angry due to dashed plans and hopes caused by the pandemic. At this time, as in wartime, the government must act to organize the collective response to the crisis, provide medical and protective gear, develop testing and tracing strategies, distribute health resources, and galvanize an all-out effort for a remedy. The government must also limit the damage, keeping families in their homes, small businesses open, and workers employed.\n\nRecent statements by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Lindsey Graham have raised concerns about the urgency to aid states and localities and extend supplemental unemployment benefits. McConnell has suggested that states could go bankrupt, and the crisis is largely due to \"blue-state\" mismanagement. Graham stated that any extension of unemployment benefits would occur only \"over our dead bodies.\"\n\nThe casualties are not partisan; they affect Republicans and Democrats, small business owners and small farmers, meat packers, and more. They disproportionately impact middle- and low-income families, the poor, the elderly, and the sick. They are found in red states and blue states.\n\nMcConnell acknowledges the non-partisan nature of the casualties and the response must be the same. Let us hope he uses this Memorial Day break to develop a response of the necessary scale to meet the crisis. Let us hope that he moves from obstruction to negotiation, figuring out the compromises needed to move legislation through the Senate.\n\nMost Americans agree that aiding the unemployed and supporting small business owners is not controversial. Some conservative Senate Republicans have joined with progressive House Democrats to champion a paycheck guarantee program that would support small business owners to pay their employees even when their businesses are locked down. This would enable workers to keep their benefits, get their pay, and owners to sustain their teams.\n\nThis is not a blue or red program; it is common sense. Similarly, most Americans would agree that everyone should have access to treatment and testing without financial worry, that the post office should not be bankrupted, and that voting should be safe in the fall. Voting by mail is not a partisan agenda; it is a safety agenda.\n\nThis is a time when leaders must emerge, move beyond their comfort zone, and offer bold responses to a stark crisis. This is not a moment for posturing; it is a time for patriotism, for solidarity, for action. Let us hope that Memorial Day celebrations may help our leaders remember this challenge.",
    " Title: Islamic State Launches Offensive on Ramadi, Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nIslamic State militants have launched a fierce attack on the city of Ramadi, located in the Sunni-dominated Anbar Province, 70 miles west of Baghdad. The assault marks a setback for the Iraqi military's ongoing offensive in the region.\n\nSunni tribal leaders, who have been holding out in the city, reportedly expressed their shortage of weapons and ammunition, and are under intense pressure from the extremist group, according to Sterling Jensen, an assistant professor at the United Arab Emirates' National Defense College in Abu Dhabi. Jensen maintains close contact with tribal leaders.\n\nIraqi Defense Ministry spokesman, Brig. Gen. Tahseen Ibrahim, acknowledged that the militants have gained a foothold in some areas of Anbar Province, as reported by the Associated Press. He stated that reinforcements have been dispatched to the province, and the situation is under control, with the standoff expected to be resolved in the coming hours.\n\nU.S. Central Command reported that the Iraqi government remains in control of Ramadi, the provincial capital. The fighting in Anbar is a key test for Iraq's military's goal to push the militants out of the country. Iraq's leaders decided to make a push in Anbar, located along the main roads linking Baghdad to the Syrian border, before launching an offensive into Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.\n\nSome residents of Anbar have sided with the Islamic State militants due to their shared Sunni identity and feelings of alienation from Iraq's Shiite-dominated government. Other tribes have fought against the militants, complaining of insufficient support from Baghdad's central government.\n\nWashington has encouraged the Iraqi government to provide the Sunni tribes with arms and other support to carry out the fight against the extremists. \"Baghdad is not speaking realistically about what's happening and what it claims to be doing for Sunni fighters,\" Jensen said.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi expressed concern on Wednesday about the conflict in Yemen, stating that his government is \"uneasy\" about U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia, which is carrying out airstrikes against Shiite rebels there. Al-Abadi told reporters the conflict \"has all the potential to become a sectarian war.\"",
    " Title: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Accuses President Trump of Coordinated Effort to Subvert 2016 Election, Questions Ties with Putin\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) did not back down from her attacks on President Donald Trump after they agreed to end the partial government shutdown, instead she hit him with a bizarre conspiracy theory. The Democratic leader made the accusations from her social media account on Friday.\n\n\"Roger Stone's indictment makes clear there was a deliberate, coordinated effort by top Trump campaign officials to subvert the will of the American people during the 2016 Election,\" she tweeted.\n\nPelosi was referring to the indictment and arrest Friday morning of one of the president's oldest friends and former campaign aides, Roger Stone. He was arrested at his home and charged with lying to Congress about being an intermediary between WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Trump campaign.\n\nPelosi then asked if Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin was extorting President Trump.\n\n\"@realDonaldTrump's continued efforts to undermine Special Counsel Mueller's investigation raises the questions: 'What does Putin have on @realDonaldTrump, politically, personally or financially?'\" she asked rhetorically.\n\nShe then implied that the president was attempting to weaken NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in order to help Putin's foreign policy schemes.\n\n\"Why has the Trump Administration continued to discuss pulling the U.S. out of NATO, which would be a massive victory for Putin?\"\n\nThe speculation that Trump is doing the bidding of Putin because of some compromising information held against him has been made by many of the most virulent of the president's critics. Trump has denied all allegations of this sort.\n\nPelosi added in a statement, \"Lying to Congress and witness tampering constitute grave crimes.\"\n\n\"All who commit these illegal acts should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\" she said. \"We can not allow any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from appearing before Congress.\"",
    " Title: Gun Violence Hearing: Tax Attorney Argues for Women's Right to Bear Arms for Self-Defense\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a Senate gun violence hearing on Tuesday, tax attorney Gayle Trotter, the sole female member of the five-person panel, advocated for women's right to own firearms for self-defense. Trotter argued that guns serve as an equalizer in violent situations, particularly for women facing larger, stronger male attackers.\n\n\"For women, the ability to arm ourselves for our protection is even more consequential than for men because guns are the great equalizer in a violent confrontation,\" Trotter stated. \"We protect women by safeguarding our Second Amendment rights. Every woman deserves a fighting chance.\"\n\nHowever, it is essential to clarify that Trotter's statement emphasizes the need for self-defense, not advocating for women to engage in combat.\n\nIn June, Trotter published an op-ed that appeared to criticize the idea of allowing women to serve in combat, but in reality, it questioned the role of women in the military in general. Trotter argued that young, single women recruited to serve in the military often become pregnant, which she suggested could disrupt their military service.\n\n\"Many young single women are specifically recruited to serve in our military,\" Trotter wrote. \"When you mix young women with fit young men, pregnancies are to be expected.\"\n\nTrotter further argued that a woman's role as a mother was more important than a position in the military. She questioned the principles of women's liberation, suggesting that confining mothers to leave their children behind while serving in the military would infringe upon their freedom.\n\n\"Do the principles of women's 'liberation' embrace jailing mothers for refusing to leave their kids behind with strangers?\" Trotter asked rhetorically. \"If a woman is not free to care for her child, what kind of liberation does she have?\"\n\nCritics seeking to maintain the ban on women in combat have argued that women are inherently less fit than their male counterparts. Trotter's testimony today echoed this argument, equating women with mothers.\n\n\"If we ban these types of assault weapons, you are putting women at a great disadvantage, more so than men, because they do not have the same type of physical strength and opportunity to defend themselves in a hand-to-hand struggle,\" Trotter told members of the Senate. \"And they're not criminals; they're moms. They're young women. And they're not used to violent confrontations.\"\n\nTrotter did not mention the biological or emotional problems former presidential candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich referenced in their arguments against women in combat.",
    " Title: Assaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents Reach Decade High in 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nAssaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and Border Patrol agents have seen a significant increase in recent years, according to government data. In 2017, the number of assaults on ICE agents and officers reached 48, tying the highest recorded since the beginning of the decade, while assaults on Border Patrol agents surged to 856, marking a decade high.\n\nThe report, released by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, indicates a renewed danger, particularly on the southwest border. The most frequent method of attack was projectiles, such as large rocks, which accounted for half of all assaults. Other weapons used include bombs, clubs, knives, guns, and laser pointers.\n\nMost injuries were minor and did not require treatment, the audit found. Customs and Border Protection recorded 1,089 assaults in 2010, which dropped through 2014, with just 381 assaults. However, the number of assaults began to rise again, reaching 856 in 2017.\n\nIn 2017, there were 28 assaults per every 10,000 apprehensions. In the interior, ICE agents and officers saw 48 assaults in 2017, tying 2010 as the highest in records going back to the beginning of the decade.\n\nICE officers and Border Patrol agents have reported an increasing willingness on the part of migrants to resort to violence in recent years. One of the assaults recorded in 2017 involved Lester Sadict Cruz-Garcia, an immigrant from Honduras who was arrested by police in New York on a domestic assault charge. Despite a request by ICE that he be held, police released him into the community.\n\nWhen ICE officers attempted to apprehend Cruz-Garcia, he struggled and kicked, attempting to get away. He was eventually handcuffed but bit one of the officers on the arm. The officer was taken to a hospital and prescribed antibiotics. Cruz-Garcia was sentenced in June to 364 days in jail.\n\nIn another incident in 2017, ICE officers in Massachusetts were trying to deport Mohammed Kenneh to Liberia. Kenneh knocked one officer to the ground and used the handcuffs around his wrists to ensnare the officer's hand, refusing to let go. The officer had to be taken to the emergency room.\n\nProsecutors often refuse to bring charges or win cases against the perpetrators, the audit found. The new numbers could even be underselling the problem, investigators said, because the government doesn't do a good job of tracking incidents, and agents and officers don't always report them properly.",
    " Title: Tech Giants Apple and Google Collaborate on Contact Tracing Technology for COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to aid in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, tech giants Apple and Google have joined forces to develop software for contact tracing. The software aims to alert individuals who have come into close proximity with people who have contracted the virus.\n\nContact tracing is considered a valuable tool in public health efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. Various leading public health authorities, universities, and NGOs worldwide are working on opt-in contact tracing technology. To further this initiative, Apple and Google will launch a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology to facilitate contact tracing.\n\nThe plan is to implement this solution in two stages while prioritizing user privacy. In May, both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities. These official apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores. In the coming months, Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by integrating this functionality into the underlying platforms. This more robust solution would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities.\n\nPrivacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and both companies look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders. They will openly publish information about their work for others to analyze.\n\nHowever, Hot Air's Allahpundit has expressed skepticism about the ability for people to truly \"opt out\" of data mining. In a blog post, Allahpundit wrote, \"If I understand that correctly, they\u2019re going to roll this out quickly by first providing it as an app available for download\u2014called Contact Tracing, neatly enough. Then, in stage two, they\u2019re going to build it right into the iOS and Android operating systems while providing some sort of option to opt out.\"\n\nAllahpundit questions the thoroughness of the \"opt out\" and suggests that the movements of opt-outs might still be tracked. He also raises concerns about the potential for the default setting on contact tracing to be set to turn it on and force users to turn it off.\n\nAllahpundit notes that Apple and Google's app appears to function similarly to a program instituted by Germany to combat the virus, which broadcasts different IDs every 30 minutes as someone goes about their day. If a person tests positive for coronavirus, then it would trace which IDs came into contact with the temporary IDs of the coronavirus-positive person and send them an alert that they may have interacted with someone who had COVID-19.\n\nHowever, as Allahpundit points out, this requires widespread testing for the virus, something that is not yet available.",
    " Title: Senate Passes Tax Overhaul Bill, Moving Closer to Major Legislative Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has passed a sweeping tax overhaul bill worth approximately $1.4 trillion, moving one step closer to President Donald Trump's first significant legislative victory and potential tax cuts for many Americans. The vote, which took place early Saturday morning, was 51-49, with Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee being the sole member of the GOP to side with the Democrats in opposition.\n\nFollowing the vote, President Trump tweeted his reaction, stating, \"We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America.\" He also thanked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch for guiding the bill through the Senate. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., responded by calling the legislation a \"betrayal of the American middle class.\"\n\nThe bill is not yet finalized, as the Senate and House have passed similar tax reform plans. Negotiators from both chambers will begin meeting on Monday to agree on a single piece of legislation that both chambers must approve before it is sent to the president for his signature.\n\nThe Senate bill eliminates federal deductions for state and local income and sales taxes but allows deductions of up to $10,000 in local property taxes. The legislation originally eliminated federal deduction for all state and local taxes, but the property tax exemption was later added at the insistence of Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\n\nLike the House bill, the Senate bill nearly doubles the standard deduction level to $12,000 for individuals (up from $6,350) and $24,000 for couples (up from $12,700). The Senate bill retains the current limit for the home mortgage interest deduction to interest paid on the first $1 million of the loan. The Senate version also preserves the deduction for medical expenses not covered by insurance, but ends deductions for moving expenses and tax preparation.\n\nThe Senate bill allows owners of so-called \"pass-through\" businesses to deduct 23 percent of their earnings, and then pay at their personal income tax rate on the remainder. The Senate bill also keeps seven tax brackets, but reduces them to 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35, and 38.5 percent. The House measure condenses seven brackets to four: 12, 25, 35, and 39.6 percent.\n\nThe Senate and House bills both eliminate the $4,050 personal tax exemption. The changes will not have any impact on your taxes for 2017, which are due to the IRS by April 17, 2018 (you get an extra 48 hours to file because the traditional April 15 due date falls on a Sunday). The differences in the bills will be hashed out in the coming days, with the House expected to vote on a motion to go to conference on the tax bills on Monday evening. The Senate is expected to vote on a similar measure soon after. Congress is scheduled to adjourn for its Christmas break on Dec. 15, but House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he will keep the House in session beyond that date if necessary to get tax reform passed.",

The House Energy and Commerce Committee has requested Sebelius to testify on Thursday regarding the website's issues, which have been marked by crashes, slow responses, and other glitches since its launch on October 1.\n\nSebelius has yet to respond publicly to the House Energy and Commerce Committee's request, but her refusal to testify has sparked calls for her resignation. Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio expressed reluctance to call for an immediate dismissal but criticized Sebelius for not agreeing to testify, stating that her refusal has undermined her credibility.\n\nHouse investigators are seeking to determine whether officials involved in the website were aware of or concealed problems, as they repeatedly claimed the site was \"on track\" to launch. Though the White House reported that 476,000 people have applied online for health insurance, officials have yet to disclose the number of people who have purchased a policy.\n\nMissouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt stated that Sebelius' position appears \"unsustainable,\" and that she will have to testify. The House investigators' focus on Secretary Sebelius intensified after she appeared on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\" last week to discuss the website. Michigan Republican Fred Upton, the Commerce committee chairman, has repeatedly stated, \"Secretary Sebelius had time for Jon Stewart, and we expect her to have time for Congress.\"",
    " Title: Judge Delays Sentencing for Michael Flynn, Former National Security Adviser, for Lying to FBI\n\nArticle:\n\nA U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan criticized Michael Flynn, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, for lying to FBI agents during an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The judge delayed sentencing Flynn until he has completed his cooperation with prosecutors.\n\nDuring the hearing, Judge Sullivan stated that Flynn had arguably betrayed his country by operating as an undeclared lobbyist for Turkey while working on Trump's campaign team and preparing to be his White House national security adviser. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his December 2016 conversations with Sergei Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador in Washington, about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by the administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller, leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, had asked the judge not to sentence Flynn to prison because he had already provided \"substantial\" cooperation over the course of many interviews. Lying to the FBI carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison, and Flynn's plea agreement stated that he was eligible for a sentence of between zero and six months.\n\nJudge Sullivan sternly told Flynn his actions were abhorrent, noting that Flynn had also lied to senior White House officials, who in turn misled the public. The judge said he had read additional facts about Flynn's behavior that have not been made public. At one point, Sullivan asked prosecutors if Flynn could have been charged with treason, although the judge later said he had not been suggesting such a charge was warranted.\n\n\"Arguably, you sold your country out,\" Sullivan told Flynn. \"I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense.\"\n\nFlynn, dressed in a suit and tie, showed little emotion throughout the hearing, and spoke calmly when he confirmed his guilty plea and answered questions from the judge. Judge Sullivan appeared ready to sentence Flynn to prison but then gave him the option of a delay in his sentencing so he could fully cooperate with any pending investigations and bolster his case for leniency. The judge told Flynn he could not promise that he would not eventually sentence him to serve prison time.\n\nFlynn accepted that offer. Sullivan did not set a new date for sentencing but asked Mueller's team and Flynn's attorney to give him a status report by March 13. Sullivan later imposed travel restrictions on Flynn, ordering him to surrender his passport and to obtain court permission before traveling outside the Washington area. The curbs are typical for people released on their own recognizance, the judge said.\n\nProsecutors said Flynn had already provided most of the cooperation he could, but it was possible he might be able to help investigators further. Flynn's attorney said his client is cooperating with federal prosecutors in a case against Bijan Rafiekian, his former business partner who has been charged with unregistered lobbying for Turkey. Rafiekian pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to those charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Flynn is expected to testify.\n\nProsecutors have said Rafiekian and Flynn lobbied to have Washington extradite a Muslim cleric who lives in the United States and is accused by Turkey's government of backing a 2016 coup attempt. Flynn has not been charged in that case.\n\nFormer U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn departs after his sentencing was delayed at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2018. (Photo by Joshua Roberts)\n\nFlynn was a high-profile adviser to Trump's campaign team. At the Republican Party's national convention in 2016, Flynn led Trump's supporters in cries of \"Lock her up!\" directed against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. A group of protesters, including some who chanted \"Lock him up,\" gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday, along with a large inflatable rat fashioned to look like Trump. Several Flynn supporters also were there, cheering as he entered and exited. One held a sign that read, \"Michael Flynn is a hero.\"\n\nFlynn became national security adviser when Trump took office in January 2017, but lasted only 24 days before being fired. He told FBI investigators on Jan. 24, 2017, that he had not discussed the U.S. sanctions with Kislyak when in fact he had, according to his plea agreement. Trump has said he fired Flynn because he also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts with Kislyak.\n\nTrump has said Flynn did not break the law and has voiced support for him, raising speculation the Republican president might pardon him. \"Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!\" Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning.\n\nAfter the hearing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the FBI had \"ambushed\" Flynn in the way agents questioned him, but said his \"activities\" at the center of the case \"don't have anything to do with the president\" and disputed that Flynn had committed treason. In contrast, Trump has called his former long-time personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to separate charges, a \"rat.\"\n\nMueller's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe has cast a shadow over his presidency. Several former Trump aides have pleaded guilty in Mueller's probe, but Flynn was the first former Trump White House official to do so. Mueller also has charged a series of Russian individuals and entities.\n\nTrump has called Mueller's investigation a \"witch hunt\" and has denied collusion with Moscow. Russia has denied meddling in the election, contrary to the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that have said Moscow used hacking and propaganda to try to sow discord in the United States and boost Trump's chances against Clinton.",
    " Title: Death Toll in California Wildfires Reaches 42, With 228 Missing\n\nArticle:\n\nThirteen more bodies have been recovered in California, bringing the death toll in the state's deadliest wildfire to 42, officials say. The remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state. At least 228 people are missing as the Camp Fire continues to rage. Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk.\n\nThe fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31. Speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead and the official number of missing.\n\nIn the south of the state, other wildfires are menacing lives and property. The Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people, damaging beach resorts, including Malibu. More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has declared a \"major disaster\" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents. Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate.\n\nSorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she had first been woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend. Describing the scene as \"exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen,\" she said she had not known if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened.\n\n\"I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,\" she told the Newsday programme. \"It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised - I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it.\"\n\nMany of the victims are believed to be elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Cadaver dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them.\n\nThe fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials say. The separate Woolsey Fire started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials say. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed. The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order.\n\nHistorically, California's \"wildfire season\" started in summer and ran into early autumn, but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment.\n\nThe state's 40 million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. And then there is climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, Governor Jerry Brown declared: \"This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal.\"\n\nThousands of firefighters, some from across the US, have been brought in to help battle the blazes.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Discuss Impeachment Proceedings and Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews, several high-profile figures have discussed the potential for impeachment proceedings based on the findings of the Mueller report.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, stated, \"I believe we have very good reason to believe that an investigation has been conducted, which has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice. I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.\"\n\nWarren further argued, \"If any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail. If there is going to be any accountability, that accountability has to come from the Congress, and the tool that we are given for that accountability is the impeachment process.\"\n\nWhen asked about the current timing of impeachment discussions, Warren responded, \"No.\" When asked why, she stated, \"I think right now, we should continue this investigation. I think Mueller should come before and testify. I don't think we should be having that conversation.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential candidate, expressed a similar viewpoint, stating, \"I think it would be perfectly reasonable for Congress to open up those proceedings, and it's clear that Bob Mueller, in his report, left that in the hands of Congress.\"\n\nSanders continued, \"I think the American people are going to have a chance to decide this at the ballot box in November 2020, and perhaps that's the best way for us to resolve these outstanding questions.\"\n\nWhen asked about impeachment, Senator Amy Klobuchar, also a Democratic presidential candidate, stated, \"The impeachment proceedings are up to the House. They're going to have to make that decision. I am in the Senate, and I believe that we are the jury. So, if the House brings the impeachment proceedings before us, we will deal with them.\"\n\nIt is important to note that these statements represent the opinions of the individuals interviewed and do not necessarily reflect the official position of their respective political parties or the United States government. The impeachment process is a complex and lengthy one, and the outcome remains uncertain at this time.",
    " Title: Police Reform Necessary to Prevent Future Riots, According to Journalist\n\nArticle:\n\nThe destruction of property during the rioting in Minneapolis has been compared to the actions of younger boys in the past, who would destroy glass to earn money for small purchases. This visceral appeal to destroy, often seen in riots, is not exclusive to any race or class, as demonstrated by the willingness of children in wealthy, white areas to destroy property given the opportunity.\n\nThe author argues that the time to stop a riot is before it happens, through prevention measures. One of the most obvious preventive measures is consistent, top-to-bottom police reform. The author criticizes the police for their failure to police themselves, citing the case of George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, as evidence of systemic cultural rot within the police department.\n\nThe author argues that the Minneapolis police union should reconsider whether dues should be used to hire lawyers for bad cops, as the four fired officers are currently being represented by expensive lawyers. The author also questions why the community has tolerated a police department with poor relations between police and citizens of color, and why only one in every 100 citizen complaints leads to disciplinary action.\n\nThe author concludes by stating that the public must demand police reform, but it is ultimately up to the police to root out the bad cops in their midst and prevent future riots. The failure to address police misconduct and systemic cultural issues within police departments will only lead to more anarchy and violence.",
    " Title: Sen. Dianne Feinstein Clashes with Youth Activists over Green New Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) clashed with a group of youth activists over the Green New Deal, a 10-year plan to address climate change. The confrontation took place as moderate Democrats grapple with the Green New Deal, a proposal championed by progressive members such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nDuring the meeting, Sen. Feinstein expressed her reservations about the Green New Deal, stating, \"There's no way to pay for it.\" She also criticized the resolution, saying, \"That resolution will not pass the Senate.\"\n\nWhen a girl urged her to vote yes anyway, Sen. Feinstein replied, \"I may do that... but it's not a good resolution.\"\n\nIn a statement Friday night, Sen. Feinstein said, \"I always welcome the opportunity to hear from Californians who feel passionately about this issue and it remains a top priority of mine.\" She also mentioned that she presented the group with her draft resolution addressing climate change, which she plans to introduce soon.\n\nThe conversation grew heated, particularly when Sen. Feinstein dismissed the group's request due to their tone and youth. A young woman told Sen. Feinstein, \"I'm looking at the faces of the people who will be living with these consequences\" of climate change. Sen. Feinstein responded, \"I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nWhen asked about her age, a girl replied that politicians should listen to the people they represent. Sen. Feinstein, who was re-elected in 2018 with a large margin, responded, \"I've gotten elected. I just ran. I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality, and I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nLater in the meeting, a young woman stressed the need for a climate plan with \"bold, transformative action,\" to which Sen. Feinstein replied, \"Well, you know better than I do.\"\n\nAs the meeting concluded, a woman urged the children to read a letter aloud. Once most of the children exited, several women remained and calmly chatted with Sen. Feinstein. One of them expressed the importance of voting to support the deal, even though it \"isn't something that's aimed at passing right now.\" A 16-year-old inquired about internship opportunities in Sen. Feinstein's office.\n\nThe article does not provide further details about the specifics of the Green New Deal or the draft resolution presented by Sen. Feinstein. The exchange between Sen. Feinstein and the youth activists highlights the ongoing debate among Democrats regarding the best approach to address climate change and the role of youth activism in shaping policy.",
    " Title: Analysis of Speeches at the 2012 DNC: A Review of Sandra Fluke, Jim Sinegal, Elizabeth Warren, and Bill Clinton's Addresses\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second night of the 2012 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Charlotte, North Carolina, concluded with a speech from former President Bill Clinton. The evening's speeches, prior to Clinton's address, were met with mixed reviews.\n\nSandra Fluke, a recent law graduate, delivered a speech that focused on birth control and abortion. Her speech was criticized for its surly and self-pitying tone, as well as her demand for the federal government to compel Catholic schools to pay for her birth control. Fluke's speech was deemed unseemly and crass by some, with comparisons to her 15 minutes of fame.\n\nJim Sinegal, the former CEO of Costco, spoke about the benefits of Democratic policies for businesses. His speech was considered dull and unmemorable, with no meaningful analysis to offer.\n\nElizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law professor, led the class warfare fight, emphasizing the rigged system and the need for increased government investment in various sectors. Her delivery was slightly improved, and she remembered to smile, but her message was still characteristic and reprehensible.\n\nBill Clinton delivered the most effective sales pitch for a \"four more years\" of the Obama administration, according to some. Clinton's speech focused on the challenges Obama faced upon taking office, his accomplishments, and the need for more time to continue improving the economy. Clinton's speech was considered compelling, but some criticized him for straying from the script and overstaying his welcome.\n\nThe media has been eager to move past the floor debacle of the DNC, with some suggesting that Clinton's performance salvaged the lackluster 10pm hour and session. Clinton's star power and strong endorsement certainly helped Obama, but the rest of the night was met with less enthusiasm.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation of Hillary Clinton's Email Practices May Lead to Indictment for Espionage\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into Hillary Clinton's email practices during her tenure as Secretary of State has raised concerns about her handling of state secrets. The FBI's discovery of a Special Access Program (SAP) email on Clinton's private server, as well as the alleged cutting and pasting of state secrets onto her server and BlackBerry, could potentially lead to an indictment for espionage.\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating two broad categories of Clinton's legal woes: her failure to safeguard state secrets and her potential use of her position to financially benefit her husband's charitable foundation. The following details the state secrets aspect of the investigation.\n\nAn SAP-denominated email, the most sensitive category of state secrets, was found on Clinton's private server. SAP emails are so sensitive that they cannot be received or opened accidentally. Clinton, who received all her governmental emails through her husband's server, could only have received or viewed the SAP email after inputting certain codes.\n\nThe presence of the SAP-denominated email on her private server, whether opened or not, indicates a criminal indifference to her legal obligation to maintain the safety of all state secrets entrusted to her care. Clinton's suggested digital ineptitude, which she has used as a potential defense, is not a valid argument in this sensitive area of the law.\n\nFailure to safeguard state secrets is a crime that does not require proof of intent. Plausible deniability, an attempted defense, is not available in this case, as it constitutes an admission of negligence and, therefore, an admission of guilt, not a denial.\n\nClinton signed an oath under penalty of perjury on Jan. 22, 2009, acknowledging that she had received a full FBI briefing on the lawful care and keeping of state secrets. Her briefing and oath specified that the obligation to safeguard state secrets is absolute and that negligence can lead to prosecution.\n\nTypical data protected by the SAP denomination includes the names of moles (spies working for multiple governments), their American handlers, the existence of black ops (illegal programs the U.S. government carries out), codes needed to access state secrets, and ongoing intelligence-gathering projects.\n\nThe crime occurs when SAPs are exposed by residing in a nonsecure venue; it does not matter for prosecution purposes whether they fall into the wrong hands. Clinton's persistent mocking of the seriousness of these issues is seen as the moral equivalent of taunting alligators before crossing a stream.\n\nShortly after the presence of the SAP-denominated email was made known, the State Department released another email Clinton failed to erase, wherein she instructed her subordinates to take state secrets from a secure venue, cut and paste and summarize them, and send them to her on her nonsecure venue. Such an endeavor, if carried out, is a felony\u2014masking and then not safeguarding state secrets.\n\nFurthermore, a little-known 2013 speech by one of Clinton's former subordinates recently surfaced, revealing that Clinton and her staff regularly engaged in digital conversations about state secrets on their BlackBerries. This is not criminal if the BlackBerries were government-issued and secured. Clinton's was neither.\n\nThe article concludes by questioning the state of the rule of law in America, as the FBI's investigation and potential indictment of Clinton will soon reveal the answer.",
    " Title: Romney Kicks Off Six-State Bus Tour in Pennsylvania, Responds to Obama's Immigration Announcement\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, embarked on a six-state bus tour on Saturday, focusing on connecting with undecided voters in battleground states. The tour, which began in New Hampshire on Friday, includes stops in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Romney visited the Weatherly Casting and Machine Company to deliver a message emphasizing his commitment to creating jobs and restoring the American Dream. He highlighted a local entrepreneur who started a business with a second mortgage and now employs about 110 people.\n\n\"Let's put America back to work again with those kinds of dreams,\" Romney said. \"I'm optimistic about the future.\"\n\nThe second stop in Pennsylvania, at an Agway convenience store in Quakertown, was relocated due to a counter rally organized by former Democratic Governor Ed Rendell. Romney's response to the change was that his surrogate, Rendell, had stated they could win Pennsylvania, and they were happy to be there.\n\nThe tour's final stop in Pennsylvania will be an old iron furnace in Cornwall, now a national historic landmark.\n\nDuring the tour, Romney was compelled to address President Obama's announcement to suspend deportation for hundreds of thousands of young, illegal immigrants. He stated that an executive order makes reaching a long-term solution more difficult but, if elected, his administration would strive to find a long-term solution.\n\nRomney's response to the immigration issue was softer than his stance during the GOP primary campaign, where he called the DREAM Act a \"handout\" and vowed to veto it if elected president.\n\nThe bus tour, which involves flying to the next state each night and traveling from town to town during the day, is Romney's first traditional campaign. He is joined by former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and will be joined by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker when the tour reaches Wisconsin, both of whom are considered potential vice presidential candidates.\n\nNo Republican has won Pennsylvania since 1988. In 2008, Republican nominee John McCain won two of the counties Romney plans to visit. The last time Romney was in Pennsylvania, he was campaigning with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and discussing the Cuban-American's ideas for legislation that would allow some illegal immigrants to stay in the country to work.\n\nRomney faces pressure to appeal to Hispanic voters, who are crucial in battleground states like Nevada and Colorado, but risks alienating his conservative base if he abandons his previously tough stances.",
    " Title: Walmart Enters Healthcare Market with Transparent Pricing Model\n\nArticle:\n\nRetail giant Walmart has ventured into the healthcare market with the opening of its first in-store clinic, Walmart Health, in Dallas, Georgia. The new facility offers primary medical, dental, vision, and mental health care services. While Walmart has not announced plans for a national rollout, the Georgia clinic appears to be a pilot for a new approach to providing basic healthcare to Americans.\n\nOne of the notable aspects of the Walmart Health clinic is the transparent pricing model. The company has published a pricing list, detailing costs for services such as basic check-ups ($30, or $20 for children), flu tests ($20), and routine vision exams ($40). The clinic will be staffed by medical professionals capable of handling a range of healthcare services, from immunizations to counseling sessions, lab testing, and X-rays.\n\nWalmart, which is already one of the country's largest pharmacies, has previously offered basic healthcare services in 19 stores through smaller clinics. These clinics average about 1,500 square feet, while the new Walmart Health location in Georgia spans over 10,000 square feet, according to Forbes.\n\nThe move is another example of private-sector innovation in healthcare, with CVS and Walgreens also offering small-scale clinics in some retail locations. Both companies plan to expand these services in the coming years. If Walmart enters the healthcare provider market, it could increase competition and convenience.\n\nElise Amez-Droz, a health care policy associate at the Mercatus Center, a think tank based at George Mason University, commented, \"Walmart Health is proof that the private sector can deliver high-quality, transparently priced health care services without government intervention. The best way to cater to our varying needs is to let patients have the final say in their health care decisions, shopping for better value, and reaping the benefits in the form of better care and savings.\"\n\nAccess to care is an often overlooked aspect of the national healthcare debate, which primarily focuses on providing insurance rather than healthcare itself. While insurance is crucial, it is ineffective if there are no providers nearby. The new Walmart Health clinics could help address this issue, as approximately 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store.\n\nThe pricing model Walmart is implementing could disrupt conventional healthcare pricing. Although the retail chain will accept most major insurance plans, as it does in its pharmacies and existing, smaller clinics, the low, transparent prices will enable many customers to pay out-of-pocket for basic care. This could potentially reduce the opacity in healthcare prices, which is largely due to third parties, such as insurance companies, serving as intermediaries between consumers and providers. This lack of transparency encourages the inflation of healthcare costs and overconsumption of healthcare services.\n\nA single Walmart health clinic in the Atlanta suburbs will not resolve the major issues in the American healthcare system. However, the innovative approach and potential cost savings offered by Walmart Health could lead to improvements in the future.",
    " Title: Sessions to Testify Before Senate Intelligence Committee Amidst Ongoing Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Republican Senator Jeff Sessions will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, setting up another media frenzy at the Capitol Hill just days after James Comey's explosive testimony. Comey's remarks last week, including potential discussions about a third meeting between Sessions and a top Russian official, are threatening to further entangle the Attorney General in the controversy surrounding potential contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\n\nAhead of Sessions' testimony, the White House has sent mixed signals about the level of cooperation Sessions will offer lawmakers. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway stated that Sessions is willing to cooperate and share what he knows, while press secretary Sean Spicer declined to rule out Sessions invoking executive privilege during his testimony, stating, \"I think it depends on the scope of the questions.\"\n\nThe controversy stems from Comey's claims during a closed-door meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee that Sessions may have had an undisclosed third meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. If a third meeting took place, it would contradict Sessions' previous assertion that he only met twice with the Russian official during the presidential campaign.\n\nSessions wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, \"I do not recall any discussions with the Russian ambassador, or any other representative of the Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasions.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has denied that the two talked, stating, \"The then-senator did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.\"\n\nSessions will also face questions over when he decided to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian election meddling, which includes a review of potential ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow to influence the race's outcome. Comey told lawmakers that the FBI expected Sessions to step back from the investigation even before his recusal on March 2.\n\nSessions' decision to recuse himself from the probe reportedly strained his relationship with President Trump, and senators will likely ask Sessions about reports that he offered to resign. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that he first learned Trump planned to fire Comey during a May 8 meeting with Sessions and the president.\n\nSessions and Rosenstein also discussed replacing Comey during a meeting last year, months before Comey was fired. \"In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI,\" Rosenstein told lawmakers, according to his released remarks.\n\nDemocrats argue Sessions would have violated his pledge to recuse himself from the Russia probe if he was involved in Comey's firing. They are expected to ask the attorney general if he knew the president wanted to fire Comey, in part because of the Russia investigation, as Trump has stated publicly.\n\nSessions' testimony will provide insight into the ongoing investigation and the role he played in the events that have transpired since the 2016 presidential campaign. The testimony will be closely watched by both parties, as Sessions' credibility and involvement in the Russia probe remain under scrutiny.",
    " Title: Obama Addresses 2016 Election and Political Polarization at Joint Press Conference with Justin Trudeau\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House on Thursday, President Barack Obama made extended comments regarding the 2016 election and the unprecedented political polarization.\n\n\"I have been blamed by the Republicans for a lot of things,\" the president said. \"But to be blamed for their primaries and who they are selecting is... novel.\"\n\nHe further stated, \"I\u2019m not going to validate some notion that the Republican crackup that\u2019s been taking place is a consequence of actions that I\u2019ve taken.\"\n\nThe president also addressed the accusations that his administration has contributed to the rise of a provocative candidate like Donald Trump. \"It's not as if there's a massive difference between Mr. Trump's position on immigration and Mr. Cruz's,\" he said. \"Mr. Trump may be more provocative in terms of how he sighs, but they're not that different.\"\n\nWhen asked about his critics pointing to the polarized political climate as under his administration as contributing to the rise of such a candidate, President Obama responded, \"I have been blamed by the Republicans for a lot of things, but to be blamed for their primaries and who they are selecting, that is taking place in their primary is... novel.\"\n\nHe also expressed regret over the degree to which polarization and the nasty tone of politics have accelerated over the course of his seven and a half years in office. He acknowledged that Republican political elites, information outlets, social media, television stations, and talk radio have been feeding the Republican base for the last seven years, a notion that everything he does is to be opposed.\n\nPresident Obama also clarified that he does not feel any responsibility for the protectionist rhetoric from some Democratic candidates. He did not provide a timeline for when he may make a presidential endorsement.",
    " Title: Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Chairman Jerrold Nadler Engage in Contentious Exchange During House Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense and contentious House hearing on Friday, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Democratic Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York exchanged sharp words, with Whitaker attempting to call time on Nadler after a series of questions regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nThe heated exchange occurred after Nadler expressed his desire for Whitaker to appear for a private deposition following the hearing and asked Whitaker whether he had been \"asked to approve any requests or action\" for the special counsel.\n\nWhitaker, who was met with gasps from the onlookers, responded, \"Mr. Chairman, I see that your five minutes is up, so... I am here voluntarily. We have agreed to five-minute rounds.\"\n\nNadler, who momentarily smiled at the response, repeated his question, and Whitaker ultimately responded, \"I have not interfered in any way with the special counsel's investigation.\"\n\nThe hearing, which was marked by bickering among Whitaker and Democratic lawmakers, as well as among members of the committee, over whether Whitaker was properly answering questions, saw Whitaker tussle with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas when she pressed on whether he had appeared before the committee for an oversight hearing.\n\nWhile the answer, eventually, was that he had not, the congresswoman objected when Whitaker would not answer with a \"yes or no.\" When she asked the chairman if her time had been restored, Whitaker responded, \"I don't know whether your time's been restored or not.\"\n\n\"Mr. Attorney General, we're not joking here, and your humor is not acceptable,\" the congresswoman responded.\n\nThe fiery back and forth follows a dramatic political prelude to the hearing itself, complete with threats by Nadler to subpoena the witness and threats by the DOJ to boycott. Democrats are acutely focused on Whitaker's oversight of the Mueller probe, in his acting AG status while awaiting confirmation of President Trump's attorney general pick William Barr.\n\n\"There has been no change in the overall management of the special counsel investigation,\" Whitaker testified Friday, saying that he never offered any \"promises or commitments\" regarding the Mueller or any other investigation.\n\nNadler pressed Whitaker over whether he had shared information about the investigation with Trump, or any White House officials.\n\n\"I do not intend today to talk about my private conversations, but to answer your question, I did not talk to the president about the status of the investigation,\" Whitaker answered. \"Consistent with what I've already said, I have not talked about the special counsel's investigation with any White House officials.\"\n\nWhitaker did not directly answer several of Nadler's other questions, resulting in the chairman requesting that the acting attorney general return to the committee at a later date.\n\n\"I've given you a fair opportunity so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don't appear to have done any of that,\" Nadler said, referring to Whitaker's preparations, while saying, \"I do not believe issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem.\" Nadler explained that the committee would \"attempt to reach an accommodation with the department to receive answers,\" so Whitaker can return for \"deposition before the committee, under oath.\"\n\nNadler said that, at that point, he expects \"clean answers or proper assertion of privilege claimed by the president.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the top Republican on the committee blasted the hearing as a \"dog and pony show.\"\n\n\"This hearing is a character assassination on Acting Attorney General Whitaker, all pure political theater, to go after the president,\" Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga, said in his opening statement while urging the committee to adjourn.\n\nA vote was then taken on whether to abruptly end the hearing. The measure did not pass, and the hearing began as scheduled.\n\nThe hearing follows an intense back and forth between the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee a day earlier. The Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to give Nadler the authority to issue a subpoena if necessary, despite Whitaker having already agreed to appear before the panel voluntarily.\n\nNadler made clear early Thursday that he did not want to have to subpoena Whitaker, but said a \"series of troubling events\" suggested it would be better for him to be prepared with that authority, just in case he decided not to show up for the hearing.\n\nBut Whitaker then warned he would not show up unless lawmakers dropped the threat.\n\nMUELLER DEPUTY BRIEFED ON ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER RESEARCH MONTHS BEFORE 2016 ELECTION: TESTIMONY\n\nThe hearing Friday comes as the Senate is close to confirming Trump's nominee for attorney general. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday voted, along party lines, to advance Barr's nomination to the full Senate for confirmation.\n\nThe president fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, the day after the 2018 midterm elections. Prior to Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein oversaw the Russia investigation.\n\nNadler and other Democrats have criticized Whitaker for not recusing himself from the Mueller probe, as Sessions did due to his involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016, as Whitaker had made public comments criticizing the investigation.\n\nThe hearing is the committee's first major oversight hearing looking at the Justice Department of this Congress. Whitaker told reporters last week that Mueller's probe was \"close to being completed,\" the first official sign that the investigation may be nearing an end. His comments, though, were a departure for the Justice Department, which rarely comments on the status of investigations. Whitaker, though, said he had been \"fully briefed\" on the probe.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Bladensburg Peace Cross, Citing Community Devotion and Historical Significance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 7-2 ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a 40-foot Latin cross that stands on public park land in Maryland. The court determined that the cross, which has been a war memorial and an expression of community grief for soldiers lost in World War I, does not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\n\nThe Bladensburg Cross, erected by the American Legion, has been a symbol of religious freedom controversy, with both sides of the church-state divide questioning the justices' decision. In the case American Legion v. American Humanist Association, the court ruled that the cross passes constitutional muster, and removing it would show unconstitutional \"hostility\" towards religion.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito, who wrote the key opinion, stated that the Religion Clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a harmonious society where people of all beliefs can coexist. He argued that the presence of the Bladensburg Cross on the land where it has stood for nearly a century is consistent with that aim.\n\nThe cross was designed to mirror the crosses that stood on the graves of the troops who died during the Great War, and the names of 49 soldiers are engraved at the base of the cross. The 1961 acquisition of the land where the cross stands by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission created the church-state clash that the cross' opponents raised with the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, who agreed with the main ruling, stated that the case would have been different if there was evidence that the American Legion erected the cross to disparage or disrespect people of faiths other than Christianity. However, he noted that there was no such evidence.\n\nThe ruling overturns the decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected the cross in a 2-1 decision. The court's decision is a significant victory for religious liberty advocates, who view it as a landmark ruling that ends the \"weaponizing\" of the Establishment Clause to attack religious symbols in public.\n\nHowever, the ruling leaves hundreds of other religion-themed memorials across the country to be fought over one by one, as the justices were unable to come to any consensus about how to approach them. The court's decision also marks the latest blow to the \"Lemon test,\" the Supreme Court's 1971 framework for deciding religion-state entanglements.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented, stating that the Peace Cross is impossible to view as anything other than the chief symbol of Christianity and leaving it on public land \"elevates\" that religion above all others. She suggested moving the cross to another location to solve the religious entanglement.\n\nThe American Humanist Association, which lost the case, took solace in the court's limited ruling, stating that it feared the justices would overturn the Lemon test and pave the way for even broader religious displays by government. The park commission that owns the land said it was \"gratified\" to have prevailed, stating that the cross is an important reminder of honor, bravery, and sacrifice.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Tendency of Significant Supreme Court Cases to Land at the End of the Term\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in The Duke Law Journal has found that the Supreme Court of the United States tends to decide significant cases towards the end of its term, particularly in June. The study, which considered 7,219 cases from 1946 to 2013, aimed to provide empirical evidence for a phenomenon that is widely observed but difficult to prove.\n\nThe study, led by Professor Lee Epstein of Washington University in St. Louis, used several measures to define and identify significant cases. These measures included front-page coverage in The New York Times, the number of friend-of-the-court briefs filed, and the frequency of the decision's citation in later Supreme Court opinions.\n\nThe results of the study confirmed that significant decisions were disproportionately likely to be handed down in late June. More than 30% of the court's decisions are issued in June, and more than half of those decisions are made in the last week of the month.\n\nGeoffrey R. Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago who served as a clerk to Justice William J. Brennan Jr., stated, \"I can't think of an instance, certainly during my term, that the court sat on an opinion when it was done.\" Deanne E. Maynard, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster who served as a law clerk to Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Stephen G. Breyer, echoed this sentiment, stating, \"The court uses as much time as they have to decide the really important cases.\"\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the end-of-term crunch for big cases may be due to human nature, as the court attempts to decide the most important cases before the summer recess. However, the study's authors acknowledge that the question of whether big cases are disproportionately likely to come late requires an objective definition of significance, which can be challenging to establish.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens Iran with Severe Consequences in Late-Night Tweet\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a late-night tweet on Sunday, President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran, stating, \"Iran must never, ever threaten the United States again.\" The tweet, sent at 11:24 p.m. Eastern Time, came in response to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's remarks suggesting that \"war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\"\n\nThe tweet, written in all capital letters, continued, \"WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!\" The message was directed at Rouhani.\n\nOn Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's tweet, stating that Trump was not inciting a confrontation and that Iran was the one \"inciting anything.\" National Security Advisor John Bolton also supported Trump's statement, saying, \"President Trump told me that if Iran does anything at all to the negative, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid before.\"\n\nIranian government officials responded cautiously to Trump's tweet. Gholamhossein Gharibpour, the head of the voluntary Basij paramilitary force, described Trump's words as \"psychological warfare.\" Foaz Izadi, a prominent commentator close to the establishment, suggested that Trump's tweet was aimed at addressing his domestic base in the U.S.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran have escalated since Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year. The move unraveled a signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration and threatened to destabilize Iran's denuclearization program.\n\nIn his remarks, Rouhani warned Trump, saying, \"Mr. Trump, don't play with the lion's tail, this would only lead to regret.\" He also stated, \"America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also criticized Iran in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California. He accused Iran's political, judicial, and military leaders of widespread corruption and human rights abuses. Pompeo also accused several Iranian leaders, including Ayatollahs, of participating in illicit trading and amassing vast wealth.\n\nThe U.S. is preparing to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran, with the first sanctions expected to hit on August 4. The Trump administration has stated that it aims to cut off funds to Iran, focusing on reimposing sanctions on its banking and energy sectors.",
    " Title: Millennial Incomes Stagnant in Four Major Employment Sectors, According to Young Invincibles Report\n\nArticle:\n\nA report by the advocacy group Young Invincibles, using Census data, reveals that salaries for young adults have decreased in four of the top five biggest employment sectors for individuals aged 25 to 34. The sectors experiencing a decline include retail (down 9.9 percent), leisure and hospitality (down 14.65 percent), manufacturing (down 2.87 percent), and professional and business services (down 4.28 percent). The only exception is the health care industry, which has seen essentially stagnant yearly pay (up just 0.10 percent).\n\nThe report's authors note that the group is measuring annual, not hourly, pay, making it difficult to interpret the statistics with depth. They did not know whether young adult incomes were falling because workers were making less per hour or because they were working fewer hours in total. The authors suggest that the decrease in income is more likely due to the latter, given the post-recession rise of joblessness and part-time employment.\n\nIn comparison to the median young adult income of $30,759, which is its lowest in inflation-adjusted terms since 1995, the income levels of millennials are similar to those of Generation X. However, millennials are shouldering more debt due to student loans compared to previous generations.\n\nThe report also analyzed wages from 18-to-24-year-olds, but it seems pointless to look at wages of the prime college-age demographic without distinguishing between full- and part-time workers. The report's findings suggest that millennials are not exceptionally poorly paid compared to young adults who came before them, but they are stretching the same wages to pay off a bigger heap of loans.",
    " Title: U.S. on Alert for Potential North Korean Missile Launch, Threatening Denuclearization Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. officials are on high alert for signs of a possible missile launch from North Korea in the coming days, which officials have referred to as a \"Christmas gift.\" A significant launch or nuclear test would mark a breach of North Korea's self-imposed moratorium on missile launches and tests, and it would pose a significant challenge to President Trump's foreign policy goal of getting North Korea back to the negotiating table to eliminate its nuclear weapons.\n\nEarlier this month, the North conducted what U.S. officials say was an engine test, which experts believe may have involved an engine for a long-range missile. Anthony Wier, a former State Department official who tracks nuclear disarmament for the Friends Committee on National Legislation, stated, \"North Korea has been advancing. It has been building new capabilities. As long as that continues, they gain new capabilities to try new missiles to threaten us and our allies in new ways.\"\n\nNorth Korea warned of a possible \"Christmas gift\" in early December, stating that the Trump administration was running out of time on nuclear negotiations, and it was up to the U.S. to choose what \"Christmas gift\" it gets from Pyongyang.\n\nVictor Cha, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said a review of the possible launch sites in North Korea shows they are \"basically ready to go.\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters earlier this week that the U.S. has heard all the talk of a possible upcoming test around Christmas.\n\nArmy Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Friday that the U.S., Japan, and South Korea are ready to defend against any move by the North. \"We always maintain very high levels of readiness,\" he said.\n\nAt a meeting in Singapore in June 2018, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a joint statement that the North \"commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" However, negotiations stalled in February after the U.S. rejected North Korea's demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North's nuclear capabilities.\n\nAccording to the U.S. military, North Korea has launched more than 20 missiles this year, including new types of missiles and a submarine-launched ballistic missile, in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. In 2017, North Korea conducted a torrent of missile tests, including flying two intermediate-range missiles over Japan and threatening to fire those weapons toward the U.S. territory of Guam. It also tested three developmental ICBMs, including the Hwasong-15 that demonstrated the potential range to reach deep into the U.S. mainland.\n\nHowever, those ICBM tests showed no clear sign the North had perfected the technology needed to ensure a warhead could survive atmospheric re-entry. Experts said North Korea needed additional flight tests to determine the reliability and accuracy of its ICBMs and establish a capable re-entry protection system.\n\nJames Carafano, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, stated, \"The U.S. and North Korea have a chance to break the logjam.\" Defense Secretary Esper, who has visited Korea twice this year since being sworn in as defense chief, said the U.S. now has a team on the Korean peninsula that has asked the North for meetings. At the same time, he said the U.S. military remains at a high level of readiness.\n\nA key discussion point has been the reduction in U.S. military exercises with South Korea, a move by the Trump administration to appease North Korea and woo them to the negotiating table for denuclearization talks. The U.S. has about 28,000 troops in South Korea.",
    " Title: China Imposes Tariffs on US Imports, Including Pork and Wine, in Response to US Steel and Aluminum Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nChina has implemented tariffs of up to 25% on 128 US imports, such as pork and wine, following US President Donald Trump's imposition of duties on foreign steel and aluminum imports in March. The tariffs, affecting approximately $3 billion (\u00a32.1 billion) of imports, took effect on Monday.\n\nBeijing stated that the move was to safeguard China's interests and counterbalance losses caused by new US tariffs. China had previously expressed that it did not want a trade war but would not stand idly by if its economy was affected. Mr. Trump, however, has maintained that \"trade wars are good\" and that the US should \"easily\" win one.\n\nThe US authorities have already announced plans for further targeted tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, reportedly in response to unfair trading practices in China that affect US companies. This development, however, raises the possibility of further action in what has become a tit-for-tat trade battle.\n\nThe initial trigger for this trade dispute was China's alleged theft of foreign intellectual property. According to Washington, if international companies wish to operate in China, they must surrender their intellectual property, thereby transferring technology, such as German high-speed rail technology, to Chinese engineers.\n\nWith China's retaliatory tariffs now in place, there are concerns that launching a potential tariff war may not be the solution to the problem. Some argue that China has been getting away with this practice for years, and tough measures were necessary to force change. Others, however, express worry that a trade war is not the way to address the issue.\n\nThe overall imbalance in US-China trade, with a large Chinese surplus, means China is potentially more exposed during a trade war than the US. For this reason, Beijing will likely seek a way out of this escalating tariff standoff.\n\nChina's initial tariffs are relatively mild but are in response to the first round of US tariffs, with a second round already announced. There are many more American companies to be affected, and other nations, particularly those in Europe and Asia, could soon find themselves involved in this conflict.\n\nUS scrap aluminum and frozen pork will be subject to a 25% additional tariff, in addition to existing duties. Several other American foods, including nuts, fresh and dried fruit, ginseng, and wine, will be hit by a 15% increase. Rolled steel bars will also see a 15% rise in duties.\n\nChina described the new tariffs as a retaliatory measure in response to Mr. Trump's decision to raise duties on steel and aluminum imports. On March 22, the US announced plans to impose duties on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and limit its investment in the US, in retaliation for years of alleged intellectual property theft. The White House stated it was acting to counter unfair competition from China's state-led economy.\n\nIt remains to be seen if China will follow its opening gambit with stronger measures. In theory, Beijing could tax US tech companies like Apple, for example. Such a move could force US tech giants to raise their prices to compensate.",
    " Title: Former President Obama Calls for Calm in Ferguson, Missouri, After Shooting Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama has urged calm in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of a black teenager by police that has led to two nights of unrest. In a statement, Obama described the death of Michael Brown as heartbreaking and called for reflection and understanding.\n\nOver the past two nights, dozens of arrests were made, shops were looted, and tear gas was used by police in the St. Louis suburb. However, on Tuesday night, anger turned to reflection at a community forum. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, speaking at a packed crowd at Christ the King United Church of Christ, described the shooting as reopening an old wound.\n\nFerguson's mayor and police chief attended the meeting and were greeted with applause. Earlier, the Reverend Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist, appealed for peace, stating that becoming violent in Michael Brown's name betrays the gentle giant he was. Sharpton was flanked by Brown's parents during his address.\n\nPolice have stated that Brown was shot several times after a struggle in a police car, but witnesses have reported that the unarmed Brown was shot while he had his arms raised. The identity of the officer who shot and killed Brown remains undisclosed due to death threats on social media, according to police.\n\nProtests during the day on Tuesday were peaceful but tense, but they followed a night of unrest where police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a large crowd in Ferguson the night before. Thirty-two people were arrested on Sunday night after people looted shops, vandalized cars and stores, and set a building alight.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has stated that the case deserves a \"fulsome review.\" The justice department has also sent its community relations team to the area.",
    " Title: The Origins and Evolution of Labor Day: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nLabor Day, celebrated on the first Monday in September, is a unique American holiday, distinct from other national holidays in both its origins and its cultural significance. Unlike holidays such as Washington's Birthday (now known as Presidents Day), Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Memorial Day, Labor Day did not become a national holiday until 1895.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Labor Day is its transformation into a symbolic end of summer and the beginning of fall. Prior to the 1890s, summer would end when the weather changed, sometimes as late as mid-October or early November. However, most warm-weather institutions, such as community swimming pools, now conclude their season on Labor Day, regardless of whether the best summer weather still lies ahead. The day after Labor Day also used to mark the first day of the school year, but many states now open their school doors in August.\n\nThe primary advocate for Labor Day was Peter J. McGuire, a figure not widely recognized outside of historians' homes. McGuire, the son of Irish immigrants, made his mark as a carpenter and became a leading force behind the trade's unionization. On August 8, 1881, 36 delegates representing carpenters in 11 states came together to form the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, with McGuire serving as the principal administrator. The organization grew from a few members to 70,000 strong by the end of the century.\n\nMcGuire proposed a special day for all workers to advance the cause of unionism, aiming to break up the long holiday-barren period from July 4 to Thanksgiving. The day would provide workers with leisure time and offer unions the opportunity to increase their numbers and visibility through parades and demonstrations. McGuire's idea was supported by the UBC, which organized the first Labor Day in New York City on September 5, 1882.\n\nThe establishment of a national Labor Day was initially slow to materialize. Oregon made Labor Day the first Saturday in June in 1887, while cities such as Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, and Kansas City celebrated their first Labor Days in 1889. Southern cities were conspicuous non-celebrators. It was clear that only a national holiday would serve the interests of McGuire and his followers.\n\nAn unexpected economic collapse in 1893, leading to a bitter railway strike in Pullman, Illinois, accelerated the push for a national Labor Day. In Pullman, the head of the Pullman Palace Car Company had built a model town for his employees in 1880. When the economic downturn occurred, wages were cut, but rents remained constant. After lengthy negotiations, the workers, assisted by the American Railway Union and its leader, Eugene V. Debs, went on strike in May 1894. A month later, the union initiated a boycott of Pullman cars on all American trains. The railroads retaliated by firing union members, and the strike spread to trains across 27 states. The federal government eventually dispatched troops, and Debs was convicted of violating an injunction issued by the attorney general, serving six months in jail in 1895.\n\nWith the Pullman strike and public concerns about additional labor strife, legislation establishing a national Labor Day was rushed through both houses of Congress and signed by President Grover Cleveland in 1894. The immediate beneficiaries were the large number of workers who preferred a day off to the principle of unionism.\n\nIn another twist, neither McGuire nor Debs would become rallying leaders for workers on subsequent Labor Days. McGuire's ideas for a loose federation of unions within the United Brotherhood of Carpenters clashed with the rank and file, and in 1901, he was ousted on what was generally thought to be trumped-up charges of embezzling union funds. Debs, a Socialist Party candidate for president in five elections, spent additional time in jail for having violated the Espionage Act during World War I.\n\nFinally, union leaders in the years after the first national Labor Day were unsuccessful in making the holiday their special day. For it was \"labor\" day, not a \"union\" day, the monopoly of no single group. The farmer labored, as did the merchant, physician, lawyer, and clerk. There would always be far more of these sorts than there would be workers carrying union cards.",
    " Title: President Trump Expresses Dissatisfaction with Media Coverage Ahead of 100-Day Mark\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a Friday morning tweet, expressed his dissatisfaction with the national media's coverage of his administration's accomplishments, stating, \"No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!\"\n\nThe White House's apparent preparation for media scrutiny as the 100-day benchmark approaches was not explicitly clear. The first 100 days of a first-term president is often used to measure success and set a roadmap for future policy issues. This practice dates back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who signed 76 pieces of legislation, including 15 major overhauls and new programs, during the depths of the Great Depression in 1933.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer stated, \"It's very clear that he's committed to the conservative principles and agenda that he outlined in the campaign.\" Since then, the first 100 days has been a test of a new president's productivity, though none have come close to matching FDR's achievements.\n\nDuring his campaign, President Trump had promised significant changes in his first 100 days, including cracking down on illegal immigration, a complete tax overhaul, and the repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare). In an October 2016 rally, he stated, \"You're going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost and it's going to be so easy.\"\n\nRegarding his \"big beautiful wall\" with Mexico, Trump stated in 2015, \"So simple. So simple.\" However, expectations were high given Trump's promises and the fact he had a Republican-led Congress, but so far, the two branches have not always been on the same page.\n\nOn Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the Trump administration's accomplishments in the first 90 days. Spicer told \u2588\u2588\u2588' \"The First 100 Days,\" \"It's very clear that he's committed to the conservative principles and agenda that he outlined in the campaign.\" The specifics of these accomplishments were not detailed in the provided text.",

He claimed that the family received a call from Mountain View police around 2 a.m. Tuesday, informing them that they had found Nasim sleeping in a car. He warned the police that she might be headed to YouTube due to her dislike for the company.\n\nMountain View Police spokeswoman Katie Nelson confirmed that officers located a woman by the same name asleep in a Mountain View parking lot Tuesday morning. However, Nelson did not respond to a question about whether police were warned Aghdam might go to YouTube.\n\nNasim Aghdam reportedly maintained a personal website alleging that YouTube compensated her unfairly and censored her views. Authorities are still investigating Aghdam's motive, and there are no indications she knew the victims.\n\nIn online postings last month, Aghdam alleged that YouTube tries to \"censor and suppress people who speak the truth.\" She also claimed, \"YouTube stopped everything, and now she has no income.\"\n\nA website reportedly belonging to Aghdam contains several screenshots purportedly showing Aghdam's YouTube user account page. The screenshots suggest that at least one of Aghdam's YouTube accounts had been \"de-monetized,\" meaning that she was not earning significant revenue from her uploads to the site.\n\nThe company \"de-monetizes\" some channels for reasons including inappropriate material or having fewer than 1,000 subscribers. Text superimposed on one of the screenshots reads, \"My Revenue for 300,000 Views Is $ 0.10?????\"\n\nThe website also espouses veganism, and includes videos apparently showing animals being skinned and cooked alive. Aghdam's YouTube videos had been removed from the site by Tuesday evening for violating the company's terms of service. Her personal website remained online.\n\nIsmail Aghdam told NBC that YouTube \"stopped everything, and now she has no income.\"\n\nThe shooting spree left YouTube employees terrified, huddled inside, calling 911, as officers and federal agents swarmed the company's suburban campus sandwiched between two interstates just south of San Francisco.\n\nYouTube employee Dianna Arnspiger said she was on the building's second floor when she heard gunshots, ran to a window, and saw the shooter on a patio outside. She described the woman as wearing glasses and a scarf and using a \"big huge pistol.\"\n\n\"It was a woman and she was firing her gun. And I just said, 'Shooter!', and everybody started running,\" Arnspiger said.\n\nShe and others hid in a conference room for an hour while another employee repeatedly called 911 for updates.",

The discussion centered on Trump's inconsistency when addressing women-related issues.\n\nKelly questioned Pierson about Trump's evolving stances on various topics, such as the war in Afghanistan, Obamacare, and abortion. She asked Pierson to explain her candidate's inconsistency, to which Pierson responded by attributing Trump's off-the-cuff comments to his appeal as a non-scripted politician.\n\nWhen pressed about Trump's comments on abortion, Kelly asked why he had stated that women should be punished for having an illegal abortion if abortion were made illegal, and then later claimed he misspoke. Pierson attempted to clarify Trump's position by stating that he had provided a statement indicating he did not want to punish women for having an illegal abortion.\n\nKelly pointed out that Trump currently has a 73 percent disapproval rate with women, and questioned how he could perform better in an election with such a high disapproval rating compared to Mitt Romney's 51 percent disapproval rate in the 2012 election. Pierson responded by suggesting that there is a full-scale anti-Trump movement and that the mainstream media is working against Trump's campaign.\n\nIt is unavailable whether Pierson directly addressed Kelly's question about Trump's inconsistency and the potential impact of his high disapproval rate with women on his election prospects.",
    " Title: NPR's Limited Coverage of State Department's Conclusion of Hillary Clinton's Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe State Department recently concluded its investigation, initiated in 2016, into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails. According to an Associated Press report, the investigation found \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\" However, 38 current or former employees were found to have sent classified information, some of which ended up in Clinton's personal email.\n\nWhile the investigation was a significant development in the long-running saga, it received limited coverage from National Public Radio (NPR). A reader pointed out to NPR's Public Editor's office that there is no digital story or newsmagazine report about this development on NPR.org. The story was only covered in six newscasts on Friday, October 18, and Saturday, October 19, during off-hours. Newscast transcripts are not archived online.\n\nNewsroom leaders explained that the decision to cover the story only in newscasts was due to the crush of other important news and an exceedingly stretched staff. Edith Chapin, NPR's vice president and executive editor, stated, \"It was a combination of things: timing and stretched resources, and in the scheme of all the news of late, it just didn't rise up to our re-allocating resources.\"\n\nSarah Gilbert, NPR's vice president for news programming, added that the week's news agenda was dominated by the acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's admission and retraction of a quid pro quo on Ukraine, the Doral G7 announcement and reversal, and the crisis in Syria. In this context, newscast coverage of the 9-page State Department report was deemed adequate.\n\nWhile the other stories were important and arguably far more newsworthy, given the ongoing impeachment inquiry against the president, the State Department finding may have felt anti-climactic, as the FBI had already closed its own investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server in 2016, stating there was no criminal act. NPR covered that at the time.\n\nThe individuals most affected by the new development are the senders of the now-classified emails. However, as recently as September 30, NPR had prominent reports in both Morning Edition and All Things Considered about the State Department's revival of the probe, contacting about 150 current or former employees whose emails had ended up in Clinton's private email. The net effect of that action, and NPR's reporting on it, was to keep alive an issue that President Trump has used to stir up his supporters against Clinton in particular and Democrats in general.\n\nThe end of the State Department's investigation marks a final period on the Clinton email saga that received significant attention in the lead-up to the 2016 election. NPR has an obligation to provide closure after three years, and since there is no other report in the NPR online archive, this article will have to serve as the final word on the matter.",
    " Title: Sen. Marco Rubio Guides President Trump's Cuba Policy, Fosters Pragmatic Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, has found a pragmatic relationship with President Donald Trump, despite their contentious history. This relationship was on display on June 16, as Rubio accompanied Trump on Air Force One to Miami for an important announcement regarding Cuba policy.\n\nRubio, who once called Trump a \"con artist\" and was dubbed \"little\" by the president, has put aside their differences to collaborate on Cuba, China, and Venezuela policy. Trump expressed his gratitude to Rubio during his June announcement, calling him \"a man who has really become a friend of mine.\"\n\nRubio's role in shaping the Cuba policy is significant, as he has been instrumental in crafting the new approach to the Castro regime. This opportunity also allowed Rubio to personally pitch Florida's most ambitious public works project.\n\nThe two have managed to find common ground despite their past disagreements, which were evident during the 2016 campaign. Rubio endorsed Trump after his exit from the presidential race, but did not appear with Trump during Florida visits during the general election campaign.\n\nDuring a June Intelligence Committee hearing featuring former FBI Director James Comey, Rubio questioned the volume of leaks stemming from the agency's probe into Russian meddling with the 2016 election. Rubio's aggressive questioning drew criticism, but he defended his actions, stating that he asked questions directly from Comey's written statement.\n\nRubio has grown to enjoy his role in the Senate after declaring his frustration with the job during his presidential campaign. He has returned to the Senate after pledging not to seek a second term, and seems to have a new appreciation for the position. A key reason for his optimism is his alliance with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nBrian Ballard, a Tallahassee-based lobbyist who supported Rubio for president before becoming Trump's state finance chairman, attributes the two men's relationship to their genuine affection for each other. \"When the election goes the right way, it cures a lot of things,\" he said.\n\nRubio has not gone out of his way to publicly criticize the president, choosing instead to focus on policy and the success of his Florida-related issues and foreign affairs with Trump in the White House. \"If I have an opportunity to influence the administration's policy in a positive direction, I'm going to seek that out,\" he said.\n\nRubio has been a frequent visitor to the White House, dining or meeting with Trump or Vice President Pence several times. On Tuesday, he and two other lawmakers met with Pence to discuss geopolitics in the Western Hemisphere in advance of the vice president's trip to the region.\n\nPolitical science professor Susan MacManus of the University of South Florida in Tampa believes Rubio's relationship with Trump is more issue-focused than power-focused, making it easier to have \"gives and takes.\" MacManus also noted that Rubio has not expressed any interest in running for president in 2020, choosing instead to focus on his service in the Senate.",

The latest signs of tension emerged on Sunday, following a call between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during which the growing concern over Palestinian civilian deaths, Israeli lives lost, and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza was expressed.\n\nThe White House statement, released after the call, emphasized the need for an immediate, unconditional humanitarian cease-fire to end the hostilities and pave the way for a permanent resolution. The statement also referenced Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, which have been met with criticism from some Israeli officials.\n\nThe current tensions can be traced back to several factors. On the U.S. side, there is lingering frustration with Israel's response to previous attempts by Mr. Kerry to broker a broader peace deal with the Palestinians, which stalled just before the discovery of the bodies of three Israeli teenagers, believed to have been killed by Palestinians. This event set off a chain of events that led to the current wave of fighting and rocket attacks.\n\nOn the Israeli side, officials have expressed concerns about the weakness of Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank and the extremism of Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip, leading them to believe they have no viable partner for peace. Some Israeli officials have also viewed the American push for peace as a grandstanding move by Mr. Kerry.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the strained relations is the ongoing talks between the U.S. and five international powers and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program. As the negotiations move closer to an agreement that would allow Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment capacity, Israeli discomfort has grown. The extension of the talks for four more months has further increased Israeli unease.\n\nInitially, the U.S. publicly supported Israel's right to respond when rockets were fired at its cities from Gaza. However, as Israel transitioned from an aerial offensive to a ground incursion, American and Israeli analyses began to diverge. U.S. officials grew concerned that the high number of Palestinian casualties could fuel long-term anger in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, potentially jeopardizing the U.S.'s long-term quest for peace.\n\nAs the diplomatic dance between the U.S. and Israel continues, both sides remain focused on their respective concerns. Israel views Hamas as a problem, but considers Iran's nuclear program an existential threat. The resumption of nuclear talks with Iran is imminent, and this issue is likely to contribute to further tensions between the two nations.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Proposes Expanded Social Media Information Collection for Visa Applicants\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Department of State has proposed a new policy to collect social media identities from nearly all individuals seeking entry into the United States via visas. The proposal, if approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), would require most immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants to list all social media identities they have used in the past five years.\n\nAccording to the proposal, this information will be used for vetting and identifying applicants. The new measures would affect approximately 14.7 million people annually.\n\nThe proposal supports President Donald Trump's campaign promise to implement \"extreme vetting\" of foreigners entering the United States to prevent terrorism. Previously, under rules instituted last May, consular officials were instructed to collect social media identifiers only when they deemed such information necessary to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has expressed concern, stating that the move could have a \"chilling\" effect on freedom of speech and association. Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project, said in a statement, \"People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official.\"\n\nThe ACLU also expressed concern about the potential for the Trump administration to define the term \"terrorist activities\" in a vague and overly broad manner, which could lead to discriminatory visa denials without enhancing national security.\n\nIf approved, the measures would also require applicants to submit five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, and their international travel history. They will be asked if they have been deported or removed from any country and whether family members have been involved in terrorist activities, the department said.\n\nThe department stated that it does not intend to routinely ask most diplomatic and official visa applicants for the additional information.\n\nThe new proposal was published in the Federal Register on Friday, and the public has 60 days to comment on the revised procedures before the OMB approves or rejects them.",
    " Title: US-Russia Syria Peace Conference Prospects Dim as Assad Expresses Confidence in Receiving Russian Missiles\n\nArticle:\n\nThe prospects for a US-Russia jointly sponsored Syria peace conference in Geneva, initially planned for this month, have dimmed following recent events. These events include a defiant interview by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Hezbollah television, in which he expressed confidence in receiving sophisticated Russian anti-aircraft missiles, and a key Syrian opposition group's insistence on not attending the proposed conference.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the US continues to view a Syria peace conference as a key goal, a critical element of the Obama administration's \"two-track\" Syria policy, which involves seeking a political settlement to the conflict while supporting the opposition fighting against Assad.\n\nSome regional experts suggest that the US is playing into Russia's game plan of forestalling a more robust US intervention in Syria by agreeing to co-sponsor peace talks that appear to have little chance of success. The US has rejected this notion, with State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki stating, \"We expect to be able to move forward on a conference.\"\n\nSenior US diplomats will meet next week in Geneva with Russian and UN officials to continue planning for the conference. Some officials speculate that what was originally envisioned for May could now slip into July.\n\nRegarding Russia's delivery of sophisticated weaponry to Assad while working with the US and the United Nations on a peace conference, Psaki said, \"I don't want to speculate on what their motivations are.\" However, she added that Russia has accepted the need for a \"political transition\" in Syria since the first Geneva conference on Syria a year ago, and the US continues to see Russia as a \"partner\" in the diplomatic process due to its ability to bring the Assad regime to the table.\n\nCritics of the White House argue that the administration is allowing the US to be played by the Russians, whose main interest they say is to avoid the kind of decisive intervention the US and other Western powers undertook in Libya in 2011.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ), who recently visited rebel-held Syrian territory, has stated that the rebels are running out of arms and ammunition and are facing growing numbers of Hezbollah and Iranian fighters supporting Assad. Senator McCain has long advocated arming the rebels and imposing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria.\n\nThe increasing deadly conflict in Syria, with a death toll on a path to cross the 100,000 threshold next month, is likely to amplify calls for President Obama to intervene more directly in the conflict. If a negotiated settlement proves elusive, pressure will grow for lethal measures.\n\nSyria's main opposition group, the National Coalition, announced Thursday in Geneva that it would not take part in any negotiations as long as Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Iran are in Syria fighting for the Assad regime. George Sabra, the National Coalition's acting chairman, stated, \"It is difficult to continue when Syrians are constantly being hammered by the Assad regime with the help of outside forces.\"\n\nThis week's setbacks to a diplomatic solution to Syria's increasingly deadly conflict will likely amplify calls for President Obama to intervene more directly in the conflict. If the conflict proves not to be \"ripe\" for a negotiated settlement, they add, pressure will grow for lethal measures.",
    " Title: Former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig Goes on Trial for Alleged False Statements Regarding Ukraine Work\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Obama White House counsel Greg Craig will go on trial on Monday, charged with making false statements related to his work on behalf of Ukrainian interests. The trial, which will take place in the District of Columbia, stems from the investigation conducted by former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nCraig, a prominent attorney in Democratic political circles who has worked for two Democratic presidents, was indicted in April on two counts of providing false statements to the Justice Department regarding his Ukraine work. A judge dismissed one of these counts last week, but Craig will still face trial on the remaining count.\n\nThe case against Craig, who has pleaded not guilty, emerged from Mueller's Russia probe. During its investigation, Mueller's team uncovered evidence of alleged wrongdoing by Craig, which they referred to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia for prosecution.\n\nThe case is one of several that have emerged from the Mueller inquiry and allege violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). FARA requires individuals doing political or public relations work in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign entity to disclose this fact. It is illegal to willfully not register or to provide false or misleading statements to the Justice Department's FARA unit.\n\nIn Craig's case, prosecutors allege that he withheld information that he should have provided to the department and provided other information that he knew was incorrect in connection with his work for the Ukrainian government. Craig's lawyers, William W. Taylor III and William J. Murphy of the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder, have denied that Craig broke the law. In a statement at the time of the indictment, they called the government's prosecution \"a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\"\n\nThe case against Craig dates back to work he and his law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, did for Ukraine's pro-Russian government in 2012. Paul Manafort, who was advising the government in Kiev at the time, helped hire Craig and Skadden to draw up a report on the government's prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nManafort, who later became Trump's campaign chairman in 2016 before resigning amid questions about his Ukraine work, was later convicted in a bank and tax fraud trial in Virginia brought by Mueller's team. Internationally, the case against Tymoshenko was viewed as a politically motivated sham pushed by her rival, then-President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nAfter being brought on board, Skadden drew up a report that validated the Tymoshenko prosecution. Craig then allegedly briefed journalists to shape early international coverage of the report. Craig and Skadden, however, did not register their activities with the Justice Department.\n\nProsecutors say Craig did not register his work with the Justice Department in order to avoid disclosing that Craig and Skadden had been paid $4 million for the work. Publicizing that fact would have undermined the perceived independence and credibility of the report, prosecutors say.\n\nEarly this year, Skadden reached a settlement of its own with the Justice Department, allowing it to avoid prosecution. It agreed to register under FARA and pay about $4.6 million. Craig's trial is expected to last 2 1/2 weeks, with jury selection beginning on Monday.",
    " Title: Giuliani Clarifies Statement on Hush Money Payment to Stormy Daniels\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a recent addition to President Donald Trump's legal team, issued a statement on Friday clarifying his remarks regarding the $130,000 payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Giuliani stated that the payment was not a violation of election law, as it was made to resolve a personal matter to protect the President's family.\n\nIn a series of media interviews this week, Giuliani had suggested that the payment, made by President Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, could have potentially violated federal election law by concealing a campaign contribution. However, in his statement, Giuliani stated, \"The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President\u2019s family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.\"\n\nGiuliani's comments come after President Trump seemed to distance himself from Giuliani's statements, stating that the former federal prosecutor \"really has his heart into it\" but needs to \"get his facts straight.\" Trump added that Giuliani would \"get his facts straight\" but did not specify the statements to which he was referring.\n\nIn a TV interview on Thursday, Giuliani had stated that if Stormy Daniels' claim of an affair had come up in a debate between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, Cohen \"made it go away. He did his job.\"\n\nGiuliani revealed on Wednesday that Trump had repaid Cohen for the $130,000 the lawyer had provided to Daniels. Trump previously had denied knowing about the payment.\n\nIn his statement on Friday, Giuliani stated, \"My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President\u2019s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters.\" However, he did not provide specifics.\n\nGiuliani also addressed the controversy surrounding his statement on James Comey's firing, stating that it was \"undisputed\" that Trump had the constitutional power to fire Comey and that doing so has turned out to be \"plainly in the best interests of our nation.\"\n\nPresident Trump, facing legal troubles on several fronts, indicated a willingness to be interviewed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation but only if he knew he would be treated fairly. Trump is under investigation for potential collusion between his campaign and Russia and for whether he has unlawfully sought to obstruct the investigation.\n\nDuring a pretrial hearing in Virginia on Mueller's charges against Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III openly questioned whether the special counsel had exceeded his prosecutorial powers by bringing the case.",
    " Title: Obama and McConnell Agree on Cooperation, but Differences Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have agreed to work together, with both leaders expressing a desire to find areas of agreement on issues such as trade and tax reform. However, the two leaders have made it clear that they do not see eye-to-eye on many other issues, including immigration reform, the Affordable Care Act, and the minimum wage.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Obama and McConnell discussed their plans for cooperation, with Obama stating that he is willing to \"drink Kentucky bourbon\" with McConnell and work to improve their relationship with congressional Republicans. McConnell, for his part, declared that any executive actions by Obama on immigration reform would be \"like waving a red flag in front of a bull,\" while Obama made it clear that he will move forward with executive action on immigration reform, as Congress has not passed a bill on the issue.\n\nOn the issue of the Affordable Care Act, McConnell called the law a \"huge legislative mistake\" and vowed to continue fighting it, while Obama insisted that a minimum wage increase will still be a priority for his administration. McConnell also promised to move ahead on the Keystone pipeline, another nonstarter for the president.\n\nIn response to the sweeping Republican victories in the midterm elections, both Obama and McConnell acknowledged the need for cooperation, but it remains unclear how much actual cooperation will occur. McConnell has stated that there will be no government shutdown or default on the national debt, but he also indicated that the Senate will send Obama bills that he is likely to veto.\n\nRepublican leaders have called for the party to work with Obama to get things done, while conservative activists within the party are pushing for the repeal of Obamacare and other nonstarters. Republican policy experts suggest that the party will have to manage this balance by putting out its own governing agenda, working with Obama where possible, and taking the bigger fights to the voters in 2016.\n\nThe Republican Party is also facing internal tensions, with conservative activists pushing for big fights with Obama and the GOP Senate doing everything it can to repeal Obamacare, fight regulations, and hold the line against immigration reform. It remains to be seen how the Republican Party will navigate these internal tensions and balance cooperation with Obama with the demands of their conservative base.",
    " Title: Sen. Jeff Flake Open to Changing Stance on Expanding Gun Background Checks\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake has expressed his willingness to reconsider his opposition to expanding background checks for firearm purchases, provided that changes are made to a provision in the current Senate bill regarding internet sales. Flake voted against the bill due to concerns about the cost and inconvenience of the background check requirement for internet sales, particularly in rural areas where guns are often exchanged among friends.\n\nFlake stated that under the current measure, a casual sale initiated through a text, email, or social media post would be considered a commercial sale, making it inconvenient and costly for rural residents. He admitted that the bill's chief sponsor, Senator Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), may not be able to alter the language to satisfy his concerns, but Flake expressed hope that they can find a solution.\n\nThe legislation, if passed, would have expanded the requirement for background checks on internet sales and private sales at gun shows. However, a Senate Democratic leadership aide stated on Monday that they do not anticipate or expect a deal on background checks to be reached in time for the bill to be reconsidered during this work period, which ends before Memorial Day weekend.\n\nSenator Flake, a first-term senator, has been a target of gun control group protests during the recent congressional recess. One such group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, sent a woman whose son was a victim of the Aurora movie massacre to try to meet with Flake in his Phoenix office.\n\nFlake, who is close with former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who, along with her husband, had been lobbying Flake to support expanding background checks, was publicly criticized by them following his vote against the measure. Some Republicans opposed the measure out of fear that expanding background checks would lead to a national gun registry, but Flake stated that this is not his concern.\n\n\"I know that is not what this bill does, just the opposite,\" Flake said. During last week's congressional recess, Flake was the target of gun control group protests. Despite facing criticism and being labeled as the most unpopular senator in the country in a Democratic polling firm's survey, Flake stated that he received positive feedback from his constituents for opposing the background check measure as it was written.\n\n\"I'm comfortable with where I am, pond scum or not,\" he said with a smile.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Efforts to Avert Sequestration Cuts and Pursue Budget Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nTop Democrats and Republicans have been trading blame for the $85 billion in sequestration cuts that took effect on Friday, but both parties have expressed a willingness to negotiate a comprehensive budget deal. The federal budget standoff, which began on Friday, has opened an opportunity for a \"big deal\" that addresses politically sensitive issues such as entitlement reform and tax code overhaul, which have eluded Washington for the past two years.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) stated on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that a \"big deal\" could be achieved with leadership. He expressed his unwillingness to engage in small deals and reiterated that he would not accept tax rate hikes to resolve the sequestration issue. However, he is open to a major agreement that would raise approximately $600 billion in revenue by closing tax loopholes and eliminating deductions. This revenue could then be used to reform Medicare and other entitlement programs.\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin (D-IL), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, also expressed optimism about the opportunity to find a sensible solution. He stated that both parties must agree on how to finish the fiscal year, creating an opportunity for leaders to collaborate and find a lasting solution.\n\nThe deadline for achieving such a deal is at the end of March, as the resolution funding federal government operations expires then. This means another showdown, this time to avoid a Washington shutdown, is imminent.\n\nBoth parties have until the end of March to achieve a deal, and if they fail to do so, Congress will have to approve another short-term spending plan by March 27 or face a government shutdown. Another debate over the debt ceiling is also expected in May.\n\nTop Republicans in the House and Senate have reiterated their opposition to further tax increases. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-OH) stated that the White House should not expect any more concessions on taxes after the New Year's deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) echoed these sentiments, stating that no Republican is willing to raise a dime in taxes to turn off the sequester.\n\nThe top Republican lawmakers made these comments after the White House indicated a willingness to go around the GOP leadership in the House and Senate. National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, who appeared on multiple Sunday morning shows, stated that the president spent part of Saturday calling lawmakers directly in an attempt to break the sequestration logjam and find a deal.\n\nThe White House has criticized the Republican Party for its unwillingness to compromise on the revenue question. National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling refuted the notion that congressional Republicans scored a political victory with sequestration and the administration's inability to stop it. He stated that the only \"win,\" if it can be called that, is for those on the Republican side who are willing to let all the harm be inflicted so they can stand by the principle that there should not be one dime of deficit reduction that should ever come from closing loopholes or deductions.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Recall Election Breaks Fundraising Records, Exceeding $70 Million\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing gubernatorial recall election in Wisconsin is breaking fundraising records, with a projected final tally of $70 million to $80 million. This surpasses the previous record of $37 million set just 18 months ago when Republican Governor Scott Walker was first elected.\n\nMike McCabe, who runs Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan campaign watchdog group, predicts this range for the race's final tally. The money raised in the recall already far exceeds the state's previous record.\n\nThe disparity in fundraising between the two candidates is significant. Democrat Tom Barrett has raised just under $4 million, while Walker has raised $30.5 million. This gap can be attributed in part to a quirk in the election law that allows public officials targeted for a recall in Wisconsin to raise unlimited sums of money until the recall is formally set. In Walker's case, this was in March.\n\nA large portion of Walker's donations in the last month came from outside Wisconsin, amounting to 70% of his contributions. This influx of out-of-state donations, both large and small, has been a notable trend in the recall.\n\nIndividual contributions only tell part of the story of big bucks in Wisconsin's recall. Outside groups supporting both candidates have flooded the state with some $25 million. These groups, such as Planned Parenthood, the National Rifle Association, and labor unions, look like a who's who of Washington special interests.\n\nLabor unions, which have a significant stake in the recall due to the backlash against Walker's actions regarding collective bargaining rights for public employees, have given $8 million in traceable donations to help Barrett. It's likely unions have given much more to Democratic groups not required to disclose their donors.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association is another significant contributor, providing at least $9 million, including $1 million from GOP high roller David Koch. These groups register and advertise with names that appear to be homegrown, but many are actually national unions or Washington-based special interests.\n\nThere are also stealth super PACs whose donors are anonymous, contributing $8.5 million. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign lists eight such groups on its website, most of which are right-leaning groups trying to help Walker. One, Greater Wisconsin Committee, is trying to help push Walker out.\n\n\"Elections are being poisoned here, but the people of Wisconsin can't know who is paying for most of the poison,\" McCabe said.\n\nDespite the massive amounts of money raised and spent on the recall election, it is an open question whether it will make a real difference. Wisconsin's electorate is so polarized that public and party polls suggest most people's minds are already made up. However, both parties agree that the extra campaign cash does help where it matters most: identifying voters and making sure they get to the polls on Election Day.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Allows Debt Ceiling Vote Without Conditions, Sperling Hopes for Consensus on Default Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nGene Sperling, director of President Obama's National Economic Council, expressed hope on Tuesday that the tactic of using government default or the full faith and credit of the United States as a bargaining chip in budget debates is no longer on the table. The hope stems from House Speaker John Boehner's decision to allow a vote to increase the government's borrowing cap without attaching conditions sought by some Republican legislators.\n\nDuring a breakfast meeting with reporters, Sperling, who is set to leave the White House next month, expressed his hope that the country has reached a consensus on this matter. He stated, \"We as a country have now reached a consensus that... the tactic of threatening default or threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for budget debates is over, off the table, and never to happen again.\"\n\nBoehner's decision to allow a vote on the debt ceiling, as soon as Tuesday evening, without any legislative strings attached, is a reversal from his plan announced Monday evening. The previous plan linked raising the debt ceiling to reversing a measure that cut pension benefits to younger military retirees. Now, Boehner stated, \"We'll let the Democrats put the votes up. We'll put a minimum number of [GOP] votes up to get it passed.\"\n\nThe change in plan came after conservative House Republicans expressed dissatisfaction with the linkage in Boehner's initial plan. Repealing the pension measure would have cost $7 billion over the coming decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) told The Associated Press, \"Right now we've got a debt-ceiling bill that increases spending, which is diametrically 180 degrees opposite of what we were battling over just two years ago \u2013 where the question was how much in spending cuts we were going to get.\"\n\nThe Obama administration is \"supportive of efforts to grandfather current recipients\" of the pension benefits, Sperling said. However, the White House is opposed to using the debt limit as a \"ransom\" to pass it, he added.\n\nSperling, who is the first person to serve two presidents as director of the National Economic Council, compared his service in the Clinton and Obama administrations, stressing the differences in the Republican Party then and now. \"In the Clinton administration, what was often most difficult was having [to go up against] a unified and strong opposition,\" Sperling said. \"This time around, you learn the challenges of having a divided opposition when you want to get things done.\" Even when parts of the opposition leadership today want to reach a budget agreement, \"it is hard for them to stay at the table because [their members] are not unified enough to stay at the table and finish an agreement.\"\n\nMaterial from The Associated Press was used in this report.",
    " Title: North Carolina Governor Blames Congress for Lack of Federal Civil Rights Laws, Cites Inconsistency in State and Local Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, under fire for signing a bill that requires transgender residents to use bathrooms corresponding to their sex at birth, has blamed Congress for not updating the nation's civil rights laws. In an interview with TIME, the Republican governor stated that the patchwork of non-discrimination laws at state and local levels is inconsistent, and the Civil Rights Act could resolve contradictions over discrimination in schools, businesses, and government buildings.\n\nMcCrory, who is facing a tough re-election bid this November, also vowed to continue his fight against President Barack Obama's orders that schools allow transgender students to pick their own restrooms or face a cutoff of federal dollars. \"As a country, Congress needs to step up and clarify the Civil Rights Act, which hasn't been updated for decades,\" McCrory said by phone on Wednesday. \"A lot of things have changed since then, including the Supreme Court decision on gay marriage. There's been dramatic change.\"\n\nCongress is considering a comprehensive non-discrimination law that would add protections to LGBT Americans. The Equality Act has attracted supporters from both parties, but it's unlikely to make its way to the President's desk before he leaves office early next year. McCrory said he is aware of that legislation but didn't know enough about it to endorse it. However, he said it's time for Congress to do something on the issue of discrimination. \"Congress has been sitting on the sidelines,\" he said. \"Every city and state and town has its own non-discrimination ordinances that are very inconsistent.\"\n\nMcCrory signed legislation that undid one of those local policies. Charlotte, N.C., was among the last major American cities to adopt such a measure\u2014decades after Minneapolis passed the first one in 1975. Some in the GOP are left scratching their heads over why these are controversial. \"Non-discrimination laws belong at the federal level and they have not been updated,\" McCrory said.\n\nLGBT rights advocates have been tough on McCrory and the Republican-led legislature, urging them to scrap a law that, by some estimates, has cost the state's economy $500 million. Corporate America is lined up against the measure, too, and have recruited conservative mega-attorney Ted Olsen to write a friends-of-the-court brief on their behalf.\n\nMcCrory said the Left started this fight, and have proved effective opponents. He met recently with the president of the nation's largest LGBT group, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), and came away calling him \"Machiavellian.\" \"Chad [Griffin] was extremely assertive and told me exactly what the campaign was going to entail. He has followed through,\" McCrory said. \"He said he was going to make North Carolina the epicenter of the transgender bathroom rights issue. He was going to bring activists from outside to protest, he was going to bring teams to North Carolina to coordinate protest.\"\n\nGriffin has, and it has found some success. \"From across the country, the response has been yes, we're with you,\" Griffin said of the corporate allies. That has left McCrory dangling. \"He's found himself on a very lonely island when it comes to defining a legacy based on bathrooms,\" Griffin said.\n\nEntertainers have announced boycotts until the law is changed, and some Mayors and Governors have banned official travel to North Carolina. McCrory called it hypocrisy, and cited a transgender American Airlines employee, Candis Cox-Daniels, whom he met. McCrory later posited how she would fare in New York state, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo has banned most state employees from going to North Carolina.\n\n\"New York does not allow Candis Cox to change her birth certificate. North Carolina does,\" McCrory said. \"Our laws are stronger than New York's laws.\" That is little consolation to Cox-Daniels, who is telecommuting to her job at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. Her corporate counsel has advised her not to go to her workplace because it falls under the law that would require her to use the men's room. And North Carolina's birth certificate policy is only available to those who can prove they have had reassignment surgery, which can be medically dangerous, costly, and unnecessary.\n\n\"This was not an issue that I had even heard of. We did not seek out this issue,\" McCrory said. \"The HRC, I give them credit. They are more powerful than the NRA.\" But with Obama's orders, this now should move beyond a question of North Carolina, the Governor said. \"The President has the power to enforce the law, under our Constitution, but he does not have the authority to make or interpret the law,\" he said. \"It's now a national issue that impacts every business in the United States, every university in the United States, every K-12 school in the United States. This goes way beyond North Carolina.\"\n\n\"The Right is often criticized\u2014and rightly so\u2014for wanting to getting involved in the bedrooms,\" he added. \"The Left is wanting to get involved in locker rooms, showers, and bathrooms. It was working pretty well when we were just dealing with it.... I don't think government should tell the private sector what their locker room, shower room, and bathroom policies should be.\" But that is, however, what the North Carolina law did for its public buildings. \"There is selective outrage by the corporate media and entertainment elite,\" he said. \"There is a lot of learning and a lot of confusion and complexities that both sides aren't talking about.\"",
    " Title: Churches Adapt to Coronavirus: Bible Verses, Live Streaming, and Precautionary Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the growing concern over the spread of the coronavirus, some Christians are turning to Bible verses such as 2 Timothy 1:7 to alleviate the mounting panic. The verse reads, \"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\"\n\nAside from spiritual solace, houses of worship are implementing practical solutions to limit the potential spread of COVID-19 within faith communities. For instance, DC officials are urging parishioners who attend Christ Church Georgetown to self-quarantine after its lead preacher tested positive for coronavirus. The church had already suspended services and activities as a precaution. The preacher, the Rev. Timothy Cole, remains hospitalized in stable condition in a Washington-area hospital, while his wife and two kids are in self-quarantine.\n\nIn a preventive measure, the Holy See has opted for live streaming masses to show solidarity with those affected by the virus. Pope Francis delivered mass via video on Monday, and the live stream was intended to demonstrate unity with those suffering from the virus. The Vatican also discouraged large crowds from gathering in St. Peter's Square over the weekend, with Pope Francis briefly appearing at the iconic window to wave to the sparse crowd.\n\nFrance, neighboring Italy, now has the second most coronavirus cases in Europe. In response, the government announced it will ban gatherings exceeding 1,000 people, which could potentially affect Paris Christian Center, which welcomed fifteen new converts at its weekend service. Doroth\u00e9e Rajiah, senior pastor of Paris Christian Center, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News contributing correspondent Chuck Holton, \"Many churches have decided to close their services.\" If the government asks them to shut down their service, they are ready to stream from their website and YouTube.\n\nIn Greenwood Village, Colorado, parishioners at St. Peter Lutheran Church have replaced traditional handshakes with elbow and fist bumps during the Passing of the Peace.

    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Same-Sex Marriage: Impact on Religious Liberty and Potential Civil Disobedience\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has declared that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry in all 50 states, following the historical decision on marriage. The ruling, which has already been upheld in 36 states and the District of Columbia, will no longer allow the remaining 14 states to maintain their traditional definitions of marriage.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Christian leaders have expressed a range of emotions, including love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience. Former governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee described the ruling as \"an out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny.\" Bob Vander Plaats, a conservative activist in Iowa, stated that the court \"succumbed to demands to invent a new constitutional 'right' never imagined by our Founders.\"\n\nThe impact of the gay marriage ruling on religious liberty is a topic of concern for many Christian leaders. Austin Nimocks, Senior Legal Counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, shared his perspective on the matter. Rev. Albert Mohler, the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, urged followers to \"speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth.\"\n\nMany faith leaders believe the Supreme Court ruling recognizing gay marriage will put religious liberty at risk. Jim Campbell, Senior Legal Counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, stated, \"The Supreme Court has stripped all Americans of our freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. The freedom to democratically address the most pressing social issues of the day is the heart of liberty.\"\n\nIn the weeks before the ruling, the Southern Baptist Convention partnered with the Alliance Defending Freedom to provide guidance for churches and other faith-based institutions called Protecting Your Ministry. Dr. Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, discussed the booklet in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 News earlier this month.\n\nRev. Samuel Rodriguez stated that the decision \"serves as a de facto and legal catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview.\" Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, has already called for civil disobedience in response to such a ruling. Other individuals and organizations are studying the ruling to determine the best ways to respond.",
    " Title: May's Brexit Deal: A Closer Look at the Controversial Agreement and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May announced the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union (EU) in the House of Commons earlier this week, following months of negotiations. The deal, which spans over 500 pages, has been met with mixed reactions, with few having read it in full.\n\nThe agreement confirms earlier leaks, stating that after leaving the EU, Britain will continue to be subject to EU rules and regulations, but will have no say or vote in their creation. This has raised concerns among Brexit supporters, as it appears to contradict the \"red lines\" set by Prime Minister May last year.\n\nRed Lines vs. Deal:\n\n1. Red Line: Britain will leave the single market and its regulations.\n   Deal: Britain will sign on to a \"common rulebook\" of regulations, which will be the EU single-market rulebook.\n\n2. Red Line: Britain will leave the Customs Union to negotiate free-trade deals with non-EU countries.\n   Deal: Britain will remain in a customs union with the EU, making it impossible to negotiate free-trade deals with other countries.\n\n3. Red Line: Britain will be out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\n   Deal: Britain will be subject to ECJ jurisdiction on regulation and trade matters, and U.K. courts will take account of its rulings.\n\nPrime Minister May maintains that she has achieved the Brexit deal she wanted, despite the apparent contradictions. However, this claim has been met with criticism from Brexit supporters, who argue that the deal amounts to an outright betrayal.\n\nThe deal's opponents, including former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are calling for a vote of no confidence in May, as they believe that if the leader won't change the deal, they must change the leader.\n\nSupporters of the deal, often referred to as \"covert Remainers,\" argue that it is the best achievable Brexit, even potentially leading to a second referendum and the maintenance of EU membership. They accept that the deal may be unsatisfactory but argue that Brexit is an impossible \"fantasy.\"\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionists, whose support gives the May government its parliamentary majority, have also expressed opposition to the deal, as it places a border within the U.K. to avoid one between the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. This threatens the Union\u2014not the European Union but the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nPrime Minister May and her loyalist supporters now face three linked challenges: a possible leadership vote, a possible parliamentary defeat on the EU-U.K. deal, and a possible election to resolve the Brexit issue. The crisis has led to several cabinet ministers resigning, and at least half the required 48 letters for a vote of confidence have been publicly submitted.\n\nThe outcome of this political crisis remains uncertain, but it is clear that the deal has sparked significant controversy and division within the Conservative Party and the British government. The Tories may need to choose a new leader to forge a new policy and achieve a real Brexit. At present, they are sleepwalking into vassalage, as the deal appears to contradict the will of the British people as expressed in the 2016 referendum.",
    " Title: Louisiana Election Results: John Bel Edwards Defeats David Vitter, Shifts Political Landscape in Deep South\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in the political landscape of the conservative Deep South, State Rep. John Bel Edwards has defeated Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter in Saturday's election. Edwards will be the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, where Republicans dominate politically.\n\nThe election night parties of the candidates provided a clear indication of the outcome. Sen. David Vitter was based at a hotel near the airport, while John Bel Edwards lodged in the historic Monteleone Hotel in the French Quarter. A brass band led a second line through the packed ballroom, with revelers waving yellow campaign hankies, signaling Edwards' victory.\n\nDemocrats have much to celebrate in a state where they have been shut out of statewide elected office. Edwards attributes this change to his supporters who, he says, \"were willing to believe that we could confound the conventional wisdom that this victory just couldn't happen.\"\n\nInitially, Republican Sen. David Vitter was the presumed frontrunner. By last night, he was conceding defeat and preparing for an exit from the U.S. Senate. Vitter stated, \"I'm only going to be doing that for one more year though this term,\" referring to his Senate tenure. He had decided to pursue new challenges outside the Senate regardless of the election outcome, citing he had reached his personal term limit.\n\nVitter's ties to a Washington D.C. prostitute in 2007 were a recurring issue in the governor's race. At the time, he confessed to a \"serious sin,\" and then handily won re-election to the Senate in 2010. However, the governor's race was different, with Edwards and his supporters attacking Vitter's character at every turn with harsh language, labeling him a liar and a stain on Louisiana.\n\nVitter also had to overcome voters' frustration with the current Republican Governor, Bobby Jindal, who is term-limited. Louisiana's other Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy supported Vitter, but some other GOP officeholders backed Edwards. Cassidy acknowledges that this division within the Republican party hurt Vitter's campaign.\n\n\"Clearly Republicans were fractured, and there was a multimillion-dollar superPAC attacking David. For whatever reason, their attacks had a bite,\" he says.\n\nState Rep. Kenny Havard is among those who broke GOP ranks to endorse Edwards. He views the election as a message that voters are tired of ultra-partisan politics. \"We've got people on the fringe of each party, you know they rule the party. And probably 80 percent of us are stuck in the middle with nowhere to go. So I think the people of Louisiana spoke tonight and spoke with a loud voice,\" Havard said.\n\nEdwards, a veteran and West Point graduate, stakes out some conservative turf\u2014he's anti-abortion and pro-gun rights. However, he also plans to expand Medicaid and push for a higher minimum wage, issues popular with Louisiana Democrats. Edwards promised last night to be a governor for \"all the people.\" With one final punch, he added, \"I will never embarrass you.\"",
    " Title: Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect's Interrogation and Charges Remain Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nThe surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has yet to provide law enforcement authorities with substantial information due to medical issues, as he has been in and out of consciousness since his apprehension on Friday evening, according to The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, new circumstantial evidence suggests that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, may have radicalized Dzhokhar and influenced him into the alleged bomb plot. Tamerlan was killed in the brothers' getaway attempt on Friday.\n\nIn January, Tamerlan Tsarnaev interrupted a speaker at a Cambridge mosque who compared the prophet Muhammad and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., according to The Boston Globe. The elder Tsarnaev brother called the speaker at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque a nonbeliever, a \"kaffir,\" and accused him of contaminating people's minds. The congregation did not agree and \"shouted him out of the mosque,\" Yusufi Vali, a spokesman for the mosque, told the Globe.\n\nYounger brother Dzhokhar may be unable to communicate with investigators even after recovery, as he sustained a wound to the throat area. It is unclear whether the wound was the result of police gunfire or was self-inflicted as part of a failed suicide attempt. Authorities indicated that the federal High Value Detainee Interrogation team was standing by to question the surviving Tsarnaev in writing if possible.\n\nMr. Tsarnaev could be charged at any time. As legal expert Robert Chesney notes on the \"Lawfare\" blog, law enforcement faces no shortage of possible crimes to use in its indictment. Charges could be state or federal. \"Many if not most will be ordinary violent-crimes charges rather than terrorism-specific ones \u2013 though they'll be no less potent for that,\" writes Mr. Chesney.\n\nThe most serious charge Tsarnaev might face is federal: use of a weapon of mass destruction in killing. It can carry the death penalty. However, the \"Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction\" statute carries four conditions, one of which must be met for it to apply. The first two conditions, which generally hold that the alleged attack affects mail delivery or property used in interstate or foreign commerce, may not be applicable. The third, which holds that the perpetrator of the attack travels across state or national boundaries in furtherance of the crime, might fit. So might the fourth, which says that the offense must \"affect interstate or foreign commerce\" itself.\n\nAnother federal terrorism statute that can carry a capital charge and may be applicable is titled \"Acts of Terrorism Transcending National Boundaries.\" If authorities believe some element of the plot began overseas, they could invoke this law. It is possible they suspect just that, given that the elder Tsarnaev traveled to Russia for six months in 2011, where he may have met with radical Islamists or received some terrorist training.\n\nOther federal terrorism laws that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev might face charges from include a statute dealing with the bombing of public places and another prohibiting material support for terror acts.\n\nThere is some question as to whether Tsarnaev's trial might be moved outside Massachusetts, on the grounds that any jury pool would be tainted against him. After all, Timothy McVeigh's trial for the Oklahoma City bombing was moved to Colorado for that reason. State authorities are likely to file their own charges against the terror suspect, meaning that at some point he is quite likely to face a Bay State jury.\n\nOn Monday, civil libertarians continued to criticize the Obama administration for its decision to delay reading Tsarnaev his Miranda rights so that it can ask initial questions under a public safety exception to the law. Given the weight of evidence against Tsarnaev, this action is unlikely to have any practical effect on his future trial, note experts. Authorities have so much video, so many tapes, and lots of physical evidence, including explosives, that they would not need to use Tsarnaev's initial statements in any trial, and thus would not need to risk the statements being excluded on legal grounds.",
    " Title: Orlando Mass Killing Fits Pattern of Homegrown Terrorism, According to Peter Bergen\n\nArticle:\n\nPeter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America, and a professor of practice at Arizona State University, has written that the mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern of homegrown terrorism in the United States.\n\nSince the 9/11 attacks, every lethal terrorist attack on U.S. soil has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, with no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.\n\nMany Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens. However, Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen born in New York to parents who immigrated from Afghanistan.\n\nSince 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives has been the exception, rather than the rule. The real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.\n\nIn other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the United States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Recall Vote: A Battle for Home Turf and Statewide Expansion\n\nArticle:\n\nWisconsin residents are casting their votes today in the historic recall election for the state's governor, with potential implications beyond the state's borders. The focus of this election is primarily on the 3 million-plus registered voters within Wisconsin, rather than the broader political implications for 2012.\n\nThe recall election is, in many ways, a replay of the 2010 gubernatorial election, which Republican Scott Walker won by approximately 125,000 votes among over 2 million cast. Democratic challenger Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee since 2004, is aiming to translate his mayoral popularity into a stronger showing than his 2010 performance, particularly in his home county and metro area.\n\nIn 2010, Barrett won his own city proper in a landslide, enabling him to carry Milwaukee County by a little over 80,000 votes. However, Walker, who was the chief elected official for Milwaukee County at the time, countered the city's vote and kept the countywide margin close to where it had been in 2006, when Democratic Governor Jim Doyle was re-elected.\n\nIn 2006, Doyle rode the Milwaukee County vote to a narrow win for the overall Milwaukee metro area, superseding the usual Republican blowout in the suburban-exurban counties of Waukesha, Washington, and Ozaukee to the west and north. In 2010, with turnout down dramatically in the city of Milwaukee, Barrett found that the vote in surrounding counties had grown insurmountable.\n\nMeanwhile, the vote was going heavily against him in the rest of the metro. Waukesha County alone favored Walker by about 82,000 votes, slightly more than the margin by which Barrett won Milwaukee County. Ozaukee and Washington came piling on, going for Walker by a combined ratio approaching 3-to-1, putting the Republican nearly 50,000 votes ahead for the four-county metro area.\n\nFor his part, Walker was running up big margins in the traditional Republican enclaves in the eastern half of the state, from Walworth in the south to Dodge, Fond du Lac, and Winnebago in the east-central part of the state. He had little trouble winning the swing county of Brown, which includes the city of Green Bay.\n\nIn Tuesday's recall, Barrett needs to get much closer to Obama's numbers in the Milwaukee metro, find a way to squeeze even more votes out of Dane and widen his winning margin in outstate counties such as Eau Claire. It would also help if he could flip counties he lost in 2010, including southeastern Racine and Kenosha near the Illinois state line.\n\nThis tall order explains why even the late polls showing the race getting closer are not shaking the confidence of the governor and his backers. The votes to be counted Tuesday night are likely to follow traditional partisan patterns that have been discernible in the state since the emergence of its modern Democratic Party in the years after World War II.",
    " Title: U.S.-Led Coalition's Progress Against Islamic State Challenged by Political and Military Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry declared on Sunday that the U.S.-led coalition, working with Arab partners, has made significant progress in the fight against Islamic State terrorists, taking back wide swaths of territory and eliminating top commanders. However, this rosy outlook is met with skepticism from Kurdish leaders and Republican critics who question the U.S. leadership's strategy and commitment.\n\nKerry stated that the coalition has made substantial progress, citing the retaking of territory and the elimination of key Islamic State commanders. He expressed confidence in the coalition's victory, stating, \"I absolutely do [believe they are winning]...And I think the evidence is not in my saying it, but it\u2019s in the facts of what is happening.\"\n\nHowever, Kurdish leaders involved in the ground combat have expressed concerns about the lack of a clear strategy to rout the extremists. U.S. lawmakers from both parties have also voiced concerns about the U.S. not doing enough to support their allies without deploying American troops.\n\nThe disconnect between the U.S. administration's assessment and that of those on the ground highlights the challenges the administration faces in navigating real-life battles abroad and political ones at home. The Islamic State's jihadist-inspired violence, including the brutal immolation of a Jordanian pilot and the suspected killing of American hostage Kayla Mueller, has fueled fears over the tangible and philosophical threats of radical Islam.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, political tensions are running high in Washington, with members of both parties warning about the growing threat of homegrown terrorism. The Department of Homeland Security's funding is set to run out on February 27 due to a stalemate over President Obama's executive amnesty for certain illegal immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has urged for a fully funded department to ensure public safety.\n\nWhile some Republicans express concern about picking the wrong fight, hard-liners argue that the DHS can maintain the country's safety during a partial shutdown. Others criticize the administration for not setting clear goals and for failing to define the enemy as radical Islamist extremism.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the domestic political tensions, the U.S. is also facing challenges in Ukraine, where the administration is being urged to arm the Kiev government, which is battling Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country. Attempts at a truce have faltered, and the administration has been reluctant to disclose what assistance they will provide to Ukrainian loyalists.\n\nRepublican senators, including Sen. John McCain and Sen. Ted Cruz, have expressed concerns about the administration's foreign policy, with Cruz suggesting that diplomacy may not be enough and that the U.S. needs to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters on the front lines. The administration maintains that it has already supplied the peshmerga with ammunition, weapons, and other resources.\n\nThe battle against the Islamic State ultimately needs to be waged by the Iraqi army, although they are not yet prepared to fight, according to Kerry. He emphasized that the coalition believes everything, including the governing process in Iraq, is moving in the right direction.",
    " Title: Same-sex Marriage and Religious Liberty: A Balancing Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe debate over same-sex marriage has a strong religious component, as highlighted by Marc Stern, a prominent legal scholar and former president of the American Jewish Congress. Stern argues that the government should not favor one religious view over another on the issue of gay marriage.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing debate, Stern raises questions such as whether recognizing gay marriage infringes upon religious liberty. The debate involves interpreting biblical passages, reconciling ancient texts with modern theological understanding, and considering the importance of love and human autonomy as religious values.\n\nStern emphasizes that the U.S. Supreme Court should not be tasked with determining the religious stance on same-sex marriage. Religious groups are divided on this issue, with some supporting and others opposing same-sex marriage. Even if a religious viewpoint were clear, it should not influence the constitutional requirement for states or the federal government to recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nStern argues that neither the court nor government should referee religious disputes. Under the Constitution, religious groups are free to advocate for their differing visions of morality and compete in the marketplace of ideas. Winners and losers are determined by individual and congregational beliefs, not by government bodies.\n\nCitizens opposed to same-sex marriage cannot demand that the government refuse recognition to such marriages to avoid offending their religious sensibilities.\n\nReligious liberty, as Stern points out, does not grant anyone the right to deny others the \"right to live the most intimate portions of their lives according to their own deepest convictions.\" However, when government recognizes same-sex marriage, it creates new challenges for the liberties of religious believers.\n\nThese challenges extend to questions such as whether religious leaders must provide religious marriage counseling to same-sex couples, whether religious colleges must provide housing to same-sex couples, or whether churches and synagogues must employ spouses in same-sex marriages. Resolving these conflicts will not be easy, and Stern suggests that in some instances, the rights of same-sex couples will unavoidably trump religious liberty rights. Conversely, in other cases, religious liberty will trump, and same-sex couples may have to accept that not everyone accepts their relationships as legitimate.\n\nStern concludes by stating that same-sex couples should not be denied the right to civil marriage, but they should not, without good reason, be allowed to force dissenting religious organizations to recognize or facilitate their marriages.",
    " Title: Texas Gubernatorial Candidate Wendy Davis' Ad Sparks Controversy Over Attack on Paraplegic Opponent Greg Abbott\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Texas gubernatorial race, Democratic candidate Wendy Davis has released a controversial ad that focuses on her Republican opponent, Greg Abbott, and the accident that left him in a wheelchair. The ad, titled \"Justice,\" has sparked criticism from both political opponents and media personalities.\n\nThe 30-second spot, released on Friday, notes that Abbott received millions of dollars in a lawsuit after his accident in 1984, but accuses him of not siding with victims like himself during his time in the state Supreme Court or as the Texas attorney general.\n\nMSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" co-host Mika Brzezinski expressed her disapproval of the ad during a discussion on Monday, stating, \"I cringed watching that.\" She further commented that the ad goes against Davis' \"brand\" and her positive message.\n\nDespite the criticism, Davis has defended the ad, stating that Abbott has tried to block cases similar to his own. She told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio over the weekend, \"He rightfully had an opportunity to access the justice system when he was at the receiving end of a tragic accident, but ever since he's been actively fighting to close that door and deny access to others who have been wronged and who deserve to have their day in court.\"\n\nDavis' pollster, Joel Benenson, also defended the ad, stating that it is effective and aligns with their campaign strategy. However, Republican strategists argue that the ad is backfiring, with Abbott's camp releasing a video on Monday about the mounting complaints on Davis' ad, stating that she is \"unfit to be governor.\"\n\nAssociate professor at Columbia University, Dorian Warren, told \"The Morning Joe\" show that the ad is a \"huge blunder,\" as Davis, who is losing to Abbott by double digits in state and national polls, is trying to attract voters. Warren stated, \"What Wendy Davis needs is to increase voter turnout. Negative ads depress voter turnout. She needs many new voters to come out, and this will not motivate her voters to come out.\"\n\nAbbott himself has expressed his disapproval of the ad, stating that it is \"offensive\" and \"shows the tenor of the campaign.\" He also expects the strategy to backfire, stating, \"It's her choice if she wants to attack a guy in a wheelchair. I don't think it's going to sell too well.\"\n\nTexas GOP Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. Ted Cruz have also expressed their disapproval of the ad, with Cornyn stating that it is \"way over the line\" and calling on Davis to apologize and pull down the ad. The ad has also drawn criticism from Texas Republican lawmakers and media strategists, with some comparing it unfavorably to Todd Akin's controversial comments during the 2012 Missouri Senate race.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Deployment to Southern Border Aims to Assist, Not Stop, Migrant Caravan\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Defense has ordered 800 soldiers to the southern border to assist with the influx of migrants from Central America, as a caravan of approximately 10,000 individuals, primarily from Honduras, makes its way towards the United States. The military presence is not intended to stop the caravan but to support Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Health and Human Services, and other authorities as they process the newcomers.\n\nThe caravan, organized by the group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, is a challenge to national sovereignty, as it represents an unauthorized march towards the U.S. border. The group's goal, in part, is to undermine the concept of sovereignty, as they bear the flag of their homeland rather than the country they seek to enter.\n\nThe military's role is to provide logistical and administrative support, not to enforce immigration laws. The government's ability to turn back the tide of illegal immigration is limited due to the same rule of law that incentivizes and protects the illegal immigrants within the caravan.\n\nCongress, however, has the authority to address the issue by closing the loopholes that have facilitated recent illegal migration. These loopholes include provisions of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, the 1997 Flores settlement, and the \"credible fear\" standard for asylum requests.\n\nThe character of illegal immigration has changed in recent years. While the population of Mexicans living illegally in the United States has declined, the overall figure has stabilized due to rising living standards in Mexico and improved immigration enforcement. The new illegal immigration is primarily families fleeing violence and instability in Central America, rather than single males seeking economic opportunities in the United States.\n\nThe changing nature of illegal immigration was first evident in the child migration crisis of 2014, and the election of Donald Trump has not significantly reduced illegal border crossings. The first caravan of this year is just one example of the ongoing issue.\n\nThe humanitarian instinct is a powerful force in American immigration policy, but it has unintentionally contributed to a mounting crisis that benefits no nation. The desire to help strangers has led to inadequate responses to the issue, and calls for congressional action are growing louder.\n\nAmending the 2008 law to accelerate repatriations, addressing Flores in legislation that permits indefinite detention of family units, and tightening asylum standards are among the solutions being proposed. Providing more funding for resources to speed up legal proceedings and announcing a clear, unequivocal stance on immigration policy may help address the issue more effectively.\n\nIn addition, the construction of a border wall remains a contentious topic in the ongoing debate on immigration policy. Regardless of one's stance on the wall, it is clear that the current situation requires a comprehensive, congressionally-led solution.",
    " Title: Obama Aims to Shift Discourse and Present Vision for Second Term in Acceptance Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his acceptance speech for the Democratic Party's renomination, President Barack Obama will seek to transition from a message of hope and change to one of progress and accomplishment. However, due to an anticipated jobs report the following day showing U.S. unemployment above 8 percent for the 43rd consecutive month, Obama will avoid sounding triumphant.\n\nMartin Medhurst, a professor of political science and rhetoric at Baylor University, explains, \"In an acceptance situation, you want to paint a bright picture of all the wonderful things that have happened over the past four years.\" While good things have indeed occurred during Obama's term, the economic situation makes it challenging for him to present a particularly bright picture.\n\nAside from criticizing his opponent, Republican Mitt Romney, Obama's main tasks include convincing voters that another four years in office will lead to further achievements. Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, points to several accomplishments Obama is likely to highlight: bailing out the domestic auto industry, expanding health coverage for millions of Americans, reshaping the student loan business, ending the war in Iraq, winding down the war in Afghanistan, and authorizing the mission that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nRybak asserts, \"He's delivered and is going to deliver a lot more than Mitt Romney can ever dream of doing.\" Attacks on Romney's platform will be a recurring theme in Obama's speech, as he seeks to frame the election as a choice rather than a referendum on his own record.\n\nGeorge C. Edwards III, a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University, suggests that Obama will argue that a Romney administration would jeopardize the middle class. Obama will also draw parallels with Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 renomination acceptance speech, portraying himself as an advocate for the middle class while depicting Romney as favoring the wealthy.\n\nRaising the stakes by painting a dire picture of a Romney presidency may help energize the Democratic base, which has been less enthusiastic about this election compared to Obama's 2008 campaign. David Woodard, a Republican consultant and professor at Clemson University, states, \"He's been president for four years, and I'm not sure the average person right now could answer the question, 'What does Barack Obama want to do in a second term that would have a better result?'\"\n\nThe theme of the Democratic National Convention has been \"Forward.\" Obama will need to answer the question, \"Forward to what?\" Michael Waldman, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school, explains, \"The challenge for Obama is that he needs to put out, much more than he has, a strong vision for what he wants to do in a second term.\"\n\nThis vision should not be an idealized vision of what Obama would do if Democrats had complete control, but rather, a realistic depiction of what people could expect from him if elected for a second term.",
    " Title: Unpopular Candidates: A Look at the 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe current state of the 2016 presidential race, as summarized by a recent headline in the Los Angeles Times, poses a question: \"A Trump-Clinton general election poses a question: Which one does America hate less?\" The two presumptive candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are generally disliked by most voters, consistently recording negative favorability ratings this year.\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican candidate, has been successful in the primaries, winning 27 delegates in the Republican primary in Washington state on May 24th. However, he is the most unpopular candidate overall in recent times. According to YouGov's latest poll, he is viewed unfavorably across various demographic groups, including gender, age, race, and income. Clinton, while receiving more favorable ratings, is only viewed favorably by blacks and Hispanics in these categories.\n\nThe protracted primaries and party squabbles have not helped the candidates' images. Candidates often become more popular once they secure the nomination, as happened with John Kerry in 2004, and their image changes from contender to victor. This is not always the case, as Mitt Romney was viewed unfavorably throughout most of his run in 2012, only receiving a small boost once he won the Republican nomination. In September that year, two months before the election, he still had a negative favorability rating in Gallup polling, the only presidential candidate from either party to gain that distinction at that stage of campaigning since at least 1988.\n\nThis year will be different, as the race will feature not one but two unpopular candidates. Just a third of Americans have a favorable view of Donald Trump. Clinton does slightly better at 40%, but she might take heart from her husband's campaign. Bill Clinton had a negative favorability rating throughout the spring and early summer of 1992, but it jumped from 41% to 62% when the Democratic National Convention got underway. Clinton will be looking for a similar boost, contingent on Bernie Sanders' campaign, at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.",
    " Title: Multiple Police Officers Shot in Three States in Single Day\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of shootings targeting police officers occurred in three states on Sunday, resulting in the death of a 20-year veteran San Antonio police detective and injuries to several other officers. The shootings, which appear to be unconnected, involved law enforcement officers sitting unsuspectingly in their patrol cars, either waiting in traffic or after pulling vehicles over for traffic stops.\n\nIn San Antonio, Texas, a man is suspected of executing Detective Benjamin Marconi, 50, at 11:45 a.m. local time. The suspect is believed to have staked out police headquarters just hours before the shooting and briefly gained access to a vestibule of the building before quickly leaving. The man is being sought by police and is described as driving a 2009-2012 black Mitsubishi Galant with black rims.\n\nSan Antonio authorities have released video surveillance footage showing the suspect outside police headquarters. He is seen speaking to a clerk on an intercom before being let in to a vestibule, but he only stayed a short time before leaving. The suspect asked a question, but the content of the conversation remains undisclosed.\n\nFour hours later, the man is suspected of killing Marconi as he sat in his patrol car across from police headquarters, writing a traffic ticket. A vehicle thought to be driven by the suspect pulled up behind Marconi, and a man got out and shot Marconi twice in the head. The final shot was fired as the assailant reached inside Marconi's passenger window to shoot the father of two at close range.\n\nIn St. Louis, Missouri, a sergeant was shot twice in the face at 7:30 p.m. Sunday night and is expected to survive, although he is hospitalized in critical condition. The 46-year-old officer, whose name has not been released, is a married father of three and a 20-year veteran of the force.\n\nIn Sanibel, Florida, an officer was shot and injured during a similar incident when a person fired at the officer as he sat in his patrol car after finishing a traffic stop just before 8 p.m. Other officers fired back at the suspect, who was eventually taken into custody.\n\nIn Gladstone, Missouri, an officer sustained non-life-threatening injuries during a struggle with a man in his late teens who had fled from a traffic stop. During the tussle, the man revealed a handgun, shots were fired, and the teen was killed.\n\nThe shootings come less than five months after a gunman killed five officers in Dallas who were working a protest about the fatal police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement since September 11, 2001.\n\nTen days after the Dallas attack, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Earlier this month, two Des Moines, Iowa-area police officers were fatally shot in separate ambush-style attacks while sitting in their patrol cars.\n\nIn 2016, 56 state, county, and local officers have been shot while on duty.",
    " Title: Secret Service Expands Protective Detail for Trump Administration Members, Affecting New York Field Office\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Secret Service is providing round-the-clock protective details to the spouses and children of President Donald Trump's adult children, as well as several top aides, including Reince Priebus, H.R. McMaster, and Kellyanne Conway, at the president's request. This expansion of the protective detail, beyond the top officials and immediate family required by statute, is expected to ease slightly this summer with the expected cessation of regular protection for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, as well as President Obama's eldest daughter.\n\nWith several of the new protectees residing in New York, the Secret Service may eventually establish a fully staffed branch of the presidential protection division in the city, relocating agents from across the country. However, for now, as it awaits a potential move to Washington by First Lady Melania Trump and President Trump's youngest son, Barron, the agency is flying agents in from around the country, a less common practice for a routine nonelection detail. This arrangement necessitates the agency's payment for hotel rooms, transportation, and living expenses at Manhattan prices, according to the officials.\n\nThe Secret Service is also renting space inside Trump Tower for offices and temporary sleeping quarters, two officials said, though the details of the transaction have not been made public. The New York field office appears to have been particularly hard hit, with a third of the agents involved in protection on a given day. This has diminished the kind of protective intelligence, financial crime, and cybercrime cases that normally make up the bulk of their work, according to a former agency official briefed on its staffing. Such investigative work is seen within the agency as crucial to not only building agents' skills and combating crime, but also sharpening their protection abilities.\n\nJames F. Tomsheck, who left the agency in 2006 after 23 years, stated, \"Essentially the Secret Service is in a campaign mode all of the time right now. It will greatly degrade the quality of life for most agents in the Secret Service, because of increased travel, protracted periods of time away from family.\"",
    " Title: Kamala Harris' Proposed Equal Pay Policy Under Scrutiny for Methodology and Potential Burdens\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic Senator Kamala Harris, a presidential hopeful, has proposed a plan titled \"Holding Corporations Accountable for Pay Inequality in America.\" The plan aims to achieve \"equal pay for equal work,\" but the methodology used to calculate the pay gap has come under scrutiny.\n\nIn her report, Harris claims that women who work full-time are paid, on average, 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. However, this calculation is based on median earnings for all workers who work 35 hours or more a week for the full year. This methodology does not compare women with men who perform the same jobs, work the same number of hours, and have the same education.\n\nEconomist Claudia Goldin's work, whose research is widely recognized on the left, has shown that when measured properly, the remaining small pay gap is not primarily the result of discrimination. Instead, Goldin finds that women demand \"temporal flexibility,\" which refers to anything that leads to a desire for more time. This can include caring for children or aging parents, which requires more flexibility in the workplace, leading to differences in job selection for women and men.\n\nThe proposal suggests that employers with more than 100 workers would have to prove to a federal bureaucrat that they are not paying women less than men for work of equal value. If they fail to do so, they would have to pay the government \"1% of their profits for every 1% wage gap they allow to persist.\"\n\nCritics argue that this policy would create a bureaucratic nightmare, requiring businesses to prove that their employees are paid according to their performance reviews and tasks. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which Harris would task with the certification, would need to add several hundred bureaucrats to its current staff of 2,300 employees to certify everyone in a timely fashion.\n\nLabor attorneys could potentially benefit from the new litigation resulting from disagreements between the commission and businesses. The proposal could also lead to employers reducing the number of women they employ or scaling back on flexibility to minimize wage gaps, potentially infringing on workers' rights to temporal flexibility.\n\nWhile it is common for candidates on the campaign trail to propose controversial policies, this proposal has raised concerns about its methodology and potential burdens on businesses and the workforce.",

Trump was named \"Person of the Year\" in 2016.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, TIME Magazine stated that Trump's assertion about being offered the title was incorrect. \"The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year,\" the magazine tweeted. \"TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump tweeted that he had declined the offer after the magazine reached out to him, citing editorial obligations. \"Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named 'Man (Person) of the Year,' like last year,\" Trump said in his tweet. \"But I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!\"\n\nAlan Murray, chief content officer of Time Inc., also disputed Trump's claims, tweeting Friday night, \"Amazing. Not a speck of truth here.\"\n\nTrump, who won the award in 2016, took issue with the magazine's coverage that year, as the magazine published his picture on the cover with the title \"PRESIDENT OF THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA.\"\n\nIn the unofficial public poll, Trump is currently tied for third place at 5% of the vote, along with the hashtag \"#MeToo\" and \"The Dreamers\" \u2013 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US. As of this post, Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia is ranked No. 1 with 21% of the vote.",
    " Title: Trump Approved of Uighur Muslim Concentration Camps in China, According to Bolton's Memoir\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer National Security Advisor John Bolton's upcoming memoir, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" claims that President Donald Trump expressed approval of a concentration camp for Uighur Muslims in China during a private meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting took place during the 2019 G20 meeting in Japan, according to Bolton's book.\n\nIn the private meeting, which was attended only by the leaders and their interpreters, Xi reportedly explained to Trump why he was constructing concentration camps in Xinjiang. The interpreter added that Trump said Xi should proceed with building the camps, which Trump believed was the right thing to do, according to the book.\n\nBolton also wrote that Matthew Pottinger, a retired US Marine and the current deputy national security adviser, told him that Trump made a similar statement during his November 2017 trip to China.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has been criticized for constructing large concentration camps in Xinjiang, where millions of ethnic minority Uighur Muslims are believed to be detained under the guise of a counterterrorism campaign. Inside the camps, approximately 2 million to 3 million Uighur Muslims are under surveillance and subject to mandatory \"reeducation\" training.\n\nThe camps have been criticized by the White House, and lawmakers from both parties have condemned the practice. Trump recently signed a bipartisan bill, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which calls for sanctions against officials involved with the camps.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has denied the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims and claims that the allegations \"blatantly smear China's counterterrorism and deradicalization measures and seriously interfere in China's internal affairs.\"\n\nBolton's book has caused a stir in Washington and the political sphere. In the memoir, Bolton accuses the House of Representatives of \"impeachment malpractice\" and claims that Trump engaged in far more objectionable conduct than what he was impeached for.\n\nThe book also describes Trump's efforts to persuade Xi to purchase US agricultural products to help him win reelection in 2020. According to Bolton, Trump emphasized the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.\n\nBolton's book is set to be released on June 23.",
    " Title: Trump's National Security Strategy Emphasizes Economic Prosperity, Trade, and Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech on Monday, President Trump outlined a new national security strategy that places U.S. economic issues at the center of U.S. foreign policy. The strategy, which is the first comprehensive update of U.S. foreign policy since 2015, is built on four pillars: protecting the American people at home, promoting economic prosperity, preserving peace through a strong military, and advancing American interests abroad.\n\nThe strategy aims to balance competing objectives, emphasizing political and economic competition with countries like Russia and China, while also enlisting their help with security challenges like North Korea's nuclear program. Trump stated, \"While we seek such opportunities of cooperation, we will stand up for ourselves, and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before.\"\n\nIn his speech, Trump criticized his predecessors, particularly President Barack Obama, for negotiating \"disastrous trade deals,\" neglecting the North Korea crisis, making a \"bad nuclear deal\" with Iran, and allowing the Islamic State to gain a foothold in Iraq and Syria. The strategy is characterized by economic nationalism, with Trump boasting low unemployment numbers and a soaring stock market.\n\nThe strategy places more emphasis on the business climate than on climate change, a key focus of Obama's last national security strategy document. The strategy states that the United States will counter \"an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests.\" The strategy also places an emphasis on cyber-security, although it reduces the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to just a couple of lines in the written report.\n\nTrump described Russia and China as \"revisionist powers\" intent on changing the global status quo by illegitimately seizing territory. China's unique economic and military clout makes it what the report calls a \"strategic competitor.\" However, the strategy does not rule out cooperation with these countries when their interests align.\n\nIn other areas, Trump attempts to expand the concept of national security as encompassing fair trade, tax reform, and deregulation. The strategy also promotes the idea of a \"national security innovation base,\" a term coined by Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro to describe the technology and other intellectual property that gives the United States a strategic and economic advantage in the world.",
    " Title: Empathy and Compassion: A Study on Interpersonal Relations and the Impact of Personal Encounters\n\nArticle:\n\nA study conducted by sociologist Richard LaPiere in 1934, documented in the journal American Journal of Sociology, provides insight into the human tendency to exhibit more compassion and empathy towards others in personal encounters compared to abstract situations. The study involved a Chinese couple traveling across the United States, where they were met with unexpectedly minimal instances of racism, despite the prevalent overt racism against Chinese people during that time.\n\nIn the experiment, the couple was denied service only once at 251 hotels and restaurants. However, the most surprising finding was that, after the study, only one establishment indicated a willingness to serve \"members of the Chinese race.\" Ninety-two percent of the establishments stated they would not serve Chinese people, with the remaining respondents uncertain.\n\nThis study suggests that people may be more hostile towards others in abstract, theoretical situations than in personal, face-to-face interactions. This phenomenon can be observed in various aspects of society, such as the increased endorsement of gay rights when individuals realize they have gay relatives or colleagues.\n\nTo foster more compassion and empathy in America today, the article suggests adopting a proactive approach. Individuals are encouraged to emulate figures like Tommy Gunn and Hawk Newsome, inviting those perceived as \"other\" into their personal or professional spheres. Engaging in open dialogue and sharing personal experiences can help break down barriers and promote understanding.\n\nThe article further proposes a national movement of American renewal, celebrating leaders who venture into unfamiliar territory and supporting institutions dedicated to respectful ideological discourse. Additionally, it encourages supporting news outlets that combat anonymous hatred, even if it may not be financially profitable.\n\nWhile the idea of such a movement may seem radical, the study and the rally in Washington, as depicted in a YouTube video, offer evidence that it may indeed be possible to foster more compassion and empathy in society.",
    " Title: Parents Encouraged to Inquire About School Safety Plans After Georgia Elementary School Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a recent shooting at an elementary school in Decatur, Georgia, parents are being urged to take a proactive approach when it comes to their children's school safety plans. The incident, which occurred barely over a week into the new school year, involved a gunman armed with an assault rifle. Fortunately, the gunman was apprehended before any injuries or fatalities occurred.\n\nTo ensure the safety of their children, parents should ask their school administrators the following questions:\n\n1. Does the school have a crisis response plan customized for its campus?\n2. Does the school regularly practice basic school safety drills such as lockdowns, shelter-in-place, and evacuations?\n3. What should parents do in case of an emergency at the school?\n4. Have both staff and students received training on what to do during an active shooter incident?\n5. Has the school partnered with its local law enforcement agency to practice emergency response procedures?\n\nIt is crucial for schools to have a crisis response plan tailored to their unique characteristics, demographics, and personnel. Regular practice of safety drills is essential to a strong school safety plan, with most school safety experts advising campuses to practice such drills at least once per semester.\n\nParents should also be informed of their role during a school crisis, including whom to contact, where to go, and what to do upon arrival. Many school districts require proper identification for parents to pick up their child during a nontraditional release, such as an evacuation.\n\nIn addition to administrators and teachers knowing what to do during a school crisis, it is equally important for students to be trained in survival techniques. Parents should inquire about the training provided to staff and students, as well as any materials offered for additional practice at home.\n\nCollaboration between schools and local law enforcement agencies is also essential for comprehensive school safety plans. When school and law enforcement plans are not in sync, important procedures that could save lives may be overlooked.\n\nParents are encouraged to take the necessary measures to ensure their child's school is prepared and equipped to handle emergencies, such as shootings, in the safest and most effective manner possible.",
    " Title: Gallup Study Highlights Millennial Job Expectations and Engagement Levels\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study by polling firm Gallup suggests that the job expectations and engagement levels of millennials differ significantly from previous generations. The study, which surveyed workers from various generations, found that millennials are less engaged in their jobs, with 55 percent reporting they are \"checked out\" and lack passion and energy for their work. This is in contrast to 29 percent of millennials who report active engagement, the lowest figure among the four generations tracked in the survey.\n\nThe study attributes the job-hopping tendency among millennials to their emphasis on finding fulfilling work rather than just high-paying jobs. Millennials prioritize opportunities to learn and grow, quality of management, interest in the type of work, and opportunities for advancement over income when looking for a new job. Eighty-seven percent of millennials said personal development is an important characteristic in a job, and fewer millennials than other generations said they would pursue a different line of work for a raise.\n\nThe study also found that millennials have a higher turnover rate, with 21 percent changing jobs last year, and 60 percent saying they are currently open to a change in employment. This is three times more than non-millennials. The increased emphasis on jobs with meaning and the potential for personal development comes as the younger generation eschews conventional societal institutions, such as family and the church.\n\nThe Gallup survey found that just 27 percent of millennials are married, compared to 36 percent of Gen Xers, 48 percent of baby boomers, and 65 percent of traditionalists who were married at that stage in their lives. Additionally, the survey notes that just 55 percent of millennials report having interest in religion, compared to 65 percent of Gen Xers, 70 percent of baby boomers, and 75 percent of traditionalists.\n\nGreg Jao, vice president of campus engagement for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, suggests that the capricious employment habits of young people entering the workforce can be interpreted as a winding search for meaning. He believes that millennials are looking for people who help provide meaning and coherence to their experiences. Mr. Jao also points to the ascendance of activism on college campuses as a similar attempt by young people to belong to groups that transmit a sense of purpose greater than oneself.",
    " Title: Key Players in Government Shutdown Remain Divided on Budget and Immigration Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nThree days after a debate over federal spending and immigration policy led to a government shutdown, key battles between Democrats and Republicans remained unresolved on Tuesday. The compromise, which ended the shutdown and returned hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work after they were furloughed on Monday, comes at a time of profound political polarization in Washington, when trust across the aisle is in short supply.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump signed a short-term spending measure after Senate Democrats agreed on legislation to fund the government for three weeks, in exchange for a commitment to vote on ensuring protection for Dreamers, young undocumented migrants who were brought to the US as children.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated on Tuesday that he intended to allow debate on immigration legislation that would protect Dreamers. The offer was conditional on the government remaining open, a tactical move to ward off another shutdown in three weeks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer parried criticism on Tuesday, insisting that the Democratic leadership was \"pleased\" by the outcome of what was an audacious gambit to force Republicans' hand on immigration. He told reporters that Democrats were \"a lot better off today when it comes to the cause of Dreamers than we were four or five days ago.\"\n\nHowever, even if the Senate does act, there is no guarantee the House Republican leadership will follow. The deal was enough to win support from 33 Senate Democrats, who joined 48 Republicans to reopen the government on Monday night. Sixteen progressive Democrats voted against the measure, including Senator Kamala Harris of California, who said it would be \"foolhardy\" to trust McConnell.\n\nThe path to a bipartisan immigration solution that satisfies Democrats' desire for Dreamer protections, Republicans' requirement for increased border security, and Trump's demand for a wall seemed as distant as ever on Tuesday. An inchoate effort to restart negotiations was underway in the Senate without clear direction or leadership. Several senators on Tuesday said the current state of negotiations was unmoored from an earlier bipartisan effort that paired increased border security and tighter controls on immigration with a Dream Act, legislation that would offer a conditional path to citizenship for certain undocumented people.",
    " Title: California Schools Prepare for Potential Coronavirus Outbreaks, Review Emergency Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nEducation officials in California are reviewing and updating emergency plans in response to the potential spread of the new coronavirus. Federal officials have urged schools to start considering contingency plans for local outbreaks, as the virus has been detected in countries outside China, indicating that containment efforts have been breached and it is likely to spread in the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Solano County resident tested positive for the virus, marking the first case in the country from an unknown source. In response, the Fairfield-Suisin Unified School District, located in Solano County, has increased disinfection efforts, recommending daily cleaning of commonly shared surfaces to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nDr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stated that as the virus is likely to spread across communities, closing schools, holding classes in smaller groups, or remote education via the internet are all possibilities. She emphasized the need for individuals and families to start thinking about these scenarios now.\n\nIn a 2017 advisory regarding a flu pandemic, the Center for Disease Control suggested that closing schools before flu becomes widespread in schools and communities can help slow the spread of disease. Schools might also close if many staff and students are sick and regular school functions cannot be maintained.\n\nParents are encouraged to consider what to do if schools are closed or classes are held remotely in their community. Messonnier advised families to think about childcare arrangements if schools or daycares close. She also noted that many children in China are attending school remotely, but most schools in the Bay Area or across the country would not be able to conduct classes online due to a lack of computer or internet access for many students.\n\nSchool districts are required to have emergency plans for earthquakes, fires, active shooters, and other critical events. In recent years, pandemic flu plans for communicable diseases like the coronavirus have been added to these emergency plans. For example, the pandemic influenza plan in Tulare County includes county guidance to close a school if more than 30% of students are ill.\n\nState and county officials have been providing guidance to California school districts about how to deal with a potential outbreak. San Francisco schools spokeswoman Laura Dudnick stated that they are planning for how to manage in the case of an exposure at a school. The state Department of Education has already advised schools to bar travelers from mainland China from school grounds for 14 days.\n\nIn Contra Costa County, three people who have tested positive for coronavirus are currently being monitored in hospitals. However, there is no evidence that the virus is circulating in the county. Contra Costa County Office of Education spokesman Terry Koehne stated that they are working on a plan with health services to respond if any of their schools are at risk of becoming impacted.\n\nThe California Department of Education is monitoring the situation and working closely with agency partners to determine the best steps to be prepared. Any decisions to close schools as a result of the coronavirus would be made by individual county health agencies and school districts.",
    " Title: Potential Record-Breaking Gender Voting Gap in 2016 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming 2016 presidential election could witness a significant gender voting gap, potentially the largest in at least 60 years. Since 1996, women have consistently voted more heavily for Democratic candidates in presidential elections, with the most substantial gap occurring in 2000, when Al Gore received a 10-point advantage among women, while George W. Bush received an 11-point lead among men, resulting in a 21-point total gap.\n\nRecent national polls suggest that the gender gap in this year's election could be even wider. An average of three recent polls indicates that women favor Hillary Clinton by approximately 13 points, while men prefer Donald Trump by 12 points, totaling a 25-point gap.\n\nWhile it may seem logical that this kind of gender gap is occurring in the first election featuring a female major-party presidential candidate, it is not necessarily due to women flocking to Clinton. Instead, research indicates that party identification plays a more significant role in voting decisions. In fact, Clinton may not win women by as large a margin as her husband did in 1996.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the gender gap is not so much Clinton attracting women as Trump repelling them. Trump's overt sexism and comments about assaulting women have turned off even conservative white evangelical women, while his campaign's overtly masculine image may help explain his appeal to men.\n\nNeither gender is a monolithic voting bloc, with various fissures dividing either group (single women vote more Democratic than married women, for example, and white-collar white men are less Republican than blue-collar white men). However, 2016 could be unusual among white women, as they swung Democratic only once since the 1960s, in 1996. This year, polls suggest white women could swing Democratic for the first time in 20 years, though they currently lean slightly Republican.\n\nWhile whites make up nearly three-quarters of the electorate, their choices will help drive the broader gender gap depicted in the first chart. However, it appears less likely that the white gender gap will be as historic as the one seen nationwide, across all races.",

Moon's comments came following a message from Lee Hee-ho, the widow of late South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who suggested Moon himself should win the prize for his work with North Korea.\n\nMoon made the comments during a meeting with senior secretaries, according to a Korean official who briefed the media. \"President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Moon reportedly said. \"What we need is only peace.\"\n\nThe suggestion for Trump's Nobel Peace Prize nomination comes just days after Moon met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a summit at the Peace House in Panmunjom. Trump also continued to play an active role on Monday, floating the possibility of holding his expected summit with Kim at the same location.\n\nDuring the summit, the Korean leaders announced their commitment to achieving a \"nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\" and expressed hope to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War by the end of the year. However, it is not yet clear whether this will happen.\n\nThe leaders also agreed to suspend loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and dismantle broadcasting equipment along the heavily-armed border, as well as to stop flying propaganda leaflets across their border. Kim also promised Moon that he \"won't interrupt\" his \"early morning sleep anymore,\" referring to missile tests.\n\nDuring the summit, the Korean leaders agreed to jointly push for talks with the United States and potentially China to officially end the war. They also agreed to stop all hostile acts over \"land, sea, and air\" that cause military clashes and tensions.\n\nThe date for Trump's expected summit with Kim has not yet been scheduled. Last week, Trump criticized the Obama administration for allowing the situation in North Korea to escalate, while calling former Secretary of State John Kerry the \"worst negotiator\" he'd \"ever seen.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Moon applauded Trump, noting he \"deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks.\" Trump has imposed what his administration describes as \"the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country\" on North Korea, crippling the DPRK's economy. The Treasury Department aims to cut off sources of revenue and fuel used to boost the country's nuclear program and military.",

The letter, signed by a group of 11 Democratic senators, focuses on more than $1.2 million in compensation received by Whitaker from an organization that has sued Democratic lawmakers in the past, and Benczkowski's history working on behalf of a Russian bank.\n\nThe senators, including Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), expressed ethical concerns, particularly regarding special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nThe senators stated that previous DOJ responses to requests for information on these officials were heavily redacted. They noted that some of these requests were renewed because the DOJ had either failed to respond or provided incomplete responses to prior congressional requests. The senators urged the DOJ to provide prompt, complete, and public responses to the issues they raised to maintain public trust in an impartial DOJ.\n\nWhitaker assumed the top job at the Justice Department after President Donald Trump pushed out Attorney General Jeff Sessions in early November. Trump had been angry with Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation. Whitaker has not recused himself from the investigation, though he promised House Democrats that he would not tamper with its integrity.\n\nAs a private lawyer, Benczkowski represented Alfa Bank, whose owners have been identified by the Treasury Department as oligarchs with close ties to the Russian government, according to the letter. Senate Democrats criticized Benczkowski's nomination and confirmation, though he said at the time he would recuse himself from any investigations related to the bank.",

The SLPOA considers the displays as \"tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory.\"\n\nIn a statement, the SLPOA stated that five Rams players, including Jared Cook, Kenny Britt, Stedman Bailey, Chris Givens, and Tavon Austin from the team's receiving corps, as well as rookie running back Tre Mason, made the gesture during pregame introductions and after scoring a touchdown, respectively.\n\nThe Rams defeated the Oakland Raiders 52-0 at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis on Sunday. The team has denied any prior knowledge of the on-field demonstrations.\n\nLast week, a grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer involved in the shooting of Michael Brown, a teenager who was involved in a convenience-store robbery prior to his death. The decision led to riots, looting, and violence in Ferguson, Missouri. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force over the weekend.\n\nJeff Roorda, a representative of the SLPOA, noted, \"Our officers have been working 12-hour shifts for over a week. They had days off including Thanksgiving cancelled so that they could defend this community from those on the streets that perpetuate this myth that Michael Brown was executed by a brother police officer and then, as the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis's finest, they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer.

    " Title: Trump's Proposed Wall Along U.S.-Mexico Border Faces Skepticism from Border Residents\n\nArticle:\n\nBROWNSVILLE, Texas \u2014 The proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a key component of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign, has faced skepticism from residents in this southernmost U.S. city. The current fence, erected in 2009 through the 2006 Secure Fence Act, has been largely ineffective in stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs, according to residents, community leaders, and border patrol officials.\n\nBonnie Elbert, a politically conservative resident whose family has tended citrus farms in the area since the 1920s, questions the feasibility of a new wall. \"The one we have doesn't really work,\" Elbert said, driving through Loop Farms, more than 700 acres of orange and grapefruit orchards. \"What makes them think a new one will?\"\n\nThe current fence, which is nearly continuous along the border with Arizona, New Mexico, and California, due to long stretches of federal land, is chopped up into multiple sections in Texas due to the state's border with Mexico being mostly private property. Donald Trump has suggested building only about 1,000 miles of the proposed wall, citing natural barriers.\n\nHowever, the current fence has sparked costly legal fights with property owners, disrupted communities that straddle the border, and proven largely ineffective in preventing illegal crossings, according to residents, community leaders, and border patrol officials. Whoever pays for it, a newer, bigger wall would waste more money and be just as futile in preventing illegal crossings, Brownsville Mayor Tony Martinez said.\n\nBorder Patrol union has endorsed Trump due to his focus on border security and immigration reform. Chris Cabrera, a McAllen-based border patrol agent and vice president of the local chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the agents' union, noted that the concept of building a bigger wall without other measures, such as increased manpower and technology, is ill-informed.\n\nThe security fence project also ran into a litany of private property lawsuits and environmental opposition that ran up costs and led to delays, said Denise Gilman, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas-Austin School of Law, who has studied the fence's impact on the border. Most of the land along the Texas border is privately owned, making it much harder for the federal government to acquire and build on, she said.\n\nThe current wall snakes through the Rio Grande Valley just south of Highway 281, at times cutting right through residents' lawns, and through old town Brownsville, where some of the city's most historic buildings sit. The fence has broken up the continuity and goodwill between Brownsville and Matamoros, its sister city across the river in Mexico, and created an eyesore that rankles most locals. Across the river, Mexicans call it \"El Berlin,\" alluding to the 27-mile concrete wall that once divided East and West Berlin during the Cold War.",
    " Title: Historical Hostility Towards Hillary Clinton: A Look at the Roots of Public Disapproval\n\nArticle:\n\nA sense of untrustworthiness has long been associated with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but the origins of this hostility run deeper than the current election cycle. There exists a dedicated group of individuals who, despite not personally knowing Clinton, hold strong negative sentiments towards her. Whether these individuals constitute a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" as Clinton described in 1998 or simply represent a large conservative demographic, their existence and influence is undeniable.\n\nClinton's unfavorability rating may not match that of her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump, but she has attracted criticism from both the left and the right throughout the 2016 election. Polls have consistently cited the public's lack of trust in Clinton, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the \"Crooked Hillary\" epithet.\n\nThe 2016 election has seen attacks on Clinton related to her links to Wall Street, her missing emails, and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi consulate. However, the roots of hostility towards Clinton go much further back.\n\nCraig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, noted that when Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington D.C. as First Lady, she came with a reputation as a \"militant feminist, difficult to deal with.\" Shirley explained that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor, due to her keeping her maiden name.\n\nShirley attributed Clinton's perceived manner, persona, voice, and smirk as potential reasons for the hostility she faced. He suggested that people do not like to be talked down to, and Clinton has a habit of speaking condescendingly to people.\n\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clinton's administration, offered a different perspective. She argued that people's dislike of Hillary Clinton is not her own fault, but rather a product of societal expectations and media portrayals. Kamarck suggested that Clinton reminds people of their mothers or schoolteachers they did not like, and that there is an element of misogyny in this dislike.\n\nKamarck noted that it is rare for men who do not conform to conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted visibility when they are younger and meet traditional beauty standards. She added that the world is accustomed to viewing old men as strong and wise, while old women are not.\n\nIn conclusion, the hostility towards Hillary Clinton has a long and complex history, rooted in societal expectations, media portrayals, and personal interactions. While the specific reasons for this hostility may vary, the consistent theme is a lack of trust and likability towards Clinton, which has persisted throughout her political career.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Convened in Russia Election Meddling Investigation Signals Expansion of Mueller Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has requested a grand jury in Washington, D.C., to investigate Russia's interference in the 2016 election, signaling a significant expansion of the probe into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. This development indicates that the investigation has moved from investigating potential collusion to potentially charging individuals with crimes.\n\nThe call for a grand jury is typically made to enable prosecutors to subpoena documents, ensure witnesses testify under oath, and formally charge someone with a crime if they deem it necessary. The move to involve a grand jury suggests that there is still much more to investigate over the next few months.\n\nCNN reports that the special counsel has found the financial ties between Trump associates and Russia to be among the most fruitful areas of investigation. Since taking over the probe in May, Mueller has hired 16 lawyers with expertise in multiple areas including cybercrime, white-collar crime, and financial crime.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told the Wall Street Journal, \"This is yet a further sign that there is a long-term, large-scale series of prosecutions being contemplated and being pursued by the special counsel.\" Vladeck added, \"This suggests that the investigation is bigger and wider than Flynn, perhaps substantially so.\"\n\nThe growing inquiry poses another problem for President Trump: it becomes increasingly difficult for him to dismiss Mueller. As the investigation intensifies, it would appear unwise for Trump to ask Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to remove Mueller without \"good cause.\" If Trump were to attempt to relieve Mueller of his duties now, it could be perceived as a reaction to the growing probe, as there is yet no indication of Mueller's ineptitude in his role.\n\nRepublicans have warned Trump that firing Mueller could be detrimental to his presidency. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told NBC News, \"Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency, unless Mueller did something wrong.\"\n\nThe future course of action for Trump remains uncertain, but it is likely that he will not be pleased about more people scrutinizing his finances, associates, and family.",
    " Title: Economic Underperformance and Job Growth in the Lead-up to the 2012 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 Presidential Election approaches, the incumbent President Barack Obama is facing a challenging economic landscape. The economy is not meeting job growth expectations, with recent months showing underperformance compared to forecasts. This trend, which has been consistent since the first Friday of each month, has created a political stalemate.\n\nThe Labor Department releases a monthly jobs report on the first Friday of each month. These reports are often used by both parties to support their respective economic policies. In the June report, the U.S. economy created more than 80,000 jobs, a figure that President Obama described as a \"step in the right direction.\" However, Republican candidate Mitt Romney, on a break from his vacation, called the June numbers a \"kick in the gut.\"\n\nThe jobs reports, while politically charged, do not provide significant new insights about the economy. The data suggest that the economy is not in recession, but it is also not creating jobs at a rate that would significantly lower the unemployment rate, which has been above 8 percent for 41 consecutive months.\n\nEconomist Heidi Shierholz of the liberal Economic Policy Institute states, \"We are not in \u2014 nor are we slipping into \u2014 another recession, but neither are we getting the kind of job growth that will bring down the unemployment rate. In other words, the labor market is treading water.\"\n\nHistorically, high unemployment rates have been associated with incumbents losing their re-election bids. Since 1960, there have been four presidential elections featuring incumbents with unemployment rates above 7 percent: 1976, 1980, 1984, and 1992. Only in 1984 did the incumbent, Ronald Reagan, manage to secure another term.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider other factors that may have played significant roles in past elections. For instance, President Gerald Ford was hurt by his pardon of Richard Nixon in 1976, while President Jimmy Carter faced a primary challenge by Sen. Ted Kennedy in 1980. In 1992, H. Ross Perot's third-party bid pulled votes away from President George H.W. Bush, allowing Bill Clinton to win with just 43 percent of the popular vote.\n\nIn conclusion, the lackluster economic growth and job creation are significant factors propelling Mitt Romney's candidacy. Romney has made the economy's underwhelming performance, which he blames on Obama, the central argument for his case for a change in the White House. The slowdown of economies in Europe and China suggests the situation may worsen for the U.S. economy before it improves.\n\nPresident Obama, however, has shown a resilience and political acumen that has often left his opponents questioning their assumptions. Whether he will be able to defy political gravity and secure another term remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Obamacare's Third Year of Open Enrollment Faces Challenges with Rising Premiums, Cancellations, and Limited Options\n\nArticle:\n\nThe third year of Obamacare's open enrollment began on Sunday, with a revamped website featuring fresh photos and high-tech features. However, the actual insurance offerings under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law have faced challenges, with premiums rising, cancellations mounting, and choices decreasing.\n\nPremiums are increasing significantly in many states. In Alaska, premiums will be nearly 40 percent higher next year, while people buying insurance on the Minnesota exchange will pay anywhere from 14 to 49 percent more. Premiums are just one part of the high-cost story; many plans are also raising deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOne of the most significant changes from the 2010 promise of \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" is the new advice for people to \"shop around\" to avoid brutal rate increases. Switching insurance plans each year may result in slightly lower rate increases, but for some people, their old plan will not be available at any price.\n\nMore than half a million people insured by one of the health co-ops that have shut down in 11 states over the past few months will not have their plans available. In some states, plans are changing dramatically, even if the company remains. A patient may find that her longtime doctor will no longer be a part of her plan's network, or that the hospital nearest to her home is no longer included by her insurance.\n\nIn some states, the number of options is becoming increasingly limited. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, people living in 14 of Nevada's 16 counties will have only one or two companies to pick from. In Wyoming, with the failure of WINHealth, residents will have only one option.\n\nInsurance through Obamacare is largely coming down to a simple choice of \"take it or leave it.\" More and more Americans are leaving it. The only people who are consistently signing up are those who receive subsidies from Washington. According to the IRS, 90 percent of people who received government insurance subsidies last year got the wrong amount.\n\nTo avoid an all-out panic over low enrollment, the administration is trying to lower expectations. It has lowered the bar for success to around 10 million people enrolled for 2016, which is half of the 21 million people the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says should be covered next year. It is also essentially flat compared to the 9.9 million who were enrolled in June.\n\nSenator John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and a physician, has stated that Obamacare is failing because too many people want nothing to do with it. As the costs continue to rise, more people receive cancellation notices, and the exchanges offer fewer choices, the collapse will only continue. We may look back at this past Sunday as the beginning of the end.",
    " Title: Far-Left Groups Involved in Escalating Political Violence in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the violent clashes at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, media attention has focused on self-described \"anti-fascists\" (or \"antifa\") who were present at the rally. These far-left actors have been involved in escalating political violence in the United States, according to various reports and statements from the groups themselves.\n\nMany establishment political figures have compared these \"anti-fascists\" to American soldiers on D-Day, but their own statements indicate they are not similar in their objectives. Instead of protecting America's system of government, they aim to destroy it, according to their statements.\n\nSince the beginning of the Trump administration, far-left actors have declared their intention to use massive demonstrations to disrupt the American political process as much as possible. A common mantra among far-left groups, starting shortly before the inauguration, was to make America \"ungovernable.\"\n\nRefuse Fascism, a driving force behind the violent, politically motivated riots in Berkeley, was among the left-wing groups at Charlottesville. The group urged confrontation with the white nationalists and took credit for organizing the vandals who toppled a city-owned Confederate statue in Durham, North Carolina this week.\n\nAnother far-left group at Charlottesville was CrimethInc, an anarchist group that holds that anarchism is necessary to destroy white supremacy, which the group says cannot be fully extinguished in a democracy. The group advocates for the destruction of hierarchy, including white supremacy, patriarchy, policing, capitalism, and the state.\n\nThe Workers World Party, a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary group, was also present at Charlottesville. The group has declared its support for Kim Jong Un's murderous dictatorship in North Korea and has consistently published propaganda-like screeds supporting Venezuela's murderous regime. The group took credit for organizing the vandals who toppled the city-owned Confederate statue in Durham, North Carolina this week.\n\nThe Workers World Party's stated goals are classic Marxism, including igniting an international socialist revolution and using the war budget to improve the lives of the working class and oppressed peoples. The group is opposed to all in the \"ruling establishment\" who hide \"behind a veil of 'democracy' and 'human rights.'\"\n\nWhile Workers World is currently fighting (literally) with white nationalists, the group is opposed to all in the \"ruling establishment\" who the group explains hide \"behind a veil of 'democracy' and 'human rights.'\" The group's post after Charlottesville concluded, \"Long live the independent struggle of this new progressive movement against the fascists, the cops and the capitalist establishment!\"",
    " Title: Sen. Dianne Feinstein Urges Hillary Clinton to Address Email Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has called for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to address the ongoing controversy surrounding her use of a personal email account for government business. Feinstein expressed her desire for Clinton to \"step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is.\"\n\nClinton, who is currently the frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, has been under scrutiny for conducting all of her official communications through a private email server set up in her Chappaqua, New York home. This has led to criticism over the potential security risks of transmitting sensitive information and speculation about the selective release of emails for official records.\n\nClinton has so far remained silent on the issue, with her only public statement being a late-night tweet on March 4, in which she called for the Justice Department to release her emails \"as soon as possible.\" However, Clinton did not address the issue during a Saturday night event in Coral Gables, Florida, for the Clinton Global Initiative University.\n\nIn contrast, one of Clinton's predecessors, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, stated that he has not retained any emails sent from his personal email account during his tenure at the department in the first George W. Bush administration. \"I do not have any to turn over,\" he said on Sunday. \"I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off.\"\n\nPowell added that most of the emails from his account were unclassified and \"pretty benign,\" and he was not concerned if they were recovered. He also noted that many of the emails from his account were addressed to State Department employees and the State.gov domain, but he was unsure if the State Department servers captured those emails or not.",
    " Title: UN Official Urges International Intervention as Islamic State Threatens Syrian Kurdish City of Kobani\n\nArticle:\n\nA UN official has issued a warning of impending \"humanitarian tragedies\" and has pleaded for global intervention on behalf of Kurds trapped in the Syrian city of Kobani, near the Turkish border, as Islamic State (IS) fighters are on the brink of taking control.\n\nKurds from villages across northern Syria have fled to Kobani for a final stand as IS has swept across vast territories, leaving a trail of death and destruction. The city has been under siege for three weeks, with IS fighters raising their flag over neighborhoods. UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, stated that the city is on the verge of falling.\n\nDe Mistura said, \"The world has seen with its own eyes the images of what happens when a city in Syria or in Iraq is overtaken by the terrorist group called ISIS or Da'esh: massacres, humanitarian tragedies, rapes, horrific violence.\" He added, \"The international community cannot sustain another city falling under ISIS.\"\n\nWith fighting taking place near the Turkish border, international pressure has increased on Ankara to take military action. Turkey has already taken in an estimated 200,000 refugees, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated that the coalition air campaign launched last month would not be enough to halt IS's advance.\n\nErdogan, whose troops are massed near the border but have not yet taken an offensive posture, called for greater cooperation with the Syrian opposition, which is fighting both extremists and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nThe capture of Kobani would give IS control of a large swath of land bordering Turkey and eliminate a vital pocket of Kurdish resistance. It would also provide a link between the group's territory near the ancient Syrian city of Aleppo and its largest operations base at Raqqa in northeastern Syria.\n\nWarplanes believed to be part of the U.S.-led coalition against IS struck militant positions on Tuesday, according to reports. Fighting continued into Tuesday morning on the outskirts of the town, with the Kurds reporting that their defenses benefited from the new round of airstrikes but were still outmatched by the more heavily armed militants.\n\nAs of Tuesday, ISIS fighters were reported to have entered the eastern outskirts of the city after capturing more than 300 surrounding Syrian Kurdish villages in the previous three weeks. ISIS raised their black flag in two separate places, one on top of a civilian apartment building and another on a hilltop near a checkpoint at the city's eastern entrance.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the Kurds forced the jihadists to withdraw from the eastern part of the town in heavy clashes after midnight Tuesday, adding that five loud explosions were heard in the town as warplanes soared overhead. However, a local Kurdish militia commander estimated to The Wall Street Journal that ISIS fighters were still a mile from the city center.\n\nBefore the recent fighting began, the city had been a focal point for refugees fleeing Syria's three-year-long civil war. Between 160,000 and 180,000 people are believed to have fled into Turkey since the IS advance began. A Kurdish politician told Reuters that more than 2,000 Syrian Kurds, including women and children, had been evacuated from the town in the midst of the fighting on Monday.\n\nState Department officials will travel to Turkey later this week to discuss the status of the international coalition, with Retired Marine Gen. John Allen, the White House's special envoy in the fight against ISIS, among those traveling to Turkey.\n\nDespite U.S. pressure to become a full-fledged member of the coalition, and despite the Turkish parliament passing a law giving the government authority to conduct operations against ISIS in Syria or Iraq, Ankara has largely stayed on the sidelines. Fox News reported on Monday that twenty Turkish tanks have been stationed on a hillside overlooking Kobani, ready to strike the city on short notice. However, Turkish authorities have mostly been preoccupied with attempting to control the flow of Kurdish refugees across the border and deal with their protests at the government's inaction.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Turkish media reported that police in Istanbul and at least six other Turkish cities clashed with hundreds of demonstrators. The private Dogan news agency reported clashes breaking out in several Istanbul neighborhoods overnight, as protesters set up barricades, hurled stones, fireworks, and firebombs at police, and set a bus on fire. One police officer was injured. Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse similar protests in the mostly Kurdish-populated cities of Diyarbakir, Batman, Van, Sirnak, Sanliurfa, and Hakkari.",
    " Title: Venezuelan Opposition Rally Fails to Oust President Maduro, Tensions Escalate with Global Powers\n\nArticle:\n\nVenezuelans heeded the call of opposition leader Juan Guaido on Wednesday, taking to the streets in a bid to force President Nicolas Maduro from power. However, the demonstrations, which Guaido described as the \"largest march\" in Venezuela's history, appeared to have little concrete impact, with many protesters returning home by late afternoon.\n\nGuaido, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. The standoff has increased tensions between the United States and Russia, with each accusing the other of interference in Venezuela's affairs.\n\nIn Caracas, National Guards fired tear gas at a hardcore group of demonstrators who remained, and one injured demonstrator was carried by others to a first aid truck, according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 video. A young woman died in surgery after being shot during a protest in Caracas, and Guaido confirmed via Twitter that a woman died after being shot.\n\nDespite Guaido's calls for the military to support him, the armed forces leadership has remained loyal to Maduro, who has been in power since the death of his mentor, former President Hugo Chavez, in 2013. Guaido told thousands of supporters that the regime's response to the protests showed they were \"not even imagining the maximum pressure.\"\n\nIt remains unclear what more Guaido can do at this point. The Venezuelan opposition has staged large street protests against Maduro in the past, but they have failed to dislodge him despite a deep economic recession and hyperinflation.\n\nDemonstrators said they were prepared for the process of ousting Maduro to last a long time. \"We need to keep going,\" said Laila Amezquita, a 52-year-old nurse from Caracas' downtown Candelaria district. \"In three months, Guaido's been able to do what they have not done in 20 years, and one has to be patient.\"\n\nOthers are frustrated that nothing has changed more than three months after Guaido invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency. Guaido is recognized as Venezuela's legitimate head of state by the United States, the European Union, and others, while Maduro is backed by countries including Russia, China, and Cuba.\n\nThose fault lines are increasingly putting Venezuela at the heart of global geopolitical tensions. The United States has imposed sanctions on the Maduro government and refused to rule out military intervention, although it says it prefers a peaceful transition.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday that further \"aggressive steps\" in Venezuela would have grave consequences, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry. The Pentagon has acknowledged detailed contingency planning for a potential intervention in Venezuela but has downplayed any active preparations.\n\nThe United States has accused Russia of interfering in Venezuela, an ally of Russia since the time of Chavez. Pompeo said Maduro had been expected to flee the country on Tuesday but Russia convinced him to stay, which the Kremlin has denied.\n\nVenezuelan living standards have declined even further in the first several months of the year, with blackouts and water shortages adding to hyperinflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine that have prompted millions to emigrate. Triple the usual daily number of Venezuelans fled across the border to Brazil on Tuesday, according to Brazilian government data.\n\nMaduro, who says Guaido is a puppet of the United States seeking to orchestrate a coup, also called a march on Wednesday. In a speech to supporters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace, Maduro said he recognized the need for \"big changes within the Bolivarian revolution.\" He did not give details.",
    " Title: Ebola Outbreak in Guinea Rises, Aid Workers Intensify Efforts to Contain Spread\n\nArticle:\n\nAid workers are intensifying their efforts in Guinea to combat a resurgence of the Ebola virus, which has been largely contained in neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. The increased activity is due to concerns that the upcoming rainy season could hinder travel to remote villages where new cases of the disease are emerging.\n\nJordan Tappero, director of the division of global health protection for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), expressed optimism that Guinea could follow the same trajectory as Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the disease has declined. He stated that the number of personnel in the field in Guinea has tripled, and many other organizations have taken similar actions.\n\nSince the Ebola outbreak began in the jungles of Guinea in December 2013, nearly 25,000 people across West Africa have been infected, with more than 10,000 deaths. The latest weekly total of new cases in Guinea, reported on March 15, was the highest for the nation this year, with 95 cases. However, this week, only 45 new cases were reported, a decrease that is still concerning to World Health Organization (WHO) workers due to the emergence of new infections in unexpected areas.\n\nMany of the outbreaks are in distant villages, and only 38% of new infections in Guinea last week were among people being tracked. This is a low rate that is troubling because it indicates that healthcare workers are not effectively establishing a chain of infection, a crucial element in defeating the virus. The process of contact tracing, or tracking all who have been exposed, is essential to breaking the chain of infection and halting the disease.\n\nTracing contacts in new infections will become increasingly difficult during the rainy season, which begins in June and is expected to see daily downpours by July. \"That's why we have to get down to as close to zero with contact tracing all known, laboratory-confirmed cases by then,\" Tappero said. \"I'll be honest with you, people are fatigued.\"\n\nIn nearby Sierra Leone, where more than 3,700 have died and almost 12,000 were infected, the nation's 6 million residents have been ordered to stay home for three days beginning Friday, except for religious services, in an effort to fight the spread of the disease, according to Associated Press.\n\nEarlier this month, an American health worker ill with Ebola was evacuated from Sierra Leone to the United States and remains in critical condition at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The worker was among 12 new Ebola infections involving caregivers in Sierra Leone and Guinea in the past few weeks. Nearly 500 healthcare workers across West Africa have died of the disease since the outbreak began. In Guinea, the workers affected are often a remote village's only nurse or doctor.\n\n\"We really need the rate of healthcare infections to be zero,\" said Ian Norton, a physician with the World Health Organization.\n\nNew infections in Sierra Leone are slowly diminishing, WHO reported. Last week, 84% of the 33 new cases were among people health officials were tracking\u2014good news, WHO said, because it shows health workers are successfully identifying and isolating those who might become infected.\n\nIn Liberia, infections fell dramatically, dropping to zero for three straight weeks this month. Beaches and schools re-opened. Students showed up to have their temperatures taken and wash hands before entering class.\n\nMore than 4,200 of those killed by the virus were in Liberia, where President Obama deployed about 3,000 troops to build clinics and train health care workers late last year. About 300 troops remain there.\n\nThere has been at least one setback. A ban on sporting activities was lifted, and the first soccer match was underway in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, on March 20, with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in attendance when word of a new Ebola case broke. A 44-year-old mother of six who worked as a food server at a school fell ill. She rode on a motorbike-taxi to the hospital, a common means of transportation in Monrovia. One small school where she worked has been temporarily closed. Eighty-six people who were in contact with her have been quarantined. The woman died on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is investigating whether the disease might have been transmitted through sexual contact with an Ebola survivor. Although the man she was dating was released from care more than three months before, research has found that the virus can survive in male sexual organs for an extended period of time.\n\n\"We were getting close to the finishing line when this sad event occurred,\" said Liberian government spokesman Isaac Jackson. \"We are all saddened by this development. But we are consoled because we have in place the best system, surveillance, contact tracers, so we are still committed to beating this virus.\"",
    " Title: Federal Election Commission Receives Complaint Against Rep. Ilhan Omar for Alleged Misuse of Campaign Funds\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Election Commission (FEC) has received a complaint against Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for alleged misuse of campaign funds. The complaint, filed by the National Legal and Policy Center, alleges that Omar and her campaign violated the prohibition on the personal use of campaign funds by reimbursing political consultant Tim Mynett for his travel in 2019.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Mynett's formal relationship with Rep. Omar's campaign began in July 2018, with the payment of $7,000 directly to Mynett. However, the reimbursements for Mynett's travel did not commence until April 2019, the same month that Dr. Mynett alleges in her divorce filing that her husband told her of the affair and made a \"shocking declaration of love\" for Rep. Omar.\n\nThe complaint states that Mynett's \"more recent travel and long work hours now appear to be more related to his affair with Rep. Omar than his actual work commitments.\" The National Legal and Policy Center's statement also notes that the timing of the payments to Mynett's firm, E Street Group, coincides with the period after Omar won the contested primary and during the noncompetitive general election in her D+26 district.\n\nOmar has not commented on the issue of campaign funds being improperly used, stating, \"I have no interest in allowing the conversation about my personal life to continue and so I have no desire to discuss it.\" In June, Omar was ordered to pay back thousands of dollars to her campaign after breaking campaign finance laws.\n\nThe details of the divorce filing by Dr. Beth Jordan Mynett, alleging her husband's affair with Rep. Omar, were reported by the New York Post on Tuesday. The Washington Examiner reported that the overwhelming majority of Omar's funds spent on the E Street Group were paid after she won the contested primary and during the general election, contrary to FEC rules, as Omar's filings did not designate whether her E Street Group disbursements (or any of her disbursements) were for the primary election or the general election.",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Prioritize Political Bases Over Policy Initiatives in 2014\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2014, both President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner prioritized maintaining the support of their respective political bases over advancing critical policy initiatives.\n\nFor the Republican speaker, a commitment to significant immigration changes, including a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers, was abandoned due to a perceived conservative backlash. The argument from the right was that turning out conservatives was crucial for the 2014 midterm success, and substantial immigration changes would antagonize the base.\n\nPresident Obama countered by dropping a proposal from his new budget that he had considered essential just a year ago: a more modest calculation of inflation adjustments for Social Security. Previously, this was a key component of entitlement reform and deficit reduction. However, liberals opposed the idea, and pushing it in 2014 could have angered a base that the Democrats needed in November.\n\nWhen Boehner retreated on immigration, it was the White House and its allies who criticized him for being short-sighted and prioritizing politics over the national interest. Conversely, from Boehner's office, the argument was that the President has no interest in addressing the looming debt crisis and is already conceding defeat with three years left in his term.\n\nThe speaker's decision on immigration and Obama's on Social Security can be seen as tactical moves, with both leaders hoping to position themselves politically more favorably in the future. The midterm elections are expected to result in the Republicans maintaining their House majority, with the battle for control of the Senate being the significant 2014 struggle. The President has made it clear that protecting the fragile Democratic majority in the Senate is his top priority.\n\nOrganizations focused on deficit reduction and structural budget reforms praised Obama when he embraced the Social Security shift last year, estimating it to save $233 billion over a decade. However, these same centrist organizations criticized his decision to abandon the Social Security change this year as a clear political shift to the left.\n\nThe \"chained CPI\" shift for Social Security is likely to re-emerge as a debating point next year, but Obama could face even more contentious issues anathema to liberals if the GOP manages to take control of the Senate.\n\nWith the stakes high, it is clear that leadership in both parties is moving away from an environment of major policy compromise and toward full-scale election positioning. To that end, Obama attended a 2014 Organizing for Action summit on Tuesday, with the goal of trying to defy the midterm historical odds and protect Democratic seats.",
    " Title: Michael Bloomberg's Potential Entry into the 2020 Democratic Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, known for his ambition and pragmatic approach to politics, is reportedly considering a late entry into the 2020 Democratic primary race. This move comes amid perceived struggles by former Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently the best-known candidate in the contest but has been facing challenges in polls in early primary states.\n\nBiden's poll numbers have been falling behind Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and are in danger of dropping behind Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg as well. This situation is problematic for Biden, as it raises questions about his ability to attract new support in the remaining months before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nCompounding Biden's financial challenges is his cash deficit compared to Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg. The trio ended September with over $20 million in the bank, while Biden had less than $9 million. This financial disparity means Biden will likely be unable to compete with his rivals in terms of television advertising and organizational resources once the race moves beyond the first four states.\n\nWith Biden showing signs of flagging, the obvious candidate who could benefit is Buttigieg, who has positioned himself in the same pragmatic lane as the former Vice President. There are indications that Buttigieg is gaining ground, particularly in Iowa. However, there are doubts about whether the Democratic Party's establishment wing is ready to back a 37-year-old whose most significant experience to date has been as mayor of his hometown.\n\nEnter Michael Bloomberg, an establishment favorite with a long record of centrist policy-making and significant wealth. Bloomberg's reported preparations to enter the race are likely rooted in Biden's perceived struggles, as well as concerns about a rising Warren and the potential impact she could have on the Democratic Party's chances in the general election.\n\nIt is important to note that Biden and Bloomberg are not interchangeable candidates. While Biden has a demonstrated constituency among working-class and minority voters, it is unclear what Bloomberg's \"natural\" constituency is beyond those who watch \"Morning Joe\" and ride Amtrak's Acela between New York and Washington, D.C.\n\nBloomberg's candidacy is a response to the perceived weakness of Biden's campaign and the fear of a rising Warren and her potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the general election. The question for Bloomberg is whether he has enough time to turn this opportunity into a viable campaign.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Budget Agreement in Sight as Government Shutdown Threat Recedes\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A bipartisan budget agreement appears to be within reach, as lawmakers work to avoid a repeat of last month's government shutdown. President Donald Trump, however, has hinted at the possibility of another shutdown if he cannot secure his desired immigration policies.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump stated, \"I'd love to see a shutdown if we can't get this stuff taken care of,\" repeating the sentiment for emphasis. This statement was strikingly disconnected from the progress on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are close to finalizing a short-term spending measure and a broader, long-term budget agreement.\n\nThe broader agreement, if approved, would provide significant spending increases for both the Pentagon and domestic federal programs, as well as approve overdue disaster relief money and potentially crucial legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit and avoid a possible default.\n\nDemocratic leaders have abandoned their strategy of using the funding fight to secure concessions on immigration, specifically on extending protections for \"Dreamer\" immigrants who have lived in the U.S. illegally since they were children. Instead, Democrats are preparing to cut a deal that would allocate funds for other priorities, such as combatting opioids, while taking their chances on resolving the immigration impasse later.\n\nThe House passed a six-week stopgap spending bill on Tuesday night, with a 245-182 vote, mostly along party lines. The bill contains increases for the military that have long been demanded by Trump and his Republican allies. However, the measure is increasingly likely to be rewritten by the Senate to include legislation implementing the broader budget agreement.\n\nHouse Democrats canceled a scheduled three-day retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore to develop a strategy for the midterm elections, citing the pressing issues Congress will likely vote on over the next three days.\n\nThe budget negotiations, led by the Senate's top leaders, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer of New York, have intensified in recent days. The looming government shutdown at midnight Thursday has added urgency to the talks. In addition to the military and domestic spending, the deal taking shape would approve overdue disaster relief money and potentially crucial legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit and avoid possible default.\n\n\"I think we're on the way to getting an agreement and getting it very soon,\" said McConnell.\n\nProspects for addressing immigration, however, remain unclear. The Senate is scheduled to begin a debate next week to address the dilemma of immigrants left vulnerable by the looming expiration of former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nWeeks of bargaining have left the two parties divided over how to extend protections for such Dreamer immigrants and a court ruling has blurred the March 5 deadline. McConnell stated Tuesday that while he hopes \"we will end up having something,\" he was unsure if any proposed measure would garner the 60 votes needed for approval.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly fueled the immigration dispute as he defended Trump's proposed solution. The retired general noted that the White House proposal would expand protection for some 1.8 million immigrants. This group includes both the 690,000 currently shielded and also \"the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses, but they didn't sign up,\" he said.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois, his party's chief immigration negotiator, bristled at the comment. \"I'm sorry for that characterization. It doesn't surprise me from Gen. Kelly,\" he said.\n\nGOP defense hawks are prevailing over the party's depleted ranks of deficit hawks, championing major new spending on military programs. Democrats, meanwhile, are leveraging their influence to increase spending for domestic priorities such as combating opioid misuse.\n\nThe result could be the return of trillion-dollar deficits for the first time since Obama's first term. The stopgap spending bill would keep the government open through March 23 to allow time to write and pass detailed follow-up \"omnibus\" legislation to fund the government through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe prospective longer-term budget agreement would provide relief from a budget freeze that lawmakers say threatens military readiness and training as well as domestic priorities such as combating opioid abuse and repairing the government's troubled health care system for veterans.\n\nThe temporary funding measure would also reauthorize funding for community health centers, which enjoy widespread bipartisan support. Aides in both parties said the budget measure may also contain a provision to raise the government's $20.5 trillion borrowing limit. Legislation to increase the debt ceiling is always a headache, especially for House GOP leaders whose rank and file have in the past used the votes to register an objection to deficit spending.\n\nAnother likely addition is more than $80 billion in long-overdue hurricane relief for Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, a top priority of lawmakers in both parties.\n\nUnder Congress's arcane ways, a broad-brush agreement to increase legally binding spending \"caps\"\u2014which would otherwise keep the budgets for the military and domestic agencies essentially frozen\u2014would be approved, then followed by a far more detailed catchall spending bill that would take weeks to negotiate.\n\nIt's clear that Senate Democrats have no appetite for another government shutdown. Their unity splintered during last month's three-day closure. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had linked progress on the budget with action to address the immigration program, but other Democrats are beginning to agitate for delinking the two, lest the opportunity for a budget pact is lost. And having tried and failed to link progress on the budget to DACA during last month's government shutdown battle, many Democrats aren't spoiling for a repeat.\n\n\"It's hard. If we can get a good deal that funds disaster relief, funds domestic priorities, funds the opioid crisis, it would be a difficult call,\" said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash. \"DACA's important and it ought to get done. But what's the path?\"\n\nSchumer said he and Pelosi are \"working from the same page,\" appearing to discount speculation that she might oppose the coming pact.",
    " Title: Military Leaders Express Concern Over Trump's Sudden Decision to Ban Transgender Personnel\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it. Trump's declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military.\n\nRights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands.\n\nThe United States' top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump's announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders, and senior enlisted leaders.\n\n\"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President,\" Dunford wrote. \"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance,\" Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters.\n\nDunford neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump's decision. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force acknowledged that Trump's announcement on Wednesday was \"unexpected.\"\n\nThe Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis approved a six-month delay to allow for a review on June 30.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people. His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans.\n\nTrump cited \"tremendous medical costs and disruption\" as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual's capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference.\n\nThe Army's chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army. \"I will be candid... This is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean-cut either way,\" he said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump's decision was still being worked out. Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took.\n\nTrump's plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue. Trump's tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.\n\nIf the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say. \"There's no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military,\" said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal.\n\nIt was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists. Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status. \"I try to be tough about it,\" he said, but added: \"It breaks your spirit down.\"\n\nOne active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted. \"We're scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from,\" the officer said by phone. \"Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today's military. Our service personnel today don't give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts.\"",
    " Title: Legalization of Marijuana and its Impact on the Media Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Times' recent editorial advocating for the legalization of marijuana has sparked discussions about the potential economic and societal implications of such a move. One of the significant effects could be a resurgence in the media industry, as marijuana, like cigarettes and alcohol, could become a lucrative advertising market.\n\nThe legalization of marijuana would, at least on some level, legalize its marketing. Cigarette advertising was curbed only after the health effects of smoking became known. The legalization of marijuana acknowledges its benefits, or at least its pleasures, significantly outweighing its negative effects.\n\nThe New York Times' editorial suggests that the marijuana industry could transform the media business. This transformation might be facilitated by the nascent marijuana industry's argument for the right to advertise, an argument that, if it prevails, could lead to a growth in media revenue.\n\nOne potential solution to address concerns about the impact of marijuana advertising on children could be to restrict advertising to print media, appealing to adults. This approach might protect the young while also potentially revitalizing the print media industry, which currently suffers from a lack of advertising interest and an aging readership.\n\nThe legalization of marijuana could also lead to a growth industry in media focused on pot culture and behavior. Companies like Vice Media, which specializes in reaching young, inattentive audiences, have already been successful in this market. The open expression of pot culture and behavior in traditional media could reestablish the connection between mainstream media and the young.\n\nIn the past, media had a strong connection to their audience when they embraced and acted out drunkenness. Pot, or pot style, could become part of what is now called content marketing, creating a symbiotic marketing environment that could attract a range of products willing to pay a premium to reach this group of people.\n\nContemporary media faces challenges due to the enormous number of outlets competing for the attention of American consumers and the lack of a common experience that reliably brings everyone together. Pot, as a unifying cultural principle, could change that.\n\nMichael Wolff, a two-time National Magazine Award winner and author of best-selling books, including \"The Man Who Owns the News,\" writes about the modern media business.",
    " Title: American Teenagers and Their Parents Accused of Attempting to Join ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nThree American teenagers, all of whom are of Sudanese or Somali descent, were intercepted by German authorities at Frankfurt airport and returned to the United States after attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The girls, aged 15, 16, and 17, were questioned and released.\n\nThe girls' parents claim they had no knowledge of their children's plans to travel. None of the girls had a history of running away before. The incident, along with similar cases in Canada and Australia, has raised concerns about the attraction of ISIS to young Western recruits.\n\nThe first indication of trouble came when one of the girls' schools in the Denver area contacted her father, Assad Ibrahim, to inform him that she had not attended class. Ibrahim's daughter initially told him that she was late for class, but officials later filed a runaway report.\n\nThe girl also kept quiet about her two friends, Americans of Somali descent, who were reportedly flying with her to Turkey via Germany. The friends' father, Ali Farah, said they had told him they were going to the library. When Farah returned home from work, a visitor arrived, allegedly Ibrahim, who advised him to check if his daughters' passports were missing, which they were, along with $2,000 in cash.\n\nThe FBI was subsequently contacted, and the girls were intercepted at Frankfurt airport. The investigation into the girls' travel is unlikely to lead to charges, especially since they are minors, according to two U.S. officials.\n\nInvestigators are also unsure if the girls had a specific goal for their travel. The online activity of the girls and their friends did not set off any tripwires typically used by the FBI to flag potential jihadist sympathizers.\n\nThe incident in Denver is not an isolated case. In Canada, a 25-year-old radical convert to Islam, Martin Rouleau Couture, ran down two soldiers with his car, killing one, and led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, southeast of Montreal. Couture had previously tried to join foreign jihad but was arrested on his way to Turkey.\n\nIn addition, a 17-year-old Australian boy appeared in a video with ISIS fighters, threatening to behead Western leaders, including President Obama, and fly the ISIS flag over the White House.\n\nExperts suggest that ISIS's appeal to young Western recruits is not just a radical interpretation of Islam but a search for identity, purpose, and belonging. The slick videos and social media used by ISIS to attract potential recruits have also been a concern for terrorism experts in the United States.\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating the online activity of the three girls to see if anyone was helping them. The investigation into their travel is unlikely to lead to charges, especially since they are minors. The case serves as a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by homegrown violent extremists and the need for continued vigilance.",
    " Title: President Obama's Approval Rating Drops to Record Low in New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's approval rating has reached a new low of 37 percent in a recent poll by CBS News, marking the lowest approval rating of his presidency. Simultaneously, his disapproval rating has reached a high of 57 percent.\n\nSince October, Obama's approval rating has dropped by 9 points, according to the CBS News poll. Approval of his healthcare overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare, is at an all-time low of 31 percent, with disapproval at 61 percent. The administration is currently dealing with the fallout from a rocky rollout of major parts of the law on October 1. Forty-six percent of respondents said they \"disapprove strongly\" of the law.\n\nEighty-eight percent of Republicans disapprove of the law, with little change from last month's 87 percent figure. Approval among independents fell from 38 percent to 27 percent, and approval of Democrats dropped from 74 percent to 58 percent.\n\nTwo-thirds of respondents said the signup for insurance on government health care exchanges is not going well, and nearly two-thirds are not confident that the federal HealthCare.gov website will be mostly fixed by December 1. White House press secretary Jay Carney stated that a goal of 80 percent recruitment among all users of the website would be nearly the best result possible. Carney explained that the 20 percent who can't enroll includes people who aren't \"comfortable\" signing up online or have personal circumstances that are too \"complex\" to use the website.\n\nA majority of Americans do not favor outright repeal of the law. Seven percent think it's working well and should be kept as is, 48 percent think some changes are needed, and 43 percent think it should be repealed.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign last fall, 60 percent of voters thought of Mr. Obama as honest and trustworthy, compared to 49 percent of Americans in the poll released Wednesday.\n\nAmericans hold dim views of both parties in Congress; just 26 percent approve of how congressional Democrats are doing their job, and 21 percent say the same for congressional Republicans. The mark for Democrats is down slightly from last month's 31 percent, and Republicans ticked up from 18 percent. Disapproval of Democrats increased from 65 percent to 68 percent, and disapproval of Republicans declined from 78 percent to 73 percent.\n\nThe CBS News poll of 1,010 adults was conducted from November 15-18 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.",
    " Title: Republican Response to Bergdahl's Release: A Political Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe release of U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive by the Taliban since 2009, has sparked a political debate among Republican legislators. Critics are questioning the decision to exchange five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl's freedom, with some suggesting it could serve as a pretext for impeachment hearings against President Barack Obama.\n\nThe controversy stems from the fact that, had a Republican president negotiated the release, the same critics would likely have defended the move. The focus on the negotiation with terrorists, rather than the return of a U.S. prisoner of war, is the crux of the criticism.\n\nSome Republicans argue that the deal sends a message to terrorist groups worldwide that there is value in taking American hostages. However, this assertion has been challenged, as guerrilla forces have been taking hostages since the inception of warfare, and prisoner trades have occurred in Afghanistan in the past.\n\nThe long-form profile of Bergdahl written by journalist Mike Hastings in 2012 for Rolling Stone suggests that the GOP may use Bergdahl's personal history and actions as ammunition against him. The profile portrays Bergdahl as a disillusioned soldier who expressed disdain for the military and the U.S. actions in Afghanistan.\n\nThe debate over Bergdahl's release and the five Taliban prisoners exchanged for him is likely to continue, potentially escalating into a political soap opera that could last until President Obama's term ends in 2017. The question remains whether Republicans can make this issue resonate beyond their base, as public sentiment seems to favor the return of an American life, regardless of the cost.",
    " Title: Job Market Boom Contrasted with Proposed Guaranteed Jobs Program\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, 26-year-old software developer David Casarez, who was homeless and jobless, received over 200 job offers after he stood at an intersection in Mountain View, California, with a homemade cardboard sign and a resume. This incident highlights the current robust job market, with more job openings than job seekers.\n\nThe unemployment rate is near a half-century low, and unemployment among blacks and Hispanics is at a nearly all-time low. However, some Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), are campaigning for a \"guaranteed jobs\" program, despite the ongoing economic boom.\n\nThe proposed program would guarantee a job and a paycheck for anyone not working, funded by taxpayers. House Democrats introduced guaranteed job legislation last week. Critics argue that these Democrats aim to undo the Trump tax cuts, which they claim are responsible for the economic boom, to fund these make-work jobs and other programs.\n\nThe hiring surge is attributed to a significant increase in business investment, up 9.4% during the first half of 2018. Investors are pouring money into private sector companies to buy more vehicles and equipment and increase commercial construction. This increased investment leads to more job opportunities in the private sector.\n\nThe tax cuts, particularly the drastic reduction in the corporate tax rate, have encouraged investors to invest more, as they can earn a higher after-tax return on their money. This, in turn, leads to increased hiring.\n\nHowever, despite the current job market's strength, there are still people who are unemployed, lack skills, and have stopped looking for work. A public jobs program is not the solution to boost the nation's low labor participation rate, as the U.S. already has 41 federal jobs programs costing a total of $17 billion annually with little success in getting people into lasting private sector jobs.\n\nMake-work programs, like the ones proposed by Booker, Gillibrand, and other Democrats, have a poor track record of getting people into lasting private sector jobs, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research survey by David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, and co-authors.\n\nThe Democrats pushing for a federal job guarantee are not primarily concerned with ensuring people work, as they vehemently oppose work or work-readiness requirements for Medicaid and other public benefits. Instead, their job guarantee campaign is seen as a thinly disguised effort at radical income redistribution.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has also expressed support for a universal government-guaranteed income, with the goal of closing the \"yawning disparities\" between rich and poor. This would mean everyone receiving a check from the government, regardless of whether they work or not. In Chicago, the Democratic-controlled municipal legislature is backing a plan to give 1,000 families a $500 monthly stipend, no questions asked, with no work required.\n\nFor determined individuals like David Casarez, it is crucial to be aware of the potential consequences of the Democrats' tax hikes and redistributionist schemes, which could stifle the jobs boom and make private sector workers' paychecks fair game for supporting those who choose not to work.",
    " Title: Democrats and Republicans Negotiate Fiscal Cliff Deal, Focus on Tax Increases and Revenue Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for the \"fiscal cliff\" approaches, top Democrats have increased pressure on their Republican counterparts to accept tax increases on the wealthy as part of a broader agreement. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, stated that she would not accept a deal without such provisions. Republicans continue to reject outright tax increases but remain open to modifying the tax code and possibly eliminating some deductions, particularly those that benefit the rich.\n\nPresident Obama has softened his rhetoric in recent days, emphasizing revenue generation from the wealthy income group through closing loopholes or other means, rather than raising tax rates. Finding a compromise that allows both parties to claim they are fulfilling their respective promises is crucial for reaching an agreement before the end of the year.\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, views the Republicans' openness to adjust or eliminate deductions and loopholes as an opportunity for meaningful agreement. He stated on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that discussing revenue and tax reform invites Republicans to engage in the conversation.\n\nCongressional Republicans are also under pressure to push for deeper, more permanent changes to the federal government's operations. New Republican Governors Association Chairman Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana urged his party to address the root causes of the nation's fiscal problems, suggesting structural changes such as a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, a limit on the growth in government spending, and limiting government spending as a percentage of GDP.\n\nOn Sunday, discussions between the two sides continued, following a meeting at the White House on Wednesday between President Obama and leaders from both parties. The president emphasized the need for \"tough compromises\" to be made and for action to be taken, as tax cuts are set to expire for all taxpayers on Jan. 1 and automatic spending cuts are due to hit most government agencies in the new year.\n\nPresident Obama has called for any deal to include tax increases on families earning more than $250,000 per year, while insisting that tax cuts be preserved for families below that income level. In the days following his re-election victory over Republican Mitt Romney, House Speaker John A. Boehner offered an olive branch to the White House, signaling that some form of revenue increases would be on the table during negotiations.\n\nHowever, several Republicans reiterated their preference for deep spending cuts over focusing on the revenue side. Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho stated on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that increasing taxes today and promising spending cuts in the future does not solve the problem. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia expressed doubt that tax increases would have a real impact on deficit-reduction efforts.\n\nDemocrats, in turn, are using similar arguments to attack the Republican-backed plan of tax reform and closing loopholes. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated that closing loopholes alone would not generate sufficient revenue. She added that the president has been clear that higher-income individuals must pay their fair share.",
    " Title: House Speaker Accuses Attorney General Barr of Lying to Congress, Threatens Contempt Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant escalation of the ongoing conflict between the White House and Democratic lawmakers, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Attorney General William Barr of lying to Congress and threatened to hold him in contempt of Congress. The accusation stems from Barr's testimony regarding interactions with Special Counsel Robert Mueller following the conclusion of the Russia investigation.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have accused Barr of misleading Congress by testifying in April that he was unaware of any concern by the special counsel's team about Barr's initial March 24 characterization of the report. This account led President Donald Trump to claim full exoneration. However, Barr failed to mention a March 27 letter he received from Mueller, which expressed concern that Barr's March 24 account did not \"fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work.\"\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has threatened to hold Barr in contempt of Congress if he does not provide a full, unredacted copy of Mueller's report and the underlying evidence, as the panel has requested by a subpoena with a Wednesday deadline. This could potentially lead to legal steps against the top U.S. law enforcement official.\n\nPelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, accused Barr of lying to lawmakers about interactions with Mueller after the special counsel ended a 22-month investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's candidacy. \"That's a crime,\" Pelosi told reporters, referring to Barr's congressional testimony.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called Pelosi's allegation \"reckless, irresponsible, and false.\"\n\nThe White House has shown no sign of backing down, with White House legal counsel Emmet Flood stating in a defiant letter that Trump has the right to tell advisers not to testify to congressional panels on the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry.\n\nThe dueling statements mark a sharp escalation in the conflict between the White House and Democrats who control the House of Representatives. With Trump seeking re-election next year, Democrats are weighing whether to try to remove the Republican president from office using the impeachment process while pressing forward with demands for information on his taxes, businesses, and other topics.\n\nSeveral Democrats have called on Barr, whom Trump appointed after firing Jeff Sessions as attorney general, to resign. Pelosi and other House Democrats previously cautioned against launching the impeachment process, which would begin in the House but would face long odds of success in the Republican-controlled Senate and could alienate voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHowever, Pelosi said the Trump administration was continuing to ignore congressional subpoenas and noted that Congress launched impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon after he resisted similar demands. Nixon resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal. Pelosi said Trump's \"blanket statement that he's not going to honor any subpoenas is obstruction of justice.\"\n\nTrump told Fox News in an interview on Thursday he was not inclined to let former White House counsel Don McGahn testify before congressional committees. Nadler has issued a subpoena for McGahn to testify in its investigation of possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks at her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 2, 2019. Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nTrump told Fox News that McGahn had already spoken to Mueller's team for 30 hours, and allowing him to testify to Congress would open the door to others being called. Flood reiterated this point in a letter seen by Reuters, stating Trump's decision to let advisers cooperate when Mueller was conducting his investigation did not extend to congressional oversight investigations now that the inquiry had been completed.\n\nFlood also said Mueller's 448-page report suffered from \"an extraordinary legal defect\" by failing to determine whether Trump had committed the crime of obstruction of justice. Mueller \"instead produced a prosecutorial curiosity - part 'truth commission' report and part law school exam paper,\" Flood wrote to Barr in a letter dated a day after the report was released.\n\nDemocrats have argued Trump waived the right to assert executive privilege - which allows a president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government - by allowing advisers to cooperate extensively with Mueller.\n\nBarr canceled his House testimony after clashing with Nadler over the hearing's format, particularly having staff lawyers question him in addition to committee members. Nadler said he would move forward with a contempt citation as soon as Monday.\n\n\"The very system of government of the United States - the system of limited power, the system of not having a president as a dictator - is very much at stake,\" Nadler told reporters after a 15-minute committee session held in place of Barr's appearance. Democrats have said they may issue a subpoena to try to force Barr to testify.\n\nBarr spent four hours before a Republican-led Senate committee on Wednesday defending his handling of Mueller's report and justifying Trump's actions. The report detailed extensive contacts between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow and the campaign's expectation that it would benefit from Russia's actions, which included hacking and propaganda to boost Trump and harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The report also detailed a series of actions Trump took to try to impede the investigation.",

The report, written by Republicans on the committee, does criticize \"poor judgment and ill-considered actions\" by Trump's campaign, as well as the campaign run by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe report states, \"While the Committee found no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the Russian government, the investigation did find poor judgment and ill-considered actions by the Trump and Clinton campaigns.\" The committee had previously revealed in a one-page summary of the report's findings that it had found no evidence of collusion.\n\nThe report also notes that Russia did carry out a \"multi-faceted\" active measures campaign against the U.S. in an effort to \"sow fear and division in American society.\" The committee voted along party lines in March to release its controversial, Republican-authored report, wrapping up a yearlong investigation that was filled with contentious panel infighting.\n\nDemocrats were outraged by the unilateral GOP decision to end the investigation last month, calling the move premature and an attempt to shield the White House from scrutiny. In a statement, Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican leading the investigation, said, \"Today, [the House Intelligence Committee] is able to release a declassified version of our report on the Russia Investigation. With the public release of this report, the American people will have the opportunity to access the information used to draw the conclusions found in last month's findings and recommendations.\"\n\nConaway expressed disappointment with the redactions made by the intelligence community, stating, \"Many of the redactions include information that is publicly available, such as witness names and information previously declassified.\" He added that he would challenge the redactions going forward in the hope of releasing more information.\n\n\"When we started this investigation, we set out to give the American people the answers to the questions they've been asking and we promised to be as transparent as possible in our final report,\" Conaway said. \"I don't believe the information we're releasing today meets that standard, which is why my team and I will continue to challenge the [intelligence community's] many unnecessary redactions with the hopes of releasing more of the report in the coming months.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose Permanent Tax Cuts Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have proposed a new round of deficit-expanding tax cuts, an initiative that some tax experts view as unlikely to become law and primarily aimed at winning votes in the upcoming November 6 elections. The proposed measures, dubbed \"Tax Reform 2.0,\" would make permanent individual income tax cuts approved on a temporary basis in December 2017, eliminate the maximum age for some retirement account contributions, and allow new businesses to write off more start-up costs.\n\nThe bill, authored by House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady, is set for a committee-level vote on Thursday, with a full House vote expected by October 1. The tax cuts passed in December are projected to add an estimated $1.5 trillion over a decade to the federal deficit, the difference between Washington's spending and the taxes it collects. The new round being proposed by Republicans would add a further $576 billion to the deficit, even taking possibly higher economic growth into account, according to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his Republicans are promoting the December tax cuts as a boost to the economy, a key feature of their campaign push to defend their majorities in the House and U.S. Senate against a challenge from Democrats. Democrats argue that the cuts mainly helped the wealthy and corporations.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said, \"With version 2.0 of the GOP tax scam for the rich, Republicans want to add even more to the deficit, and even more to the bank accounts of the wealthiest 1 percent.\"\n\nThe investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods stated in a Monday note to clients, \"Regardless of the merits of the House GOP plan, we view it as a political move ahead of the midterm elections that has no chance of passing Congress in the short term.\"\n\nEven so, Republican lawmakers and strategists hope a new tax debate will amplify the party's upbeat economic message. They cite a report by the Tax Foundation that forecasts the creation of 1.5 million jobs and wage increases if the temporary individual tax cuts are made permanent.\n\nHowever, some Republicans from Democratic-leaning states express concern about the December cap on the federal deduction for state and local tax payments, known as SALT. A dozen House Republicans opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December. All but one were from high-tax Democratic states such as New York, New Jersey, and California. The new package would make the capped SALT deduction permanent.\n\nUnder Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, the federal deficit has begun growing rapidly again and is expected to exceed $1 trillion in 2019. If that happens, it would be the first time since 2012 that the U.S. economy would have to support such a large deficit, highlighting a significant shift for the Republican Party, which once prided itself on fiscal conservatism.",
    " Title: Iran Threatens to Abandon Nuclear Agreement Amid Missile Test and Sanctions Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIran has threatened to withdraw from the nuclear agreement reached last year with global powers, following a ballistic missile test that violates United Nations Security Council resolutions. The test, Iran's third since the nuclear deal was announced, occurred hours after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) disclosed that it is prohibited by the nuclear agreement from publicly reporting on potential violations by Iran.\n\nIranian leaders, including Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, have stated that they are prepared to abandon the deal if the United States and other global powers fail to advance Iran's \"national interests.\" Araqchi warned during remarks to a group of Iranian officials in Tehran that if Iran's interests are not met under the nuclear deal, there will be no reason for Iran to continue participating.\n\nThis development comes as the White House has stated that Iran's most recent missile test does not violate the nuclear agreement. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest clarified during a daily briefing that the United Nations is currently investigating whether Iran can be penalized for violating other sanctions or agreements.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani was in Europe in January, securing billions of dollars in new business deals following the lifting of sanctions as a result of the nuclear agreement. If Iran follows through with its threat to withdraw from the deal, it may be challenging for Europe to sever ties entirely should new sanctions be imposed.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Troubled Response to Iraq War Question Raises Questions About His Distance from Brother's Legacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early stages of his potential 2016 presidential campaign, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush's main challenge has come to the forefront: overcoming the emotional ties to his last name and his brother, former President George W. Bush, particularly regarding the Iraq War.\n\nOn Thursday, after three days of inconsistent responses to a simple question, Bush finally stated what many expected him to say from the beginning. \"Knowing what we now know, what would you have done? I would have not engaged. I would not have gone into Iraq,\" Bush said at a campaign stop in Tempe, Arizona, according to The Washington Post.\n\nBush explained that he had struggled with the question, as he did not want to appear ungrateful for the sacrifices made by Americans during the war. However, the episode leaves lingering questions about Bush's willingness to distance himself from his brother in his expected bid for the presidency in 2016.\n\nRepublican candidates running for president or considering it, including Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, have all stated they would not have invaded Iraq.\n\nOn Monday, Bush told Megyn Kelly on Fox News that he would have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion, even given what we know now about the faulty intelligence. The next day, Bush walked back his comment, stating, \"I interpreted the question wrong, I guess.\" When asked again, he demurred, \"I don't know what that decision would have been. That's a hypothetical.\"\n\n\"That's a hypothetical\" is a common dodge used by politicians when they do not want to answer a question. This response made Bush appear unprepared.\n\nFord O'Connell, author of \"Hail Mary: The 10-Step Playbook for Republican Recovery,\" stated, \"Jeb should have been prepared to answer that question the second his brother stepped on Marine One to leave the White House in 2009. You get four or five mulligans on the presidential campaign trail, and he just used one of them up.\"\n\nThe Iraq War remains deeply unpopular with the American public. In June 2014, 75 percent of the US public said the Iraq War was not worth the costs, according to a CBS News/New York Times poll.\n\nThe good news for Bush is that most Americans are not yet paying close attention to the 2016 race. It has been 13 years since he last ran for office, and he is still getting his political sea legs back. Though he is not expected to announce for president until mid-June, he is already running. On Wednesday, he said outright that he was running, then quickly reversed himself.\n\nAt the heart of his campaign lies a paradox: the great blessing and the great burden of the Bush name. His father's presidency (1989-1993) is remembered fondly by the general public, though anti-tax conservatives still remember his breaking of the \"no new taxes\" pledge. Bush's brother's presidency (2001-2009) gets lower marks.\n\nJeb Bush benefits tremendously from the political network his family opens up for him. He could easily out-raise the rest of the GOP field in the early going. He has also assembled an A-list team of advisers. However, his brother's legacy poses a particular burden, not just Iraq but also the economic crisis at the end of his tenure. Jeb appears unwilling to throw brother George under the bus.\n\nThe real story, in fact, may be that Jeb Bush seemed to go out of his way to defend his brother on Iraq. George W. Bush seems acutely aware of the liability he poses to his brother. Last month, at an event in Chicago, he practically gave Jeb permission to disown his record.\n\nIf nothing else, it is already clear that Jeb Bush will not sail to the Republican nomination as his father and brother did back in the day. The theory that he could clear the GOP field by vacuuming up establishment money has already proved false. He leads (barely) in national polls of Republican candidates, but has not broken out of the pack. In any case, it is too soon to put much stock in polls.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush advisers acknowledged that he is skipping the Iowa Straw Poll on Aug. 8, a beauty contest that contains no upside for him, as it favors candidates who appeal to the social conservative base of the Iowa GOP. That's a smart move, analysts say.\n\nBush's real challenge is to present himself as a Republican of the future, not a man burdened by his family's past. With fresh faces like his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Sen. Marco Rubio (R) of Florida, and Gov. Scott Walker (R) of Wisconsin gaining positive notice in the early going, the battle is joined. But so far, Bush is still stumbling over the past.\n\nSome analysts suggest that Bush may be playing a completely different game\u2014that he is just going to say what he thinks, stay true to his family, and let the chips fall where they may. Perhaps this is his way of running \"joyfully,\" as he described his possible campaign in early 2014. \"Let Jeb be Jeb\" is how Bush adviser Mike Murphy described the philosophy to The New York Times last December.\n\nPerhaps this brand of political authenticity will catch hold among Republican voters\u2014and along with it, some of the Bush views that don't fit standard Republican orthodoxy at the moment. Among those are support for \"legalization\" of undocumented immigrants and the Common Core education reforms, as well as an unwillingness to sign anti-tax pledges.\n\nIf Bush somehow manages to bend the GOP in his direction, he could represent the party's future. But that's a big \"if.\"",
    " Title: Businessman Donald Trump Wins Indiana Primary, Marking Historic Moment in Republican Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, businessman Donald Trump has virtually secured the nomination for the Republican Party in the 2016 presidential race. This marks the first time in 75 years that a candidate with no prior political experience has come this close to capturing the nomination of a major national party. The last time this occurred was in 1940 when Wendell Willkie, head of a utilities holding company, won the Republican nomination.\n\nTrump's rise to power signifies more than his business background; he is the most unconventional figure either party has put forward in modern times. Although he will enter the general election as an underdog, there is a significant chance he could win the White House, assuming the role of the most important and powerful office in a fractured world.\n\nIn the coming months, American voters, as well as media personnel, need to carefully evaluate Trump's strengths and weaknesses. As David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN and a White House adviser to four presidents, points out, we still do not know Trump as well as we should despite his dominance of the airwaves.\n\nWhat is clear so far is that millions of voters see in Trump a strong leader who can reverse the national direction, acting as a turnaround CEO. Voters often turn to candidates whose strengths compensate for the weaknesses of the sitting president. Thus, they elected Jimmy Carter due to his honesty, a sharp contrast to the Nixon years. They turned to Ronald Reagan as an antidote to Carter's vacillation. After eight years of George W. Bush's plain talk, voters were inspired by Barack Obama's soaring calls. Now, after the Obama years and a string of broken promises by their own leaders, many Republicans believe Trump understands their frustrations and will act decisively to address them. That he is unconventional and outrageous, according to some voters, indicates he is real, not a phony.",
    " Title: Arizona Warns of Potential Measles Outbreak as Two More Cases Confirmed\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo additional cases of measles were confirmed in Arizona on Tuesday, with one case in Pinal County and another in Phoenix. The outbreak, which has been linked to a family of four who recently traveled to Disneyland in California, has reached a \"critical point,\" according to Will Humble, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe Phoenix-area woman, who was diagnosed with measles, may have exposed as many as 195 children at the Phoenix Children's East Valley Center on Jan. 20 and 21. Maricopa County health officials are currently contacting the children's families. The woman was not an employee at the facility, and it is unclear why she was there.\n\nHealth officials believe the outbreak has the potential to be far worse than Arizona's last measles outbreak in 2008. \"I am certain we will have more (cases) based on the sheer number of people exposed this time,\" Humble said.\n\nThe recent outbreak is thought to have originated at Disneyland before Christmas. As of last week, the California Department of Public Health reported 59 confirmed cases, with 42 linked to Disneyland or California Adventure in Anaheim. The outbreak has spread to Washington, Utah, Colorado, Oregon, and Arizona.\n\nThe Pinal County case also raises the possibility of exposure for other residents or visitors in the area, as the man who is now recovering visited various public locations while still infectious. Officials have compiled a list of businesses where the man visited, including a Kearny, Ariz. gas station and post office.\n\nHealth officials say two doses of the MMR vaccine provide full protection against measles. They recommend that all exposed children who have not had at least one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine stay home from school or daycare for the 21-day incubation period. Exposed adults who were born after 1957, have not had measles, or have had only one MMR vaccine should not go to work or public places for the same 21-day period.\n\nAccording to Pinal County health officials, measles begins with a fever, red and watery eyes, a cough, and a runny nose, followed by a red, raised, and blotchy rash that begins on the head at the hairline and moves to the lower extremities. Symptoms typically appear seven to 12 days after exposure to measles but may take up to 21 days.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services has been in contact with health workers across the state, alerting them to measles symptoms. \"For many clinicians, it's an illness they've never seen,\" Humble said.",
    " Title: Andrew Pollack Discusses Daughter's Death and School Safety in New Book\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sit-down interview with Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, Andrew Pollack, father of Parkland shooting victim Meadow Pollack, discussed his new book detailing his investigation into the events leading to the massacre.\n\n\"I wanted to look into it, I wanted to honor my daughter to see what happened, and how it could happen that I put my daughter in a school, in a nice neighborhood, and then I'm never going to see her again,\" Pollack said. \"I wanted to know the facts. I didn't just listen to mainstream media, I didn't jump on that bandwagon -- and I found out that there was a multitude of failures and policies that lead up to my daughter getting murdered, that the mainstream media didn't want to cover.\"\n\nTitled \"Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies That Created The Parkland Shooter and Endanger America's Students,\" Pollack's book discusses his views on gun control, why he blames Democratic policies for his daughter's murder, and precautions that parents can take to ensure the safety of their children.\n\nPollack argued that new gun control laws are an ineffective solution to the school shooting epidemic, in part because current laws are not being enforced. For example, the Parkland shooter had a violent record, but he was not arrested and therefore able to obtain a weapon legally.\n\n\"To me, gun control would\u2019ve been if they arrested him for punching his mother\u2019s teeth out and he got a background,\" explained Pollack. \"Democrats put these policies in place that don't believe in holding kids accountable or arresting them while they're juveniles...so if they do not arrest them and they do not get a background, then they're able to purchase weapons legally, and a background check is useless.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Fox & Friends\" Monday, Pollack said that banning guns is not the solution, and he encouraged people to look at the \"underlying causes for these shootings.\"\n\n\"They're not addressing mental health...or arresting these people when they make threats...those are the real issues,\" he explained.\n\nResponding to a recent video featuring 2020 Democratic candidates promoting tighter gun control as a safety precaution in schools, Pollack said it made him \"ill.\"\n\n\"My daughter paid the ultimate sacrifice because of those Democratic policies and I've been hurt by the Democrats more than anybody in this country -- and I hold them responsible,\" Pollack said.\n\nPollack met with President Trump five times, he explained, and applauded the President's initiation of a federal school safety commission to investigate what steps need to be taken to ensure safety in schools across the country.\n\nIn his new book, Pollack said he wanted to create a guide for parents to spot warning signs of potential shooters and to explain that Meadow's death was avoidable.\n\n\"[The book is] like a manual or a guide for parents and grandparents to read it and actually look at what happened in Parkland and compare it -- these policies are throughout the whole country,\" Pollack told Fox News' Neil Cavuto in an earlier interview.\n\n\"Uncovering all of this,\" said Pollack, \"it did a lot for me so other parents now can learn from it and that's what brought me to this book. And the book started as just an investigation, but there was so many jaw-dropping failures that I had to educate other parents.\"\n\nDiscussing the book, Cavuto \"dared\" viewers to \"read this book without a box of tissues,\" calling it \"stunning and raw.\"\n\nPollack is just getting started, he explained. He is committed to educating parents across the country on being alert and responsive to potential dangers surrounding their children, so no parent has to experience the pain and grief that continues to haunt him more than a year later.\n\n\"Every time that there's a mass shooting,\" he explained, \"I think about these victims...Like the ones in Walmart or the ones in Virginia at the building where these animals are coming through and they're shooting\u2026and I picture my daughter being a victim.\"\n\nTo watch the full interview with Tomi Lahren and Andrew Pollack, visit Fox Nation.

    " Title: Trump Faces Over 50 Lawsuits in First Two Weeks of Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first two weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump is facing more than 50 lawsuits over White House policies and personal business dealings. This is significantly more than his predecessors faced during their initial days in office. The lawsuits began on Inauguration Day and have continued unabated.\n\nMost of the lawsuits relate to the travel ban on refugees and nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries that Trump implemented on January 27. The lawsuits were filed in 17 different states by doctors, professors, students, individuals fleeing violence, and Iraqis who have worked for the U.S. military. Some were detained in American airports for hours over the weekend, while others were barred overseas from boarding planes bound for the U.S. Two Syrian brothers with visas to enter the country were turned around at Philadelphia International Airport and sent back to Damascus.\n\nHuman rights organizations and attorneys general in five states have joined some of the lawsuits, and their lists of legal grievances are extensive. They allege violations of the First, Fifth, and 14th Amendments, which guarantee religious equality, due process, and equal protection under the law, as well as denials of asylum and discriminatory visa processing.\n\nSan Francisco sued over Trump's directive to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities. Lawyers representing the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued over Trump's alleged conflicts of interest. Deepak Gupta told NPR last week that the lawsuit could have broad implications.\n\n\"This is about testing the proposition that the framers really meant it when they said the president has to have undivided loyalty to the American people and should not have financial entanglements with foreign governments,\" Gupta said.\n\nThe White House is fighting all the lawsuits. Trump describes the ethics suit as \"without merit\" and argues that the immigration orders are necessary to keep the country safe.\n\nThis flurry of litigation far surpasses what other administrations faced. At the same point in Obama's presidency, his administration had been sued just five times. The George W. Bush White House faced only four.\n\n\"The Trump administration may set records in terms of the number of lawsuits filed against the administration, or against President Trump personally,\" says Jonathan Turley, who teaches at the George Washington University Law School.\n\nTurley, who was lead counsel in a case brought by Congress that successfully challenged part of the Affordable Care Act, knows firsthand about suing the president. Legal challenges like that one have become standard procedure in Washington.\n\nPrinceton University political history professor Julian Zelizer says that in an era of heightened partisanship, executive orders are an increasingly popular way to make policy. The Obama administration used them. Now the Trump administration is doing the same. According to Zelizer, Democrats and their allies are pushing back the only way they can: in court. Just like Republicans did.\n\n\"When a president releases an executive order, one of the instant responses is to try to tie it up legally,\" Zelizer says. \"Opponents of President Trump are looking to what the Republicans did in the last few years as a roadmap forward. Conservatives know this can be an incredibly effective tool to stop presidents from doing things that you don't want them to do.\"\n\nTrump is no stranger to litigation. He has been a defendant and a plaintiff in thousands of lawsuits as a real estate developer and reality TV star. His general legal strategy? Fight back.\n\n\"When I get sued, I take it right \u2014 just take it all the way,\" Trump said during the campaign. \"You know what happens? If you settle suits, you get sued more.\"\n\nIn November, though, the then-president-elect did settle lawsuits related to Trump University. Some of the lawsuits from Trump's business career will follow him into office. Turley of George Washington University said that, too, is novel\u2014and could be a distraction for the White House.\n\n\"Those lawsuits that are found to have merit and are based on President Trump's personal conduct are likely to be something of a nuisance,\" Turley said.\n\nThe lawsuits over Trump's executive orders could be significant obstacles to his agenda for years to come. Court hearings on the challenges over his travel ban are already underway across the country.",
    " Title: Trump Cancels Chicago Rally, Blames Protesters; Arrests Made at University of Illinois Event\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events that led to the cancellation of a rally in Chicago, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday attributed the decision to security concerns and later blamed supporters of his Democratic rivals for causing disruptions. Trump tweeted, \"It is (Hillary) Clinton and (Bernie) Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!\"\n\nThe Chicago Police Department reported that four men and a woman were arrested at the rally after brief scuffles broke out at the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion. Four of the individuals were still in police custody on Saturday morning but had not yet been charged, said Officer Jose Estrada, a department spokesman. One individual was given an ordinance citation and released.\n\nHowever, CBS News said its reporter, Sopan Deb, was detained by law enforcement while covering the scene. Another man, activist William Calloway, said he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing. Calloway said police told him they arrested him because he failed to immediately exit the arena after the rally was canceled and guests were ordered to exit. The police department, however, said he was not among the five they had taken into custody. Calloway said that he was arrested by UIC campus police.\n\nCalloway played a prominent role in the court-ordered release of a police video of a white officer fatally shooting a black teenager, which triggered months of protests in the city. Calloway said he believes that his role in the McDonald case may have factored into police detaining him. He said police released him about three hours after taking him into custody.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a police department spokesman, said the Trump campaign did not consult the police department before canceling. \"The decision was made by the campaign on its own,\" Guglielmi said.\n\nTrump held a rally in the Dayton suburb of Vandalia Saturday afternoon and planned an event in Cleveland ahead of primary voting in Ohio on Tuesday. Trump denied some media reports that a rally in Cincinnati on Sunday had been canceled.\n\nAt the Dayton rally, Trump said some of the people taunting and harassing his supporters in Chicago \"represented Bernie, our communist friend.\" Trump also blamed the protesters for Friday's canceled rally, tweeting, \"The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!\"\n\nChaos ensued after organizers announced at 6:30 p.m. that Trump, who never arrived at the pavilion, had scrubbed the event. Some protesters rushed the arena floor in celebration, many shouting, \"Bernie, Bernie\" and \"We stopped Trump!\" Police ejected at least a half dozen anti-Trump demonstrators, including one man who got onto the stage and approached the podium.\n\nJoe Fritz, 20, who came to hear Trump speak, said a woman punched him outside the arena after the rally was canceled. He said the woman, who was with a girl about 10 years old, landed a glancing blow to his chin after he questioned her for yelling epithets toward police and about Trump. \"I told her, 'What kind of example are you setting?'\" Fritz said.\n\nFritz said he and his friend were then surrounded by other anti-Trump protesters who screamed at them before police pulled them out of the crowd. Still, the pushing and shoving was brief, and some protesters said security concerns were overstated.\n\n\"(Trump) felt us tonight and felt our power tonight,\" said Angelica Salazar, 30, of West Chicago, Ill. Salazar, who went to speak out against Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, said she did not feel unsafe.\n\nMatthew Ross, a Chicago activist, said suggestions from Trump that protesters presented a security risk do not hold up. \"Have you seen what his supporters have incited at their rallies?\" asked Ross, who said a Trump supporter threw water on him after it was announced that the rally was canceled. \"I think what [Trump] is doing is inciting violence.\"\n\nAfterward, Trump spoke by phone with several news networks and described many anti-Trump protesters, including those at previous rallies, as violent. \"I just don't want people hurt,\" he told MSNBC. Trump has been criticized about violent comments he and his supporters have made on the campaign trail. When attendees at an event in November kicked a Black Lives Matter activist, Trump said, \"Maybe he should have been roughed up.\"\n\nAnother supporter, John McGraw, sucker-punched a protester at a rally Wednesday in North Carolina. McGraw later told Inside Edition that \"we might have to kill him\" next time the protester shows up. Trump insisted that anti-Trump protesters were instigating incidents at his events. \"I certainly don't incite violence,\" he said. \"If a protester is swinging a fist at a man or a group of men, and if they end up going back, I'm not looking to do him any favors.\"\n\nTrump's rivals for the GOP nomination quickly weighed in on the uproar. Sen. Marco Rubio, speaking Saturday in Florida, blamed the rhetoric of the front-runner for the violence, and the media for ignoring his \"offensive\" statements for too long. \"This is what happens when a leading presidential candidate goes around feeding into a narrative of anger and bitterness and frustration,\" Rubio said.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest rival in the race, noted that \"in any campaign, responsibility starts at the top.\" \"When the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence, to punch people in the face, the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates,\" Cruz told reporters in Illinois. \"Today is unlikely to be the last such incidence.\"\n\nFellow GOP candidate John Kasich blamed Friday's events on Trump sowing \"seeds of division.\" \"Some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence, but we can never let that happen,\" the Ohio governor said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the \"divisive rhetoric\" of the Trump campaign should be of \"grave concern.\" \"We all have our differences, and we know many people across the country feel angry,\" Clinton said in a statement. \"We need to address that anger together.\"",
    " Title: Former Attorney General Eric Holder's Controversial Actions and the Resurgence of Polarized Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Human Rights Campaign dinner in Washington on September 15, 2018, former Attorney General Eric Holder was the subject of discussion, rather than the Democratic leaders that some believe he should be. The article, written by an unnamed author, presents a critical view of Holder's actions during his tenure as Attorney General, highlighting instances where he allegedly supported or defended individuals and actions that are perceived as anti-American, extremist, or criminal.\n\nThe article mentions Holder's involvement in commuting the sentences of convicted terrorists, his defense of an al-Qaeda jihadist, and his refusal to cooperate with congressional committees investigating the Fast and Furious gun-walking scheme. The author also points out Holder's history of political corruption, including allegations of helping a Democratic president circumvent the Justice Department in carrying out a pay-to-play pardon.\n\nThe article argues that Holder's actions illustrate two key points. First, it suggests that the high-minded ideals put forth by the hard left are a fraud, and second, it claims that the resurgence of 1970s-style politics, as demonstrated by the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, is not about the individuals involved but about power. The author argues that the character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh was not about Kavanaugh himself but about conveying what Democrats have in store for any conservative who seeks high public office.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that many able, patriotic Democrats are needed to take their party back, referring to those who love America as it is but strive to improve it, not radically alter it. The author suggests that the country needs these Democrats to reclaim the party and move away from the polarized, extremist politics that Holder represents.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Reach Agreement for Return of Seized Navy Drone\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday via Twitter that China will return a U.S. Navy drone seized from international waters. Military officials from both nations confirmed the return of the Navy research drone, which was removed by a Chinese crew on Thursday from the South China Sea.\n\nThe Pentagon reached a deal with the Chinese to return the underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV). Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook stated, \"Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the [UUV] to the United States.\"\n\nChinese military leaders expressed regret over the incident but criticized American leaders for overreacting to the drone's capture. Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Sr. Col. Yang Yujun stated, \"China and the United States have been communicating about this process. It is inappropriate and unhelpful for a resolution that the U.S. has unilaterally hyped up the issue.\"\n\nU.S. military officials did not disclose when or how the drone would be returned but objected to China's \"unlawful seizure\" of their equipment. Negotiations over the transfer of the drone came as President-elect Trump accused China of stealing the research device.\n\nConnecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted that Trump's \"escalation of a diplomatic crisis with China\" was \"madness.\" However, Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain called the incident a \"flagrant violation of the freedom of the seas\" and said Friday the country \"must not stand for such outrageous conduct.\"\n\nA U.S. Navy oceanographic research vessel had deployed the drone about 100 miles from the U.S. Navy base at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Pentagon officials said the drone was merely measuring ocean conditions in the region. However, Chinese officials accused the U.S. of conducting \"surveillance and military surveys\" with the equipment.\n\nTensions between the global powers were already rising when the president-elect received a post-election congratulatory phone call from Taiwan's president last month. Some criticized Trump for breaking diplomatic protocol surrounding the longstanding U.S. \"one China\" policy. Others applauded Trump's boldness.\n\nSome experts speculated China targeted the drone in response to Trump's increasingly confrontational rhetoric. Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interests, told The Hill, \"Knowing Chinese military officials for many years and how orders are communicated from the highest power centers in Beijing down to commanders on the ground or water, this was very likely a highly planned and escalatory move to show China will not take [these] matters lightly.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Rules Partisan Gerrymandering Cases Beyond Federal Courts' Reach\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision on Thursday, ruled that political partisan gerrymandering cases are outside the purview of federal courts. The ruling, which underscores the ideological divide among the nine justices, is expected to have lasting implications.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court's majority opinion that federal courts cannot consider partisan gerrymandering cases. Roberts argued that excessive partisanship in districting leads to results that reasonably seem unjust, but federal judges have no license to reallocate political power between the two major political parties.\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and John Roberts joined Roberts' majority opinion. The liberal members of the court, Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, in a stinging dissent, criticized the ruling, stating, \"For the first time ever, this court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities.\" Kagan added, \"In giving such gerrymanders a pass from judicial review, the majority goes tragically wrong.\"\n\nThe ruling pertains to district maps in Maryland and North Carolina, where Democrats and Republicans, respectively, challenged the maps as instances of unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. The decision also means pending litigation challenging other states' congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders are likely to fail.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights groups have criticized the ruling, claiming it sets a dangerous precedent and allows state maps to be restructured at the will of whichever political party controls the state legislature. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who has focused on fighting partisan gerrymandering since leaving office, decried the ruling, stating, \"This decision tears at the fabric of our democracy and puts the interests of the established few above the many.\"",

John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, stated that Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region, U.S. partners, and the United States.\n\nThe sanctions, which have been in the pipeline for months, do not mention the Iranian nuclear deal, which President Trump attacked during his campaign but has shown no signs of voiding. Smith stated that the U.S. will continue to actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address Iran's behavior.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any property or funds the affected individuals and companies may have under U.S. jurisdiction. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with those on the sanctions list. Trump signaled the sanctions with an early morning tweet: \"Iran is playing with fire \u2014 they don't appreciate how 'kind' President Obama was to them. Not me!\"\n\nIn announcing earlier this week that the administration had put Iran \"on notice,\" Trump and aides cited a recent ballistic missile test as well as supporting a rebel group in Yemen known as the Houthis. The Treasury Department stated that this action reflects the U.S.'s commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region.\n\nIran has denied that its missile tests violate United Nations regulations and generally mocked the president over his criticism. Ali Akbar Velayati, senior adviser to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told the Tasnim news agency this week: \"This is not the first time when an inexperienced man is threatening Iran. The new administration of America will realize that threatening Iran will not work, and empty and baseless ranting should be stopped.\"\n\nThe financial restrictions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement in which the United States and allies drew down sanctions on Iran as it agreed to give up the means to make nuclear weapons. While Trump has questioned whether the agreement can be verified, the Treasury Department said these new sanctions deal with Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups.\n\nThe agreement dealt only with nuclear-related sanctions; other restrictions involving Iranian financial transactions remain. The sanctioned individuals and companies have been linked to Iran's missile program and/or proxies for terrorist activity, such as the Houthis, officials said. They have been identified through an ongoing review of Iranian activity that goes back to the Obama administration.\n\nThe Treasury Department is being led by Acting Secretary Adam J. Szubin, a holdover from the Obama administration who has been involved in sanction activity. Trump's nominee to lead the department, Steve Mnuchin, is awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\n\"These kinds of sanctions do not happen quickly,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, but were triggered by an Iranian missile test and terrorist activities. Officials declined to say whether Trump plans to kill the Iranian nuclear deal\u2014or somehow force Iran to walk away from it\u2014but pledged to keep their eye on the regime.\n\nCalling Iran \"the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism,\" national security adviser Michael Flynn said that \"the international community has been too tolerant of Iran\u2019s bad behavior... The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran\u2019s provocations that threaten our interests.\"\n\nLawmakers generally applauded the sanctions, but questioned some of the administration's saber-rattling toward Iran. \"I urge the Administration to bring clarity to their overall strategy towards Iran,\" said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), \"and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric\u2014or provocative tweets\u2014that will exacerbate efforts to confront those challenges.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Bill Establishing U.S. Space Force as New Military Service\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 on Friday, establishing the U.S. Space Force as the first new military service in over 70 years. The bill, which includes funding for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border fence and reverses automatic spending cuts to defense and domestic programs, was signed at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington.\n\nIn his remarks during the signing ceremony, Trump emphasized the importance of American superiority in space, stating, \"Space is the world's new war-fighting domain. Among grave threats to our national security, American superiority in space is absolutely vital.\"\n\nThe Space Force is not designed for combat operations in space but is intended to more effectively organize for the defense of U.S. interests in space, particularly satellites used for navigation and communication. Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated, \"Our reliance on space-based capabilities has grown dramatically, and today outer space has evolved into a warfighting domain of its own. Maintaining dominance in space will now be Space Force's mission.\"\n\nThe Space Force will be administered by the Secretary of the Air Force, rather than being its own military department like the Navy, Army, and Air Force. The law requires the four-star general who will lead Space Force, with the title of Chief of Space Operations, to be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but not in Space Force's first year. Trump announced that the first leader of Space Force will be Air Force Gen. John W. Raymond, the commander of U.S. Space Command.\n\nSpace Force will provide forces to U.S. Space Command, a separate organization established earlier this year as the overseer of the military's space operations. The division of responsibilities and assets between Space Force and Space Command has not been fully worked out.\n\nSpace Force will initially have about 200 people and a first-year budget of $40 million. Compared to its sister services, Space Force will be tiny, with the military's largest service, the Army, having about 480,000 active-duty soldiers and a budget of about $181 billion. The Pentagon spends about $14 billion a year on space operations, most of which is in the Air Force budget.\n\nKaitlyn Johnson, a space policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees the creation of Space Force as an important move but doubts it will prove as momentous as Trump administration officials suggest. Johnson states, \"I think that's a legitimate concern [for Space Force advocates]. Just because it's written into law doesn't mean it can't be unwritten. Because of the politics that have started to surround the Space Force, I worry that that could damage its impact before it even has time to sort itself out within the wider military bureaucracy.\"\n\nSome in Congress had been advocating for a Space Force before Trump entered the White House, but his push for legislation gave the proposal greater momentum. Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, was initially cool to the idea, arguing against adding new layers of potentially expensive bureaucracy. Mattis' successor, Esper, has been supportive of Space Force. In September, Esper stated, \"The next big fight may very well start in space, and the United States military must be ready.\"",
    " Title: Romney Launches Six-State Bus Tour Ahead of November Election\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, is embarking on a five-day bus tour that will span six battleground states: Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The tour, named \"Every Town Counts,\" is set to commence on Friday in New Hampshire and will conclude on Wednesday.\n\nRomney's campaign has not disclosed specific cities for the tour, but some stops have been reported by local media outlets. The tour will begin in Stratham, N.H., where Romney announced his presidential bid last year, according to The Foster's Daily Democrat. He is also expected to stop in Davenport, Iowa, on Monday, as reported by the Des Moines Register. This will mark Romney's third visit to Iowa since the caucuses. The Detroit News reported that Romney will spend the final night of the tour in Michigan and attend fundraisers on June 20 in Grand Rapids and Troy.\n\nIn a statement, Romney criticized President Obama's administration, stating, \"For three and a half years, President Obama has paid little attention to the everyday concerns of the American people. President Obama has offered no hope for the future, and he has left American families to bear the burden of his failed policies.\"\n\nThe bus tour comes as polls indicate a competitive race in the swing states, with significant ad spending from outside groups and substantial investments by both campaigns. A number of the states Romney will visit were identified by Romney pollster Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies as among the seven key states the campaign needs to win to reach the 270 electoral votes required for a presidential victory.\n\nRecent polls show varying leads in these states. According to a poll by Purple Strategies, Romney is up by three points in Ohio and by four points in Florida, while Obama leads by three points in Virginia and two points in Colorado. An EPIC-MRA poll of Michigan voters released last week showed Romney leading Obama by one point, 46 percent to 45 percent. In April, Obama was ahead in that state by four points, 47 percent to 43 percent.",
    " Title: Celebrities Encourage Voter Registration Ahead of US Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nA number of high-profile celebrities, including Rihanna and Taylor Swift, have been urging their followers to register to vote in the upcoming US midterm elections. The registration period has either ended or is nearing its conclusion in several states ahead of the November elections.\n\nRihanna, with a following of 65 million on Instagram, posted a message to her followers on October 15, urging them to register to vote. She wrote, \"Good Morning America. Who is awake this morning? And who's woke? You have one job today, and that is to properly register to vote.\" She accompanied the post with a picture of the voter registration deadlines in various states.\n\nTaylor Swift, who has a following of 112 million on Instagram, broke her political silence on Sunday, October 7, by endorsing candidates Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the House of Representatives in her home state of Tennessee. She also encouraged her followers to register to vote, writing, \"So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count.\"\n\nSwift's post had a significant impact, with more than 166,000 people registering to vote within 24 hours of the deadline, according to officials. Swift, who is 28, also spoke out during her acceptance speech for Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards on Tuesday. \"This award and every single award given out tonight were voted on by the people,\" Swift said. \"It is the midterm elections on November 6th. Get out and vote.\"\n\nPolitics has also been a topic of discussion within the Kardashian-West family. It was confirmed earlier in the week that Kanye West would meet President Donald Trump for lunch on Thursday. His wife, Kim Kardashian-West, has spoken about using her vote in the past and has encouraged her Twitter followers to do the same ahead of the registration deadline.\n\nChance the Rapper is also actively promoting voter registration. Two years ago, during his US tour, he teamed up with the NAACP to encourage more black people to vote by giving out voter registration forms. This time around, he has been active on Twitter, retweeting activists from his native Chicago who have been explaining the process.\n\nJohn Legend has also been active on social media to promote voter registration. He shared the same graphic as Rihanna and wrote, \"Make sure you're registered. Then vote like our future depends on it!\" Along with endorsing Democrat Stacey Abrams for Governor of Georgia, he has also been campaigning for the reinstatement of voting rights to a number of citizens with criminal convictions in Florida. The amendment would see 1.5 million people given the vote in the state.\n\nA number of other high-profile stars have also joined the campaign, including actors Eva Longoria and Tom Hanks and singers Janelle Monae and Panic at the Disco's Brendan Urie.",
    " Title: Global Unemployment Crisis: ILO Warns of 1.6 Billion Workers in Danger Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe International Labor Organization (ILO) has warned that the global unemployment crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to social and political upheavals if governments do not collaborate to address the issue. The ILO estimates that 1.6 billion workers, representing half the world's workforce, are in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods, with many working in the informal economy, such as migrant workers, gig workers, and service industry staff.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused economic havoc, shuttering businesses and destroying jobs worldwide. In the United States, over 30 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, representing over 15% of the workforce. In Western Europe, joblessness is also increasing. Only government wage-support subsidies have staved off a U.S.-scale spike, by keeping idle or furloughed workers notionally employed. In China, official statistics have reported only a slight uptick in unemployment, but this figure excludes a migrant workforce of nearly 300 million people.\n\nThe ILO's report, released last week, covers the so-called informal economy, encompassing migrant, agricultural, and shift workers in the developing world, as well as gig workers and service-industry staff increasingly predominant in wealthier economies. The ILO found that COVID-19 had left almost all 2 billion of them finding it precariously hard to make ends meet.\n\nThe immediate challenge for governments involves budgeting or printing more money for multitrillion-dollar stimulus programs, like those in the U.S., or salary-support schemes favored in Europe and elsewhere. However, the sums needed for such schemes may grow further.\n\nThe long-term challenge lies in determining how many jobs lost to COVID-19 will be lost for good or at least for a long time after the economic reopenings. This question is particularly acute in the service economy and for the ILO's 1.6 billion strugglers in the informal economy worldwide.\n\nThe economic imponderables, such as the longer-term effects of the blow COVID-19 has dealt to the world economy, through major slowdowns in the U.S. and China, and huge disruptions to international trade, will play a significant role in determining the future of employment.\n\nExamples of the impact of COVID-19 on employment can be seen across Asia, where millions work in garment and other factories that have thrived largely on exports to Europe. Many were suddenly made jobless by COVID-19 shutdowns. The question now will be whether, or how quickly, demand for their products will rebound in a post-pandemic world economy.\n\nIn Europe itself, Greece has so far confounded predictions by avoiding the kind of mass outbreaks that have claimed tens of thousands of lives in Italy, France, and Britain. However, the tourism sector is critical to Greece's economy, employing a fifth of the workforce. The country can only hope not just that airlines and airports reopen, but that the tourists recover a pre-pandemic appetite for air travel.\n\nLong-term mass joblessness, possibly on the scale of the Great Depression in the 1930s, could pose major social and political challenges. Work, especially for those living payday to payday, is essential to economic survival. However, it's also central to people's identity, their sense of self-definition, even self-worth. The human cost of the Great Depression, a period that, like many of great suffering, also produced great insights and works of art, is perhaps chronicled nowhere as searingly as in the pages of John Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath.\"\n\nWhile work can form a core part of a person's identity, worklessness can depress and embitter. A more recent example \u2013 the political fallout from the 2008 world financial crisis \u2013 is a reminder that one result can be a growth in the kind of anger and resentment on which populist strongmen often feed.\n\nThe good news, or so organizations like the ILO are emphasizing, is that the employment crisis caused by COVID-19 is not limited to one country or region. Their hope is that, rather than focus only on the domestic imperative of getting each national economy back on its feet, governments will take shared, international action to address the needs of the \"1.6 billion\" in a post-pandemic world.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee Leaders Stress Bipartisan Approach in Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, emphasized the bipartisan nature of their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election during a press conference on Wednesday. The Senate Intelligence Committee's approach contrasts with the ongoing chaos in the House Intelligence Committee's investigation.\n\nSen. Burr, who chairs the committee, called the investigation \"one of the biggest\" Congress has seen in his 20-plus-year tenure on Capitol Hill. When asked about his past support for President Trump, including his past role as an adviser to his campaign, Sen. Burr joked that he would \"do something I've never done.\"\n\n\"I'll admit that I voted for him,\" he said. \"But I've got a job in the United States Senate. And I take that job extremely seriously.\"\n\n\"It overrides any personal beliefs that I have or loyalties I might have,\" he continued. \"Mark and I might look at politics differently\u2014we do not look at the responsibilities we have on the committee differently. And that's to earn the trust and respect of the intelligence community so they feel open and good about sharing information with us, because that enables us to do our oversight...that much better.\"\n\nSen. Warner added that he has \"confidence\" that the Burr-led committee will \"get to the bottom of this.\"\n\nMeanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes continued his defense of meeting on the White House grounds with a source to get information pertaining to potential surveillance of President Trump and his team. The move has been criticized by many as delegitimizing the integrity of the House investigation into Russia.\n\nFor the two senators, Wednesday's press conference could not have stood in starker contrast to the investigation taking place in the House.\n\n\"We will get to the bottom of this,\" Warner said. \"Richard and I have known each other a long time. And the chairman and I have serious concern about what the Russians have done and continue to do around the world.\"\n\nBurr said the leaders \"can't say enough what the mission of the Senate committee is.\"\n\n\"Which is to look at all activities that Russia might have taken to alter or influence the 2016 elections in the United States,\" Burr continued. \"In addition to that, the mission of the committee is to look at any contacts [either campaign had] with Russian government, Russian government officials, that might have influenced in any way shape or form the election process.\"\n\n\"We take that very seriously,\" he added. \"It's not something that can be done quickly.\"\n\nThe North Carolina Republican promised his committee would look \"anywhere intelligence suggest there might have been any type of relationship or effort to influence US elections.\"\n\nAsked about whether he could definitively rule out any collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials, Burr said it was \"crazy to try to draw conclusions\" at this stage of the investigation, adding that it is unwise to share updates on a \"minute-by-minute\" basis because those bits and pieces are \"not always accurate\" once further intelligence is uncovered.\n\nThe House investigation, for the past week, has seemingly been operating in a way where such \"minute-by-minute\" revelations are being made, starting with Nunes' first briefing with reporters last week. Burr said his committee would not be asking the House to play \"any role in our investigation\" and \"we do not plan to play any role in their investigation.\"\n\nWarner insisted that a bipartisan approach is a must for an investigation that has, in many respects, become infected with partisanship elsewhere.\n\n\"If we don't come to some joint conclusion...I think we will not have fulfilled our duty,\" he said, later adding, \"We're going to get it right.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Statements on U.S.-Russia Relations Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a news conference following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018, President Donald Trump faced criticism for his statements regarding the United States and Russia.\n\nTrump's comments, which some perceived as placing blame on both the U.S. and Russia for poor relations, were met with criticism from various political circles. The President stated, \"I hold both countries responsible.\"\n\nThis statement was preceded by a tweet in which Trump expressed similar sentiments, blaming both the U.S. and Russia for the current state of their relationship.\n\nThe U.S.'s meddling in the 2016 election, a topic that Trump has been defensive about, has been a point of contention between the two nations. The allegations of Russian interference in the election have been used to question the legitimacy of Trump's victory.\n\nThe notion that the West, particularly NATO, has provoked Russia by pushing its borders has been a recurring argument. However, James Kirchick of the Brookings Institution has rebutted this claim, stating that there was never any formal agreement that NATO wouldn't expand, and that the expansion occurred after the Soviet Union collapsed, at the behest of new entrants who sought protection from Russian expansionism.\n\nTrump's comments in Helsinki were criticized for their lack of distinction between the U.S. and Russia, with some arguing that the U.S. has not been a threat to Russia. In contrast, Russian President Putin, during a 2002 speech, expressed that every country has the right to choose its own security measures, including the Baltic states, and that NATO is primarily a defensive bloc.\n\nCritics argue that Trump's comments in Helsinki were dismaying, as they stood in stark contrast to Putin's controlled and calculated demeanor. Some have suggested that Trump should take notes from Putin, who, despite his controversial actions, has always been in control during his interactions with other world leaders.",
    " Title: US Job Market Rebounds in March, but Signs Point to Gradual Economic Slowdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy added 196,000 jobs in March, according to the latest report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. This figure represents a significant increase from the 33,000 jobs added in February, although the latter figure saw a slight upward revision from the initial estimate. The robust job growth in March follows an unusually weak job market in February, with hiring remaining the weakest since September 2017.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained at 3.8% in March, a level near historic lows. However, the first-quarter average for job creation stands at 180,000 jobs per month, a decrease from the 223,000 jobs per month on average in 2018. Economists have been expecting a slowdown, and the current trend suggests a gradual economic slowdown rather than a sudden halt.\n\nWhile the March hiring figures are encouraging, they do not indicate a significant shift in the overall economic direction. Paul Ashworth, Chief US Economist at Capital Economics, noted in a note to clients that \"nothing here to shift the dial very far in either direction. But the gradual slowdown in trend employment growth is another sign that the economy is weakening.\"\n\nOne area of concern in the report is wage growth, which came in at 3.2% over the year, lower than the expected 3.4%. Despite sustained periods of low unemployment, the average hourly earnings number suggests the tight labor market is not accelerating wage growth as expected.\n\nManufacturing hiring also showed signs of slowing, with a loss of 6,000 jobs in March, following an addition of only 1,000 jobs in February. The sector experienced a drop in both hourly and weekly earnings. Global manufacturing weakness and mounting tariffs have started to take a toll on the industry, and the shuttering of a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, has not helped.\n\nRetail sector job losses continued in March, with a drop of 12,000 jobs. The labor force shrank slightly more than the number of jobs created in March, according to the household survey, which may indicate that those who remain on the sidelines of the labor market have structural barriers to joining it, such as care responsibilities or transportation challenges.\n\nAnother concerning sign is the median number of weeks that people remain unemployed, which has been ticking up in recent months, suggesting that people are not finding jobs as quickly as they used to after a layoff.\n\nOverall, the US job market rebound in March is a positive development, but the gradual slowdown in job growth and other indicators suggest a weakening economy. The Federal Reserve may consider an interest rate cut later this year in response to the slowdown, but the latest jobs report is unlikely to push them in that direction.",
    " Title: Senate Democrat Questions Cost-Effectiveness and Conflict of Interest in Vice President Pence's Ireland Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence, requesting information regarding the costs of Pence's stay at Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg, Ireland. The Senate Democrat's inquiry follows a visit by Pence in which he held official meetings with Irish leaders and stayed at President Donald Trump's property in the small village of Doonbeg, where his cousin runs a bar and his great-grandmother grew up.\n\nIn the letter, obtained by various media outlets, Sen. Peters expressed concern over the apparent conflict of interest in Pence's decision to stay at a property owned by President Trump, potentially using taxpayer funds to profit the President. He requested specific information on the costs of Pence's stay, including comparable rates for hotels nearby and in Dublin, where Pence held meetings with Irish officials and business leaders.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren also sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, requesting more information about the trip, which she labeled as \"another example of what appears to be open corruption\" in the Trump administration.\n\nPence defended his visit to his family's Irish hometown and staying at President Donald Trump's property there at taxpayer expense, arguing that the resort was a \"logical\" choice that allowed him to highlight Irish-American ties. The vice president held official meetings with Irish leaders in the nation's capital but flew back and forth across the country in Air Force Two to spend nights in Doonbeg.\n\nSen. Peters wrote that he found it hard to believe that Pence's office was unable to identify lodgings that could accommodate the security and logistical needs of the trip in the capital of Ireland. The vice president was accompanied by his mother, wife, and sister on the official trip. Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, stated Tuesday that the vice president was \"personally paying\" for his sister and mother's expenses, according to a reporter traveling with the vice president.\n\nSen. Peters also requested information on Pence's relatives' expenditures and his reimbursements. In his letter, Peters noted that reports claim at least 24 of the 32 individuals who have served in the President's Cabinet have patronized Trump properties, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, another property owned by the President.\n\nSen. Warren wrote in her letter to Pompeo that Pence's stay amounted to a \"transaction.\" She asked Pompeo to provide information about Pence's Doonbeg visit and the State Department's approval of the plans. House Democrats also plan to investigate the matter as part of their probe into violations of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits American office-holders, including the president, from personally profiting from foreign governments.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee announced last week they will investigate any administration plans to host next year's G-7 summit at Trump's Miami resort and golf club. In a statement, Chairman Jerry Nadler and Rep. Steve Cohen said the panel would schedule new hearings and request information from the White House as part of the probe.\n\nAttorney General William Barr is hosting a holiday party at the Trump Hotel in December. However, a Justice Department official told various media outlets that he is paying for the $30,000 holiday party himself, and the purpose of the party is not to curry favor with the president.\n\nWhen asked if the president asked Pence to stay at his property, the vice president's chief of staff, Marc Short, told reporters that he did not think it was \"a request, like a command\" but rather \"a suggestion.\"\n\nEarly Wednesday, the vice president's office followed up with a statement from a spokesperson who said \"the decision to stay at\" the resort \"was solely a decision by the Office of the Vice President and was based on the requirement to find accommodations near the Vice President\u2019s ancestral hometown that could satisfy official meetings on both coasts of the Emerald Isle.\"\n\nTrump on Wednesday said he had \"no involvement\" in Pence's decision to stay at his resort. \"From what I understood, he was going there,\" Trump said. \"Then I heard he was going there, but I did not\u2014it was not my idea for Mike to go there. Mike went there because his family is there. That's my\u2014that's my understanding of it.\"\n\nAsked if he suggested Pence stay there, Trump replied, \"No, I did not\u2014I do not suggest anything.\" The president on Wednesday also denied ever speaking to Barr about using his hotel in Washington. \"With Mike Pence, we never spoke about it, and with Bill, I never spoke about\u2014Attorney General Barr, we never spoke about it,\" Trump said. \"But, that's what they choose.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Budget Deal Faces Challenges in Senate Amidst Political Angst\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans, who have been vocal about a recent rules change that eases the confirmation process for Obama administration appointees, will shift their focus this week to a two-year budget deal crafted by the heads of the House and Senate Budget Committees, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). However, the bipartisan agreement may face a harder path in the Senate, where lawmakers are typically less averse to compromise than their House counterparts.\n\nIn an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, predicted that Democrats will need \"about eight\" Republicans to vote in favor of the deal. With Democrats controlling 55 votes in the Senate (including two independents who usually vote with them), Durbin is likely counting on a few Democratic senators voting \"no\" on the deal. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has scheduled a procedural vote on the measure for Tuesday that will require 60 \"yes\" votes to overcome.\n\nIf Durbin's vote counting is correct, Senate leaders have a long way to go this week. Durbin noted that a handful of senators are vying for the presidency in the future and are considering the vote in that context, while others are afraid of the new political force, the tea party force, the Heritage Foundation force, that is threatening seven out of the 12 Republican senators running for re-election.\n\nMany Republicans have come out against the deal, including Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is up for reelection in 2014. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is one of the only Republican senators who has definitely said he will vote for the deal. In an appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" McCain said he supported it because it undoes some of the budget cuts for defense spending mandated by the sequester.\n\nA handful of other Republicans have said they will vote to end debate on the bill and move to a final vote, but aren't sure yet whether they will be supporting it. Outside conservative groups have come out aggressively against the deal but still found themselves shut out when the House passed it with a solid bipartisan majority that included more than half of the Republican conference.\n\nIf the deal passes both chambers, it will be significant for Congress, which has spent years budgeting by emergency legislation rather than normal order. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) publicly lashed out at the outside conservative groups last week, saying they had \"lost all credibility\" and were just using Republican lawmakers and the American people.\n\nHouse GOP leaders came to the floor to voice support for the deal before their members voted last week, and Durbin said they are also reaching out to some of their Senate colleagues to persuade them to go along. If the deal passes, it could pave the way for the House Ways and Means Committee to advance tax reform legislation in the first quarter of next year, a long-elusive prospect in Washington.\n\nSen. Murray said both parties will need to learn how to trust each other enough to compromise. That's the only way Democrats and Republicans have any hope at striking any more budget deals or confronting the tough fights ahead in 2014, such as the impending debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit. But the deal seems to have provided some hope that compromise is possible. Ryan said the House Ways and Means Committee was planning to advance tax reform legislation in the first quarter of next year.",
    " Title: FDA's Regulation of Dietary Supplements Containing BMPEA Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) slow regulation of dietary supplements containing BMPEA, a stimulant similar to amphetamine, has come under scrutiny following recent reports in The Times. The chemical, BMPEA, is found in weight-loss and workout products, aiming to boost their effectiveness. However, the effectiveness and safety of BMPEA in humans remain unclear, as there have been no tests conducted.\n\nAccording to The Times, the FDA initially suspected that BMPEA had been improperly added to supplements that listed acacia rigidula among their ingredients. Experts suggest that such listings are often attempts by manufacturers to disguise chemical additives as natural botanical extracts. The FDA tested 21 popular supplements that listed acacia rigidula on their labels and found that nine of them contained BMPEA.\n\nDespite these findings, the FDA did not recall the products, issue a health alert, or name them. In contrast, Canadian health authorities deemed the chemical a \"serious health risk\" in December, issued a public health alert, and forced a recall of JetFuel Superburn, which they found to contain BMPEA and another amphetamine-like stimulant.\n\nMuch of the responsibility for the FDA's slow response is attributed to Dr. Daniel Fabricant, who left a senior position at the Natural Products Association, a trade group for supplement makers and sellers, to head the FDA's division of dietary supplement programs in early 2011. He returned to the trade association as its chief executive in the spring of 2014.

    " Title: Democratic Senators to Receive Assurance of Obamacare Exemption for Canceled Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of Democratic senators have received assurance from the Obama administration that individuals who lost their existing health plans due to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) will be eligible for a temporary hardship exemption, allowing them to purchase catastrophic health plans.\n\nIn a letter to six senators, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated, \"I agree with you that these consumers should qualify for this temporary hardship exemption, and I can assure you that the exemption will be available to them.\"\n\nThe specifics of the exemption's implementation remain unclear. However, the response to the Democrats' concerns addresses fears that people who lost coverage due to Obamacare would be left uninsured if they did not find an alternative on state-based markets by Monday, the deadline to have coverage by the new year.\n\nObamacare's requirements that all health plans provide a range of services contributed to many of these policy cancellations. For weeks, the administration and the law's outside defenders have criticized such plans as sub-par and argued that consumers would be better off with their Obamacare-compliant policies.\n\nThe initial concerns were raised by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Each of the senators represents a state served by HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange system that experienced widespread web glitches upon its Oct. 1 debut.\n\nThe Obama administration has stated that the website is functioning much better as of the start of this month. In response to the senators' concerns, they stated, \"We are pleased that the Administration appears to have responded to the concerns we've raised. As a result, this clarifies an option that will help those consumers who have had their plans cancelled this year transition more smoothly into the marketplace.\" The senators added, \"We will closely monitor how the Administration implements this option, and we remain committed to proposing responsible solutions.\"",
    " Title: Study Finds Link Between Perceived Group Deprivation and Nationalism Among White Majority Populations\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study published in the Political Psychology journal has found a correlation between perceptions of group-based deprivation and increased feelings of nationalism among white majority populations. The study, which surveyed over 15,000 New Zealand registered voters, suggests that nationalistic beliefs can serve as a buffer against the negative psychological consequences of perceiving one's own ethnic group as losing out due to policies that help other groups.\n\nThe study, titled \"Group-Based Deprivation and Nationalism: A Test of the Deprivation-Nationalism Hypothesis,\" found that perceptions of group-based deprivation were associated with increased feelings of nationalism, and that nationalistic beliefs increased the psychological wellbeing of those who felt that they were being deprived.\n\nThe term \"intersectionality\" does not appear in the paper, but the study's findings seem to echo the concerns of critics who argue that the promotion of intersectional doctrines, which openly devalue white people, may contribute to the perceived loss of ingroup status among white majority populations.\n\nThe study's authors write, \"What our model shows, for the first time, is that it is possible for a group to feel unfairly treated within a larger political entity (in this case, the nation) and simultaneously identify strongly with that entity.\" They suggest that nationalism can serve as a buffer against the negative psychological consequences of perceiving one's own ethnic group as being deprived.\n\nThe study's findings imply that the rise of nationalism in white-majority countries may be, in part, a reaction to a perceived loss of ingroup status. This suggests that the promotion of intersectional doctrines, which openly devalue white people, may contribute to the rise of nationalism among white majority populations.\n\nThe study's results seem intuitive: if a particular group (of any skin color) is constantly being lectured that they are less worthy than others, and also that complaining about such lectures is itself a symptom of privilege and racism, what other outcome might we realistically expect?\n\nThe study's authors argue that their findings have important implications for understanding the rise of nationalism in white-majority countries, and for developing policies that address the psychological needs of those who feel deprived. They suggest that policies that address group-based deprivation may help to reduce feelings of nationalism and promote greater social cohesion.\n\nThe study's findings are a reminder that the promotion of intersectional doctrines, which openly devalue white people, may contribute to the rise of nationalism among white majority populations. It is important to recognize that everyone, regardless of their skin color, has the potential to feel deprived and to respond with nationalism. Policies that address group-based deprivation may help to reduce feelings of nationalism and promote greater social cohesion.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Differ in Approach to Federal Disaster Relief Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, President Barack Obama has pledged the full resources of the federal government to aid those affected by the storm. During a speech on Tuesday, Obama stated, \"The most important message I have for them is that America's with you. We are standing behind you, and we are going to do everything we can to help you get back on your feet.\"\n\nIn contrast, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, during a canned food drive for storm victims in Ohio on Tuesday, emphasized the importance of individual action and local government efforts. Romney recounted a story from his high school days, where a small group of students managed to clean up a trash-strewn football field by each taking responsibility for a small section.\n\nRomney did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone could replace the government's role in disaster relief, but during a Republican primary debate last year, he argued for a more decentralized approach to disaster relief, stating, \"Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction.\"\n\nState disaster officials have sometimes clashed with the federal government, but President Obama has appointed a disaster professional, Craig Fugate, to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Fugate, who previously ran Florida's emergency agency, understands the states' perspective and has promised to keep red tape to a minimum during the recovery process.\n\nRepublican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey praised the federal response to the storm, stating, \"I have to say, the administration\u2014the president himself and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far.\"\n\nWhile Texas leads the nation in federal disaster declarations, the federal government's role in disaster relief remains a contentious issue for some Republicans, who have suggested cutting the FEMA budget. During the same GOP debate last year, Romney stated, \"We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing.\"\n\nRomney did not address questions about FEMA funding during Tuesday's canned food drive. President Obama will continue to make the case for an active federal role in disaster relief on Wednesday, with a tour of hard-hit New Jersey.",
    " Title: Senator Marco Rubio Vows to Block Spending Bill Unless Obamacare is Defunded\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has pledged not to vote for a short-term spending bill to maintain government operations unless it defunds the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. In a speech at a breakfast event hosted by The Weekly Standard and Concerned Veterans for America, Rubio urged his fellow senators to follow suit.\n\nRubio's statement comes as the enrollment period for the Obamacare health insurance exchanges is set to begin in October. He described the ongoing debate as coinciding with the \"implosion\" of Obamacare.\n\nIn his speech, Rubio praised America's uniqueness while criticizing President Barack Obama's health care law as \"un-implementable.\" He predicted numerous issues during the rollout of Obamacare this fall, such as delays in the readiness of insurance exchanges and the government's inability to verify individuals' income to ensure they are not receiving excessive insurance subsidies.\n\nRubio anticipates a critical moment when members of Congress realize they will lose their federal health insurance plans and be forced to enroll in the exchanges in January, a requirement in the law that was not initially intended to be included in the final legislation.\n\nRubio portrayed the Affordable Care Act as a significant example of the profound philosophical differences between the two major political parties, with budget, environmental, and gun control issues also being key points of contention. In his 20-minute speech, Rubio did not mention immigration, a topic currently under discussion in the House, where he was one of the driving forces behind the bipartisan Senate bill.",
    " Title: Administration Fears Flawed Healthcare Law Component Could Bankrupt Insurance Companies, Jeopardize ObamaCare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has privately expressed concerns that a flawed component of the healthcare law, known as the \"back end,\" could potentially bankrupt insurance companies and jeopardize ObamaCare itself. According to John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis, the administration has been publicly reassuring the public that everything is functioning correctly, only to abruptly terminate contracts with contractors.\n\nTo justify a no-bid contract with Accenture after firing CGI as the lead contractor, the administration released documents from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These documents revealed the administration's worst fears, stating that the problems with the website could put \"the entire health insurance industry at risk,\" potentially leading to their default and disrupting services and coverage for consumers. If the problems were not fixed by mid-March, they could result in financial harm to the government, and the entire healthcare reform program could be jeopardized.\n\nDespite the \"urgent\" need officials cited to keep the system from collapsing, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, stated he was unaware of these statements. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, however, gave an upbeat account in early December, stating, \"I\u2019m thrilled that we \u2019re going to have millions of people for the first time that have health security.\"\n\nShortly after the website went live, it was revealed that a critical part of the system, the \"back end,\" had not even been built yet. Doug Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, explained that the back end is responsible for transmitting information to insurance companies, allowing them to know who the policyholders are and what policies they have selected. However, the back end has not been built, causing massive confusion and missing information for insurance companies regarding who has signed up and what subsidies they are entitled to.\n\nSebelius insisted once again on Wednesday that everything would come together, and insurance companies would receive their payments. \"I mean we will get them paid,\" she said. \"There is no question about that, so we are on track.\" For now, officials concede they are relying on estimates from the insurers.\n\nCritics argue that the administration's reliance on the honor system for payments is problematic, as there is no effective way to match policies, people, and federal subsidies. Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center explained, \"Here's who we think we have, and here's the subsidy we think they're owed. Please send us a check from the treasury.\"\n\nThe administration emphasizes that fixing the site by mid-March is urgent to prevent the system from descending into chaos and threatening the future of ObamaCare. Meanwhile, a new Quinnipiac poll gives the president poor grades for his management of health care, with 59 percent disapproving while 36 percent approve.",
    " Title: CMS Proposes Changes to Obamacare's Risk Adjustment System to Address Insurer Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has released new proposed rules for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), aiming to bolster the law's exchanges that have been facing challenges in attracting health insurance companies. The 294-page rule, titled \"Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2018,\" focuses on changes to the risk adjustment system, a mechanism that distributes risk among participating insurers to ensure no insurer bears an unusually sick and expensive customer base.\n\nThe proposed changes aim to factor in data about prescription drug usage and account for beneficiaries who only enroll for part of the year. The goal is to mitigate the high cost of very sick individuals who rely on expensive drugs and people who are gaming the system by paying for insurance only when they need it.\n\nConcerns have been raised about the specifics of the prescription drug changes, with experts suggesting that doctors might write additional unnecessary prescriptions to get the coding right, potentially increasing overall healthcare spending.\n\nThe new rules are seen as an acknowledgment by the federal government of the problems with the exchanges. Insurers have been dropping out of Obamacare's exchanges, dramatically raising premiums, and implying they might pull out of even more of the health law marketplaces if their premium hikes are blocked.\n\nThe proposed rules are CMS's response to insurer complaints, with the somewhat unusual timing of the release intended to calm insurers. The risk adjustment rules are typically released much later in the year, but with Aetna and other carriers making significant moves to scale back their exchange business, CMS took the step of releasing the proposal now.\n\nWhile the new rules may quell some of the grumbling from insurers, they are unlikely to have a significant impact on the essential problem that insurers operating in Obamacare's exchanges face: a lack of revenue to cover the claims being made by customers. The problem is not the specific rules by which Obamacare's exchanges operate; it is the health mix and number of customers inside the exchanges.\n\nIn summary, the new rules represent small tweaks designed to show insurers that the federal government is still engaged with their business, but the challenges facing Obamacare's exchanges are significant and may not be resolved by these changes alone.",
    " Title: President Obama Discusses Terrorism, NSA, and Other Topics on The Tonight Show\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his sixth appearance on The Tonight Show, President Barack Obama discussed a range of topics, including terrorism, the temporary closure of U.S. embassies, the NSA, and the George Zimmerman trial.\n\nDuring the interview, President Obama emphasized the ongoing threat of terrorism, stating, \"This radical, violent extremism is still out there, and we've got to stay on top of it.\" He also addressed the embassy closures, suggesting that travelers should exercise caution and stay informed about potential dangers before traveling.\n\nRegarding the NSA, Obama stated, \"We do not have a domestic spying program. What we do have are some mechanisms where we can track a phone number or an email address that we know is connected to some sort of terrorist threat.\"\n\nOn the George Zimmerman trial, Obama expressed a desire for due process, stating, \"We don't know yet exactly what he did, other than what he's said on the Internet, and it's important for me not to prejudge something.\"\n\nThe president also addressed the ongoing tension between the U.S. and Russia, particularly in regards to Russia's threat to enforce anti-gay laws at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. He expressed hope that Russia would ensure the Olympics run smoothly and that athletes would be treated equally.\n\nIn lighter moments, Obama praised Senator John McCain, calling him a person of integrity, and joked about the post-White House glow experienced by former presidents and their families. He also spoke about the Trayvon Martin case, expressing empathy for the Martin family and discussing the sensitive nature of the case for African American families.\n\nThe interview concluded with Obama praising Jay Leno and expressing his enjoyment of the show.",
    " Title: Media Struggles to Balance Coverage of President Trump's Unconventional Speeches\n\nArticle:\n\nThe speech delivered by President Donald Trump at his Tuesday evening rally in Milwaukee was, by most standards, an unconventional affair. The president engaged in a lengthy tirade about lightbulbs, toilets, and showers; touted war crimes; joked about a former president being in hell; and expressed a desire to see one of his domestic political opponents imprisoned.\n\nIn an attempt to capture the speech's disconcerting oddness, media outlets face a challenge in describing Trump as he is, as a report that seems to portray the president as foolish or anti-Trump can be perceived as biased. For media outlets that view themselves as impartial, efforts to provide a sober, \"balanced\" look at presidential speeches often result in normalizing behaviors that are far from normal.\n\nA brief report about Trump's Milwaukee speech that aired Wednesday morning on NPR illustrates this phenomenon. The anchor's introduction framed Trump's at times disjointed ramblings as a normal political speech that \"ranged widely,\" and the ensuing report, which originated from member station WUWM Milwaukee Public Radio, characterized his delivery as one in which he \"snapped back at Democrats for bringing impeachment proceedings.\"\n\n\"Trump was taking on Democrats on their own territory,\" the reporter said, when in reality, Trump heaped abuse on them, for instance, suggesting former Vice President Joe Biden is experiencing memory loss.\n\nThis NPR clip illustrates how the media subtly normalizes Trump. His speech last night in Milwaukee, in which he ranted about lightbulbs and toilets, touted war crimes, and joked about a former president being in hell, is presented as a typical political speech.\n\nGeorgetown University public affairs professor Don Moynihan noted on Twitter that NPR's report about the rally \"mentioned specific topics like Iran and impeachment but carefully omitted the insane stuff. This is one way the media strives to present Trump as a normal president.\"\n\nNPR is not alone in this struggle to cover Trump. As I wrote following a previous Trump rally in Wisconsin last April, outlets including CBS, USA Today, the Associated Press, and The Hill failed to mention in their reporting that Trump pushed dozens of lies and incendiary smears during his speech.\n\nThe irony is that the media is one of Trump's foremost targets of abuse. He calls the press the \"enemy of the people,\" yet the very outlets he demeans regularly bend over backward to cover him in the most favorable possible light.\n\nThe disconnect between the real Trump and the whitewashed version that emerges from mainstream reporting was captured nicely by Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor in a piece she wrote last September headlined, \"As a foreign reporter visiting the US I was stunned by Trump's press conference.\"\n\n\"I've read so many stories about his bluster and boasting and ill-founded attacks, I've listened to speeches and hours of analysis, and yet I was still taken back by just how disjointed and meandering the unedited president could sound,\" Taylor wrote. \"I'd understood the dilemma of normalizing Trump's ideas and policies \u2013 the racism, misogyny, and demonization of the free press. But watching just one press conference [in real time] helped me understand how the process of reporting about this president can mask and normalize his full and alarming incoherence.\"\n\nIt is difficult to cover Trump, and it is important to honor the public's trust in the press by providing fair and balanced coverage. However, we also have to pay attention to how much more alarming the unfiltered Trump is when compared to the sanitized version that often emerges in mainstream media reporting. The news moves fast.

The order, which affects nearly 40 million people, was announced Thursday and follows similar measures taken in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area earlier in the week.\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, California has confirmed 675 cases of COVID-19 and 16 deaths from the disease, placing it behind Washington state and New York, where over 5,000 cases have been reported. The order takes effect immediately and will remain in place indefinitely, with Governor Newsom stating that officials \"could not give a deadline that we really could believe in.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles order, which will stay in effect until at least April 19, requires all businesses, including museums, malls, retail stores, and workplaces, to stop operations. Residents are only allowed to leave their homes for essential activities such as picking up food, going to the doctor, or taking a walk in the neighborhood. Businesses will have an additional day to prepare to close, with the order taking effect midnight Thursday.\n\n\"We\u2019ve already radically changed how we live in Los Angeles,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti said during a press briefing. \"We need to be painfully honest tonight that we're about to enter into a new way of living here.\"\n\nThe order comes as health officials across California continue to monitor the spread of the virus.

    " Title: Former U.S. National Security Officials Reject Trump's National Emergency Declaration for Border Wall\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of nearly 60 former senior U.S. national security officials, including former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and John Kerry, former Republican Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and others, have rejected President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration to fund his long-promised border wall. In an 11-page letter, they stated that there is no documented emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe letter, first reported by the Washington Post, asserts that diverting funds to the project will \"undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.\" Trump moved to redirect federal funds intended for other purposes to build the border wall after Congress rejected his demand for $5.7 billion in construction money.\n\nThe resolution to stop Trump's border emergency is currently being debated in the U.S. House of Representatives, with a vote scheduled for Tuesday. The resolution's fate is less clear in the U.S. Senate, though some Republicans have expressed concern about Trump's declaration. In a separate letter on Monday, 23 former Republican U.S. lawmakers also urged current members of Congress to pass the resolution.\n\nEven if the resolution passes, Trump has stated he would veto it, and Congress would need to muster two-thirds of lawmakers to override a veto. Trump, on Monday, continued to defend the declaration on Twitter, urging Republican senators to stand by him.\n\nThe former security officials, in Monday's letter, cited U.S. government statistics showing illegal border crossings at nearly 40-year lows. They also pointed to other government data on drug trafficking that showed most opioids enter the country via legal entry points, something they said a border wall would not stop.\n\n\"There is no factual basis for the declaration of a national emergency for the purpose of circumventing the appropriations process and reprogramming billions of dollars in funding to construct a wall at the southern border,\" they wrote.\n\nWhile the letter included both Republicans and Democrats, as well as career civil servants who served under presidents of both parties, the bulk of its most senior signatories rose to their top positions under Democratic presidents. Among these former officials were CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, CIA Director John Brennan, White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Deputy CIA Director David Cohen, all of whom held those posts under Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nHowever, the list also included lower-level former officials such as John Bellinger, a former State Department legal adviser, and Eliot Cohen, a former State Department counselor, both of whom served under Republican President George W. Bush.",
    " Title: U.S. Senators Request Criminal Investigation into Ex-MI6 Officer over Alleged False Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo senior U.S. senators, Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, have called for a criminal investigation into former MI6 officer Christopher Steele over a dossier he compiled regarding President Trump's alleged Russian links. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, the Republicans found that Steele had shared details from the dossier with \"multiple U.S. news outlets.\"\n\nThis revelation could suggest that Steele may have made \"false statements\" during his FBI interviews. The senators have since handed over the communications to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe dossier, which alleged that Mr. Trump had colluded with Russian officials during his election campaign and that Kremlin spies filmed him with prostitutes at Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2013, has been the subject of numerous official investigations, including one led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Both Moscow and Mr. Trump have denied these allegations.\n\nChuck Grassley, who chairs the committee, stated that the decision to refer the case for criminal investigation was not made lightly but was necessary for \"appropriate review.\" He added, \"After reviewing how Mr. Steele conducted himself in distributing information contained in the dossier and how many stop signs the DoJ ignored in its use of the dossier, I believe that a special counsel needs to review this matter.\"\n\nGrassley further stated, \"The rule of law depends on the government and all who work on its behalf playing by the rules themselves. I hope the Department of Justice will carefully review our letter and take appropriate action.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, Grassley and his colleague Lindsey Graham clarified that they were not alleging that Steele had committed any crime. Instead, they had passed on the information for \"further investigation only.\"\n\nThe Steele dossier, which became public in January 2017, was compiled after an investigation funded by Republicans trying to block Mr. Trump from becoming the party's presidential candidate. Democrats then took over funding the investigation after he was nominated.\n\nChristopher Steele, who founded and runs Orbis Business Intelligence in London, is said to have shared his findings with both U.S. and UK intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. He briefly went into hiding after he was revealed as the dossier's author but subsequently returned to work. The UK law firm representing Mr. Steele declined to comment.",
    " Title: Obama and Holder Call for Reform of Mandatory Minimum Sentencing for Nonviolent Drug Offenders\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has expressed his support for the abolition of mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders, following an announcement by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Monday. Holder's statement signaled a potential shift in federal drug-sentencing policy, which has been criticized as unjust and disproportionately affecting minority communities.\n\nIn his statement, Holder described the current system as \"broken\" and called for Congress to consider and pass bipartisan legislation to provide flexibility for federal judges in sentencing nonviolent offenders. The legislation, introduced by Obama and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, aims to restore judicial discretion in federal cases.\n\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with nearly half of inmates serving time for drug-related crimes. Critics argue that the focus on draconian punishment has done little to enhance public safety and has resulted in decades of damage, particularly to young people.\n\nMany nonviolent offenders find themselves incarcerated for lengthy periods, sometimes for making a single mistake, due to federal mandatory minimum laws implemented in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. These laws forced judges to deliver sentences far lengthier than they would have if allowed to use their own discretion.\n\nThe Associated Press reported this week that, in some cases, young people were sentenced to prison for decades for nonviolent drug crimes, even if they were unaware of the illegal substances in their possession. One such example is the case of a 19-year-old who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy for being in a car where drugs were found.\n\nMandatory minimum sentencing has disproportionately affected minority communities, as these laws often make it impossible for well-meaning judges, law enforcement, and families to do anything to reverse these bad decisions.\n\nOne such victim of these laws is Timothy Tyler, who was sentenced to life in prison for selling LSD to a police informant in 1994. Tyler should have been punished for selling drugs, but he should not have to spend the rest of his life in prison for it. Today, Timothy is 45 and will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, not because a judge thought it was a proper punishment, but because an arbitrary federal law demanded it.\n\nThe president and founder of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Julie Stewart, told Business Insider that Tyler was a \"kid\" who was following the Grateful Dead. She added, \"It always seemed really absurd to me that for this nonviolent guy who was 24 years old, the government could write off his life.\"\n\nNonviolent offenders don't always return to society as normal and productive citizens after serving hard time alongside rapists and murderers. Those who are released after decades of imprisonment often have trouble finding employment and suffer from a host of other problems related to their history.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (Kentucky Republican) has also expressed his support for the reform of mandatory minimum sentencing. He is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees. Obama and Leahy have introduced the Justice Safety Valve Act (S. 619) to permanently restore justice by preserving judicial discretion in federal cases. The legislation aims to be a bipartisan legislative fix to the very problem Holder now addresses.\n\nIt is now the responsibility of Congress to work together to change these laws and protect future generations from the damage caused by mandatory minimum sentencing.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections and Controversial Events: A Look at the Kavanaugh Hearings, Immigration Caravan, and Elizabeth Warren's DNA Test\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections, several controversial events have dominated the headlines, including the immigration caravan from Central America, the contentious confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test results.\n\nThe immigration caravan, consisting of over 5,000 mostly Honduran migrants, has been making its way through Mexico, with plans to cross the U.S. border illegally and seek asylum. The timing of the caravan's arrival has raised questions, as it comes just before the midterms, potentially aimed at creating empathy and swaying voters towards progressive candidates advocating for a more relaxed immigration policy.\n\nThe Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, marked by protests, walkouts, and disruptions, were intended to portray Republican senators as insensitive to sexual assault allegations made against Kavanaugh. However, the lack of corroborating evidence and the ensuing chaos surrounding the hearings may have had the opposite effect on voters.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test results, aimed at proving her Native American heritage, instead confirmed that she is likely less than 1% Native American and not from a U.S. tribe. This revelation has been met with skepticism and criticism, as many Americans question the motives behind her claims.\n\nAs the midterms approach, progressives hope that these public spectacles focusing on feminist, immigrant, and identity issues will galvanize independents and undecided voters. However, the caravan, the Kavanaugh hearings, and the Warren DNA test may serve to remind voters of the importance of border security, due process, and the rule of law, rather than the intended focus on economic issues.\n\nIn the end, the midterms will likely hinge on a variety of factors, and the impact of these events on voter sentiment remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Trump's Presidential Campaign Struggles in Key States Due to Lack of Ground Operations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe term \"Loser\" is a colloquialism used in the political sphere to describe a candidate who spends a significant amount of time criticizing the media. This term was famously applied to Bob Dole during his presidential campaign in 1996, marking the end of his bid for the presidency.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, it is likely that Donald Trump will lose the election, with Hillary Rodham Clinton winning more votes than Trump. This prediction is based on the fact that the type of rhetoric that resonates in conservative circles may not be as popular in the rest of the country, potentially coming off as strange or unsettling. For instance, more people watch the sitcom \"The Middle\" than watch Sean Hannity's nightly Trump-focused show on Fox News.\n\nRecently, Trump has faced criticism for his comments regarding President Obama and the Islamic State. In an attempt to clarify his remarks, his advisor Hugh Hewitt suggested that Trump meant Obama created the conditions for the Islamic State's rise, rather than founding the group itself. However, Trump insisted that he did indeed mean that President Obama is the founder of ISIS.\n\nTrump's campaign has been criticized for its lack of ground operations in key states. As of last week, the Trump campaign had only one staffer in southwest Ohio and one field office in Florida. This lack of presence is contributing to Trump's poor performance in these states, as well as in Virginia, North Carolina, and Colorado, where Clinton leads him by significant margins.\n\nIn addition to the media, Trump has also blamed the media for his perceived negative portrayal, stating that the media is unfair to Republicans. However, it is not the media that is preventing Trump from organizing a presidential campaign, but rather his own campaign's lack of resources and organization.\n\nIt is too early to begin the post-election recriminations, but it is worth noting that Trump's performance in the debates against Hillary Rodham Clinton may be a cause for concern, as he has expressed a desire to avoid the debates. This is in stark contrast to other candidates, such as Ted Cruz, who would likely have welcomed multiple debates.\n\nA correction has been made to a previous statement regarding a quote from Trump complaining to Hannity about media coverage. The quote is a fabrication from a satire columnist.",
    " Title: U.S. and Russia's Role in Syria's Ongoing Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Syrian conflict, with increasing intensity and lethal weapons on both sides, is threatening to undermine diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the crisis. Kofi Annan, the United Nations and Arab League's special envoy, is pressing Damascus to halt the violence and respect a cease-fire. However, if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad does not cease violence by mid-July, the United Nations may end its observer mission in the country.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to advocate for a \"managed transition,\" under which Assad would step aside. Russia's role is considered crucial, and Clinton's claims about helicopter shipments are expected to escalate tensions with Moscow less than a week before President Obama is scheduled to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin at a summit meeting in Mexico.\n\nAdministration officials declined to provide details about the helicopters, citing classified information. However, Pentagon sources suggest that Clinton, in her remarks at a Brookings Institution event, was referring to Russian-made attack helicopters that Syria already owns but has not yet deployed against opposition forces. While these helicopters, known as Mi-24s, are flown by Syrian pilots, Russia supplies spare parts and provides maintenance for them.\n\nThe use of helicopters is contributing to a growing sense that the conflict could be characterized as a civil war. United Nations peacekeeping operations head Herv\u00e9 Ladsous stated, \"The government of Syria lost some large chunks of territories and several cities to the opposition and wants to retake control of these areas. So now we have confirmed reports not only of the use of tanks and artillery, but also attack helicopters.\"\n\nOpposition leaders are wary of the term \"civil war\" because it suggests an even match. Samir Nachar, a member of the Syrian National Council's executive committee, said, \"Civil war will not come suddenly in one day or two or five, but you have to look how things are gradually changing on the ground. Can you say to people, 'Don't defend yourselves?' It is impossible.\"\n\nCouncil members also expressed caution about reading too much into Clinton's claim, suggesting that it was an open secret for months that the Russians were supplying weapons to Syria. There have been repeated reports of Russian armament ships docking in Syria, although Moscow has always denied that they were carrying the arms used to suppress the protests.\n\nIn addition to the United States and Russia, Turkey has been providing support to the opposition, delivering antitank weaponry to the Syrian border, where it is then transferred to smugglers who take it into Syria. The more powerful weapons have been delivered as far south as the suburbs of Damascus, but not into Damascus itself, according to sources in the Syrian National Council.\n\nHowever, the presence of the antitank missiles has not stemmed the violence. On Tuesday, a team of United Nations cease-fire monitors retreated before reaching Al Heffa in the northwest when hostile crowds attacked their vehicles with stones and metal rods. \"The shelling has been continuous,\" said Houran al-Hafawi, a member of the local coordination committee of Al Heffa. \"The Syrian Army is throwing missiles and rockets from helicopters and rocket launchers from the eastern and western entrances.\"\n\nThe debate over Russia's rearming of Syria took an unusual turn on Tuesday when Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, complained that the U.S. military was buying attack helicopters for Afghan security forces from the same Russian weapons company supplying the Assad government. Pentagon press secretary George Little defended the purchases of the Mi-17 helicopters from the Russian company, Rosoboronexport, as important to helping Afghanistan create a credible self-defense force. Little stated, \"It's about equipping the Afghan air force with what they need to ensure that they have the capabilities from an air standpoint to defend themselves.\"",
    " Title: Professor's Predictive Model Suggests High Probability of President Trump's Re-election\n\nArticle:\n\nA political science professor, Helmut Norpoth of Stony Brook University, has predicted that President Donald Trump is likely to be re-elected based on his election prediction model. The professor shared this prediction with the website Mediaite.\n\nIn 2016, Norpoth's model predicted Trump's victory, despite polls indicating otherwise. The university reported that Norpoth gave Trump an 87-99% chance of beating Hillary Clinton nearly a year before the election, a prediction that proved accurate.\n\nThe model, which has correctly predicted 25 out of the last 27 elections, now suggests that President Trump has a 91% chance of being re-elected. The model also indicates that Trump could secure a larger Electoral College majority this time compared to his 2016 victory.\n\nProfessor Norpoth's model emphasizes the importance of a candidate's early enthusiasm in the nominating process, disregarding opinion polls. Currently, polls show Joe Biden leading over Trump, but Norpoth points out that many candidates have led in the polls in the spring but lost in the fall.\n\n\"The terrain of presidential contests is littered with nominees who saw a poll lead in the spring turn to dust in the fall,\" Norpoth said.\n\nWith the election still several months away, polls can change significantly, especially after the candidates hold their nominating conventions and presidential debates. While the Biden campaign has stated that Biden will engage in three debates with Trump, there are concerns about whether these debates will actually take place, given Biden's perceived gaffes, such as those raised by critics regarding his mental abilities.\n\nThe article concludes by encouraging readers to engage in discussions through the publication's social media accounts.",
    " Title: Iranian Oil Tanker Sabiti Hit by Two Explosions Off Saudi Coast\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Iranian oil tanker, the Sabiti, owned by The National Iran Oil Company, was struck by two explosions approximately 60 miles from the port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, around 5am local time on Friday. The incident, which reportedly involved two missiles, caused significant damage to two main storage tanks on board the vessel, resulting in oil leaks into the Red Sea.\n\nThe National Iranian Tanker Company, which owns the vessel, stated that the missiles had damaged the two main storage tanks, causing them to leak into the ocean. The ship remained afloat after the attack and, according to tracking data, has turned around and is heading back towards the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe Sabiti is carrying 1 million barrels of oil and had not transmitted its location for 57 days prior to the explosions. Iranian tankers often turn off their trackers to evade US sanctions on oil exports.\n\nIranian media reported that the blasts occurred around 5am and 5.20am local time. The Nour news agency, which is close to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, stated that the crew of the Sabiti was safe and had managed to get the leak under control.\n\nHowever, the state-owned National Iranian Tanker Company said that contrary to reports, 'there is no fire aboard the ship and the ship is completely stable.' There was no immediate response from Saudi Arabia regarding the reported attack.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is currently positioned near Iran, said authorities there were \"aware of reports of this incident,\" but declined to comment further.\n\nIran has not publicly identified who it believes is responsible for the attack on the Sabiti. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi stated only that the attack was carried out by those committing \"dangerous adventurism.\" Mousavi added that the Sabiti was struck twice in a half-hour span and an investigation was underway.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry has also stated it is too early to assign blame for the attack. The incident follows a series of attacks on tankers, drones, and oil facilities in the region, with many of these incidents being blamed on Iran.\n\nOil prices surged more than two percent following the attack, with Brent crude oil rising 2.3 percent to $60.46, and West Texas Intermediate rising 2.1 percent to $54.69. The Iranian tanker was hit following months of tensions around the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIn May, four tankers\u2014two belonging to Saudi Arabia, one to Norway, and one to the UAE\u2014were struck by explosions near the UAE in the Gulf of Oman. An investigation by the UAE, America, and France concluded that holes in the vessels were likely caused by explosive charges placed near the waterline. The US accused Iran of being responsible for the attacks, though may not have directly carried them out.\n\nThe attacks led to spiraling tensions around the Gulf, which saw Tehran shoot down an American Navy drone, nearly leading to the US bombing Iran. Tensions rose further last month when a Saudi refinery\u2014the world's largest\u2014and oil field were hit by drones and missiles, which the kingdom said were fired by Iran. The explosions shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production\u2014more than 5 percent of global oil supply.\n\nIn May, another four vessels were hit by explosions in the Gulf of Oman, an attack that was also blamed on Iran. Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks, but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Riyadh blamed Tehran. Iran, which supports the Houthis in Yemen's war, has denied any involvement. Instability in the region was sparked when Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, signed under Barack Obama. The deal, which was also backed by European powers including Russia, had promised the regime economic benefits in return for curtailing its nuclear program in a way that would stop it developing weapons. Trump tore up the deal last year by reimposing crippling sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to stop complying with the deal by accelerating its enrichment of uranium and rebuilding stockpiles. The President has said he wants to negotiate a new deal with Tehran, but Iran has refused to enter fresh talks, urging the US to return to the terms of the original deal. While European countries have tried to establish economic measures to skirt the American sanctions, these have been largely ineffective.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses China of Interfering in U.S. Election Over Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of attempting to interfere in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, stating that Beijing wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win to ease pressure on China over trade and other issues. Trump has been critical of China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has resulted in a global death toll of at least 60,000 people in the United States, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 tally, and has caused a deep recession in the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump has been vocal about his belief that China should have informed the world about the virus sooner. When asked about potential consequences for China, Trump said, \"There are many things I can do. We\u2019re looking for what happened.\" He did not offer specifics regarding the use of tariffs or debt write-offs.\n\nChina's foreign ministry stated that it has no interest in interfering in the U.S. presidential election. Spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters during a daily briefing that the Nov. 3 election is the internal affair of the United States, and Beijing hopes Americans will not try to drag China into it.\n\nTrump also discussed the Phase 1 trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, stating that the economic fallout from the virus has \"upset very badly\" the agreement aimed at reducing chronic U.S. trade deficits with China. A senior Trump administration official said an informal \"truce\" in the war of words between Trump and Xi now appears to be over.\n\nTrump and his top aides have increased their anti-China rhetoric but have stopped short of directly criticizing Xi, whom Trump has repeatedly called his \"friend.\" Trump initially praised Xi and his government for their response and \"transparency\" over the virus.\n\nTrump also discussed the defense cooperation agreement with South Korea, stating that Seoul has agreed to pay the United States more money. He would not disclose the amount. The United States stations roughly 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War that ended in an armistice, rather than with a peace treaty.\n\nTrump is leading a triage effort to keep the U.S. economy afloat through stimulus payments to individuals and companies while nudging state governors to carefully reopen their states as new infections decline. Trump sounded wistful about the strong economy before the pandemic, stating, \"We were rocking before this happened. We had the greatest economy in history.\"\n\nTrump's handling of the virus has come under scrutiny, with 43% of Americans approving of his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, according to an \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll from April 27-28. There was some good news in the coronavirus battle on Wednesday, as Gilead Sciences Inc said its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir was showing progress in treating virus victims. Trump has also sought an accelerated timetable on development of a vaccine.\n\nAt the end of the half-hour interview, Trump offered lighthearted remarks about a newly released Navy video purportedly showing an unidentified flying object. \"I just wonder if it\u2019s real,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a hell of a video.\"",
    " Title: Russian Agent Maria Butina Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for Conspiracy\n\nArticle:\n\nA Russian national, Maria Butina, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for conspiracy in a case involving attempts to infiltrate US political groups. Butina, who pleaded not guilty initially, later admitted to a single count of conspiracy in December. The 30-year-old has been in custody since her arrest in July.\n\nButina, speaking in court in Washington DC on Friday, expressed remorse for her actions, stating, \"I destroyed my own life. I came to the United States not under any orders, but with hope, and now nothing remains but penitence.\"\n\nDespite Butina's apology, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan was reportedly unmoved, stating that her actions \"jeopardized\" the country's national security. The judge's sentencing decision complied with the government's sentencing recommendation.\n\nButina was directed by a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative political groups, including an unnamed pro-gun lobbying organization presumed to be the National Rifle Association (NRA), which is allied with President Donald Trump's Republican party.\n\nAs part of a plea deal, Butina agreed to cooperate with investigators. Judge Chutkan noted on Friday that Butina had provided \"substantial assistance\" to law enforcement. Prosecutors expect the deal will provide information about Russia's efforts to interfere in US politics.\n\nButina admitted to working with former Russian lawmaker Alexander Torshin to infiltrate the NRA and pursue backdoor channels of communication to American conservatives who could influence US politics. She failed to report her activities to US authorities, as required by law.\n\nButina faced a maximum of five years in prison. The case has no connection with the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement read in court, one of the prosecutors said Butina had drafted a document called \"Diplomacy Project\" in March 2015, which called for unofficial communication lines between high-ranking US officials and Russia. The Russian Embassy in Washington described Butina as a \"political prisoner\" and demanded her immediate release. The Russian government has previously described the case as \"fabricated.\"",
    " Title: Senior Republicans Break Ranks on Tax Pledge, Raising Questions About Norquist's Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nFor decades, conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist has been known for his pledge to drive Republicans out of office if they did not promise to oppose tax increases. Many lawmakers signed on. However, several senior Republicans are now breaking ranks, willing to consider raising more revenue through taxes as part of a deal with Democrats to avoid a catastrophic budget meltdown.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker states that the only pledge he will keep is his oath of office. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, from Virginia, says no one in his home state is discussing Norquist's pledge, a 1986 invention often referred to as \"The Pledge.\" Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss states he cares more about his country than sticking to Norquist's pledge.\n\nThis shift in stance from senior members of the Republican party, traditionally firm against tax increases, is significant. While GOP leaders maintain they do not want taxes to increase, the reality of a nation in a debt crisis is forcing some to moderate their opposition to any changes in tax payments to fund the government. Republican legislators and Democratic President Barack Obama's White House are currently negotiating details for tax adjustments and spending cuts before automatic, drastic changes occur at the new year.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama acknowledged signing Norquist's pledge but stated, \"We've got to deal with the crisis we face. We've got to deal with the political reality of the president's victory.\"\n\nThe questioning of Norquist's pledge is leading to speculation about his diminishing power within the GOP. Norquist, the head of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, opposes any tax increases, whether through eliminating deductions or raising rates. He has maintained a significant level of influence for years, despite not holding public office.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has dismissed Norquist as \"some random person.\" Nevertheless, Norquist has maintained a certain level of clout for years. Heading into the 2012 elections, 279 lawmakers had signed Norquist's pledge, according to Americans for Tax Reform. However, some who have signed the pledge are having second thoughts. When the new House is seated next year, no more than 212 of them consider themselves bound by the promise.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina stated, \"I agree with Grover, we should not raise rates. But I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we can't cap deductions and buy down debt.\" Rep. Peter King of New York suggested the pledge is only valid for a two-year term. Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, stated the pledge is losing its clout.",
    " Title: Healthcare Funding Continues Ahead of Supreme Court Ruling on Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has distributed over $2.7 billion in grants and awards since the conclusion of oral arguments in the Supreme Court case challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on March 28, according to a review of funding announcements. This is more than double the amount distributed in the three-month period preceding the arguments.\n\nWhile much of this funding was already in the pipeline before March, the timing for the distribution of specific funds is not rigid, allowing the agency flexibility in the types of funds it disperses. The Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision this week.\n\nThe $2.7 billion includes over $90 million in funds for health insurance cooperatives, which HHS announced on Friday. In contrast, the administration distributed approximately $1 billion in grants, loans, and other awards during the three months before the Supreme Court arguments.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson disputed the suggestion that there was any change in the timeline due to the court. \"This story is flat-out wrong. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act more than two years ago, we have worked continuously to implement the law and to educate the American people about the benefits,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSome Republicans have advocated for a halt in the implementation of the ACA until the Supreme Court ruling. Last year, a draft of the House Labor-HHS appropriations bill, which provides funding for health care agencies, would have frozen all spending on health reform until the court ruled. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) has been pushing a bill that would have blocked any further implementation of the law before the ruling.\n\nRep. Denny Rehberg (R-MT), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies, who authored the appropriations bill that would have put implementation funding on hold, criticized the latest HHS spending in a statement.\n\n\"It was irresponsible to spend a single dollar implementing the law before the Supreme Court rules, and I fought hard to prevent that money from being spent,\" Rehberg said.",
    " Title: Biden's Remarks Highlight the Role of Social Norms in Black Political Loyalty and the Consequences of Misunderstanding These Norms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent book, \"Steadfast Democrats,\" Ismail White and Chryl Laird offer insights into the role of social norms in maintaining black support for the Democratic Party. The authors argue that black Americans prioritize group solidarity in party politics, enforcing a partisan loyalty through a process called \"racialized social constraint.\"\n\nThe researchers conducted an experiment during the 2012 presidential election, soliciting a black student convenience sample of 106 participants from a predominantly white university in the Midwest. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups, where they were offered $10 to donate to either President Barack Obama or his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney. The results showed that when black participants were in a room with a black norm enforcer, they donated significantly more money to Obama than when they were alone or with a white norm enforcer.\n\nHowever, Biden's comment, \"If you are for Trump, then you ain't black,\" has sparked controversy, as many black Americans do not believe that white Americans, even Democrats, have the standing to question any black person's \"blackness\" under any circumstances. The authors argue that the black norm of supporting the Democratic Party is aimed at empowering the group, and Biden's comment might have been perceived as suggesting that black Americans are obligated to support him, rather than him being obligated to them for their support.\n\nTo effectively convey his commitment to black Americans, the authors suggest that Biden could signal his commitment to acting on the racial group's behalf. This can take various forms, such as showcasing social connections to prominent black individuals and organizations. Biden has often highlighted his relationship with former president Obama and regularly points to his record by saying, \"The NAACP has endorsed me every time I have run.\"\n\nPolitical scientist Andrea Benjamin's research suggests that such endorsements can influence black voters' decisions, particularly where race is concerned. Additionally, political scientists Christopher Stout and Keith Baker argue that selecting a black woman as his vice presidential nominee would go a long way to show that commitment. This would be especially potent given the fact that black women are a significant force within the Democratic Party.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the role of social norms in black political loyalty is crucial for political candidates, and enforcing these norms by outsiders can lead to controversy. A more prudent course for a candidate would be to elevate into positions of power people who can enforce these norms effectively, signaling their commitment to the black community's interests.",
    " Title: Senate, White House Confident in Kavanaugh's Confirmation Following FBI Supplemental Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee and the White House have expressed confidence in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh following the completion of an FBI supplementary background investigation. In a statement, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley stated that the investigation did not reveal any new information and found no hint of misconduct.\n\nGrassley said, \"I've now received a committee staff briefing on the FBI's supplement to Judge Kavanaugh's background investigation file. There's nothing in it that we didn't already know.\" He further added that the committee and the FBI could not locate any third parties who could attest to the allegations made against Kavanaugh.\n\nThe White House also reviewed the report and, in an official statement, expressed confidence in Kavanaugh's confirmation. Raj Shah, the principal deputy press secretary for the White House, said, \"With Leader McConnell's cloture filing, Senators have been given ample time to review this seventh background investigation.\" He added that this is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record, and over a half million pages of documents.\n\nPresident Trump also weighed in on the matter, calling the Kavanaugh confirmation battle a \"very important time in our country.\" He tweeted, \"Due Process, Fairness and Common Sense are now on trial!\"\n\nThe Senate's decision on Kavanaugh's confirmation is pending. With the completion of the FBI investigation, the Senate has been given ample time to review the additional information before making a decision.",
    " Title: Kavanaugh Hearings: A Test of America's Attitude Towards Women's Rights and Belief in Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, following the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, have sparked a national debate on women's rights, the #MeToo movement, and the belief in allegations. The hearings, which took place on Thursday, have been a test of how far the #MeToo movement has changed America, with progressive and conservative women expressing their views before and after the extraordinary hearing.\n\nProgressive women, already suspicious of Kavanaugh's social values, have escalated their opposition following the sexual assault claims. Julia Peters, a 33-year-old protester in Washington D.C., stated, \"This is not someone we can elect. He will be in there for a lifetime, and we know he does not stand for our values.\"\n\nGrace Perret, a college junior from New Orleans, Louisiana, is concerned about the potential implications of overturning Roe v Wade, a landmark decision that grants the right to abortion. \"This would have devastating implications for poor women especially, who likely cannot afford to travel\" to other states to seek abortions, she explained.\n\nThe promise \"We believe women\" is core for Julia, as she and other protesters aim to support Dr. Ford and express their belief in her allegations. Conservative women, on the other hand, are deeply concerned about what they see as an abuse of the confirmation process.\n\nRachel Gill, a 22-year-old supporter of Kavanaugh, went to Capitol Hill to show her support for the nominee because she believes in the \"principle of innocent until proven guilty.\" \"I absolutely do support women who have come forward to talk about these experiences, but I also think there needs to be proof if you're going to take someone to court,\" she explained.\n\nTalk of a smear campaign against Kavanaugh is common among conservative women, who fear the assault allegations are being weaponized by Democrats to prevent his confirmation. Nancy Wilson, a grandmother of 11, traveled to Washington from Fairfax County, Virginia, with two friends, wearing \"I Stand With Brett\" T-shirts. They explained they believe women are being misused and want Kavanaugh on the court because he is a \"constitutionalist judge.\"\n\nThe hearings have been a moment of reckoning for women's rights in America, with progressive and conservative women expressing their beliefs and emotions. After protesting outside the Senate, Lucy Melchor, a 36-year-old from Chicago, watched the hearings. \"I thought Ms. Ford's testimony was heartbreaking and compelling,\" she said. \"It just reinforced that I believe her.\"\n\nIn contrast, Melchor felt Mr. Kavanaugh's testimony turned the attention away from a woman's claims of sexual assault to his anger about the political process. \"I was really upset by the level of vitriol that he brought to this. It took the focus away from her and put it on politics,\" she said.\n\nWhile progressives found Ms. Ford powerfully believable, conservative women felt exactly the same about Mr. Kavanaugh. Rachel Gill, a supporter of Kavanaugh, stated, \"I think they both believe what they are saying. I believe that Ms. Ford probably was assaulted but not by Mr. Kavanaugh.\"\n\nThe hearings have also been a moment of reckoning for women's rights in America. Democrat Ms. Melchor commented, \"It's now almost a year since the Me Too movement, and if the cards fall onto the side of not believing her story, it's really detrimental for the women who have been assaulted and will be assaulted in the future. It creates fear for them that they won't be believed in the future, and that's what upsets them the most.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Health Care Law: Potential Outcomes and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is eagerly anticipated, with a variety of plausible outcomes based on the arguments presented during the oral arguments. The court has two other rulings still on its docket, including one on the legality of lying about military medals, which may delay the health care ruling's announcement.\n\nA majority on the court might reject the fundamental overhaul of insurance that lies at the heart of the law, finding its individual mandate unconstitutional. They might also dismiss the closely related requirements that insurers cover everybody who applies and not charge sick people more. However, much or even all of the rest of the law might be left to stand if it survives politically.\n\nThe court might go further, declaring that without the insurance provisions, the rest of the statute would never have passed Congress in the first place, and that the whole bill should be rejected. Alternatively, the court might essentially punt, accepting the argument that it was too soon to decide this case. This would keep the bitter partisan debate over the law going full tilt through the November elections and beyond.\n\nAnother possible outcome is that the court might assemble enough votes not to strike down the individual mandate, leaving the whole law standing. Before the oral arguments, many thought this outcome most likely; sharp questioning in the courtroom undermined that expectation, but did not put it completely to rest.\n\nThe court's decision on the expansion of Medicaid could also influence the core issues. The expansion of Medicaid to millions of additional people for whom private insurance is out of reach could help assure that if the law survives, insurance reaches as many people as possible.\n\nOnce the opinions are handed down and posted online, experts will quickly analyze the gist of what the court has wrought. As the scope of their judgment starts to sink in, a much larger public debate will ensue. The words in the lengthy opinions will reverberate in case law for years to come.",
    " Title: Newt Gingrich Discusses Trump's Presidential Campaign, Potential VP Role, and Syrian Refugee Test\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed his support for Donald Trump as a \"necessary candidate\" reflecting a global anti-establishment sentiment. Gingrich also suggested a test to vet Syrian refugees based on Sharia law, stating it as a means to \"vet Muslims if you believe in Western civilization.\"\n\nRegarding Trump's vice presidential running mate, Gingrich stated that Trump will make his choice late next week, possibly on Thursday or Friday, to have a new vice presidential candidate as a positive story leading into the Republican National Convention on Monday. Gingrich mentioned that he has been vetted for the job but has yet to decide whether to partner with Trump if asked.\n\nGingrich also commented on the worldwide movement toward anti-establishment sentiment, citing the British vote to leave the EU and electoral successes in Europe by populists as part of this movement. He described Trump as part of this global movement, stating that the establishment perceives Trump as divisive only because they are facing a popular uprising.\n\nGingrich reiterated his remarks about racism in the United States, stating that white parents cannot know the fears of black parents. He emphasized the need for an open conversation about protecting both the police and the innocent to solve the ongoing issue.\n\nGingrich was attending a giant annual gathering of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran outside Paris, an exile opposition group calling for regime change in Iran based in France. In the interview, Gingrich expressed support for the group as modern Muslims but had less tolerance for some Syrian refugees and other Muslims. He suggested a test on Sharia law to vet Syrian refugees, stating that belief in Islamic law is incompatible with secular law. Gingrich did not elaborate on how such a test would be administered.",
    " Title: New Hampshire Primary: Marco Rubio's Debate Performance Challenged by GOP Rivals\n\nArticle:\n\nMarco Rubio's uneven performance in the recent Republican debate has sparked a renewed effort among three governors to hinder his rise in the race for the GOP presidential nomination. The New Hampshire primary on Tuesday could potentially leave the Republican party with a mix of establishment candidates and no clear favorite to challenge Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the top-two finishers in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nAt the heart of the battle between Rubio and Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush is the question of whether the freshman Florida senator has the experience and policy depth to serve as president, or if he is merely a well-spoken lightweight. Christie launched a series of withering attacks against Rubio in Saturday's debate, and the New Jersey governor criticized Rubio for his reliance on rehearsed talking points.\n\nIn the aftermath of the debate, Christie declared the Republican contest a changed race. \"There was a march amongst some in the chattering class to anoint Sen. Rubio,\" Christie said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I think after last night, that's over.\"\n\nChristie and his fellow governors need a strong showing in New Hampshire, as they have staked their White House hopes on the state. Without a strong showing, each will face significant pressure to drop out, as Republican Party leaders seek to rally around a single candidate who can challenge Cruz and Trump.\n\nTrump has maintained a commanding lead in New Hampshire preference polls for months. Cruz is in the mix with Rubio and the governors, though his campaign is more focused on the Southern states that follow later in the primary calendar.\n\nThe prospect of Trump or Cruz winning the GOP nomination has caused many Republican leaders to express concern, and this anxiety is likely to increase should New Hampshire voters leave Rubio and the governors clustered together in the primary results, failing to anoint one as their preferred challenger to the front-runners.\n\nA Monmouth University survey released Sunday shows Trump with a commanding double-digit lead over his Republican rivals, with 30 percent of likely Republican primary voters saying they would vote for him. However, there is a cluster of candidates statistically tied for second place: Kasich has 14 percent of would-be voters, Rubio came in with 13 percent, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also had 13 percent, and Cruz had 12 percent support.\n\nWhile most candidates remained unchanged in their polling numbers from last month's Monmouth survey, Bush jumped nine points since January. The Monmouth survey indicated that just 9 percent of N.H. Republican voters are undecided.\n\nRubio emerged from Iowa looking as though he was that candidate, with a third-place finish in Iowa that was stronger than expected. However, the Florida senator stumbled in Saturday's debate when challenged about his qualifications, repeatedly falling back on a retort meant to distinguish himself from President Barack Obama, who also won the White House as a first-term senator.\n\nBarbara O'Brien, an undecided voter who had been considering voting for Rubio, was convinced he was not the right choice after the debate. \"He kept saying the same thing over and over again,\" said O'Brien, a 67-year-old from Manchester who is one of New Hampshire's many registered independents. \"He did not look presidential.\"\n\nGOP voter Judy McKenna, 66, had been leaning toward Rubio, but said she was \"disappointed\" in his debate performance. \"The governors all made great points about experience, especially Christie, and Rubio did not have any answer to counter that argument,\" McKenna said.\n\nRubio acknowledged the criticism during a rally in Londonderry on Sunday morning. He then proceeded to repeat the same line that put him in Christie's crosshairs. \"I'm going to say it again,\" he told the audience of more than 800 gathered in a school cafeteria. \"The reason why these things are troubling is because Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. Change the country, not fix it.\"\n\nRubio senior adviser Todd Harris said the candidate's repetition underscores his laser focus on upending the Obama administration's agenda. \"We're going to continue to attack Barack Obama's record over and over and over again,\" Harris said. \"I don't think there is any Republican primary voter who was watching that debate who was saying I wish he would lay off of Barack Obama.\"\n\nSeeking to counter the notion of a misstep, Rubio's campaign said it raised $600,000 during the debate, three times more than it has brought in during previous debates. The fundraising numbers were unverifiable.\n\nThe senator's crowds remained large and enthusiastic on Sunday, and some of the many undecided voters who attended his events said they were more bothered by Christie's aggressive demeanor. \"It was tiresome,\" said Katherine Bringhurst, a 66-year-old retired office manager. She is undecided heading into Tuesday's election, but leaning toward Rubio.\n\nMaria Tourlitis, an independent from Hudson, decided to vote for Rubio after hearing him speak in her hometown on Saturday. As she greeted the senator after the event, she leaned in and said: \"At the next debate, please stand up to Christie.\"\n\nIf Christie's aggressive attacks on Rubio result in his own standing tumbling, it could benefit Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Kasich, the current governor of Ohio. Both stepped back in the debate to allow Christie to take the lead in targeting Rubio, though they were happy to relish in the afterglow.\n\n\"He's a great speaker,\" Bush said of Rubio, his one-time political prot\u00e9g\u00e9, on Fox News Sunday. \"But he came across as totally scripted and kind of robotic.\"\n\nKasich has prided himself on avoiding direct criticism of his rivals during the campaign, and kept up that strategy both in the debate and as he campaigned Sunday. \"Wouldn't it be great if we could win being positive?\" Kasich said on Fox News.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Continues Restrictions on Immigrants Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump Administration has continued to implement restrictions on immigrants during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to pass measures that the administration could not implement prior to the pandemic.\n\nIn the latest example, the CDC recently amended and extended an order to \"suspend the introduction of certain 'covered aliens' into the United States for a period of 30 days.\" According to the CDC, the extension found that the determinations of the March 20, 2020 order remain correct, and further determined that the suspension of introduction of covered aliens should continue for another 30 days based on the increasing numbers of COVID-19 infections in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\n\nThe amendment allows the administration another way to deny entry to anyone trying to escape violence and civil war to seek refuge in the United States. In 2018, the country witnessed similar attacks against immigrant children and their parents, including the caging of children, separation of families, detention of families, and a continued failure to reunite them.\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions orchestrated this new \"zero tolerance\" policy, and later prosecuted everybody caught entering the U.S. as part of the same policy. In addition to the thousands of children separated by their parents, the administration lost track of nearly 6,000 unaccompanied immigrant children.\n\nIn June 2018, the Trump administration ended the policy of family separation but substituted it with a policy of family detention. The closing of the family separation practice only came after enormous pressure from the public. Later that year, Trump directed Sessions to alter a 2015 court order titled Reno v. Flores, also known as the Flores Settlement.\n\nThis settlement gave immigrant children the protection that they will not be detained for more than 20 days. The rule also states that children be released to a licensed care program within those 20 days. However, the administration has attacked both sides of this protection by altering the rule that allows them to detain children for more than 20 days.\n\nThe CDC Amendment and Extension has allowed the administration to rapidly deport children under the context of public health while we are still fighting a pandemic. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrants' Rights Project, said in an interview with CBS that \"this is the most extreme of the Trump administration's anti-children anti-asylum policies...\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) likewise stated that \"the United States government should immediately impose a moratorium on deportations during the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid contributing to the global spread of the virus.\" Despite this, the U.S. ignored the advice from the Human Rights Watch and continued to deport people.\n\nAccording to HRW, \"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out 232 deportation flights to Latin America and Caribbean countries between February 3 and April 24, 2020.\" Some of those that were deported tested positive for COVID-19 and were deported to Mexico, Haiti, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\n\nAnother recent CBS report stated that \"nearly 21,000 removals were carried out in March and April alone, including 899 expulsions of unaccompanied children as young as 10.\" Children who are being processed under the new CDC Amendment are not being allowed to apply for humanitarian protections they had before. Instead, they are being deported to their home countries, which completely ignores due process.\n\nTo receive weekly updates like this in your inbox, subscribe to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 newsletter here.",
    " Title: Job Openings Reach Series High of 5.8 Million in July, According to BLS\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the number of job openings in the United States reached a series high of 5.8 million on the last business day of July. This surpassed the previous high of 5.4 million in May.\n\nThe number of hires and separations decreased slightly to 5.0 million and 4.7 million, respectively. The quits rate remained at 1.9% for a fourth consecutive month, while the layoffs and discharges rate declined to 1.1%.\n\nJob openings increased in July for total private and were little changed for government. Several industries experienced a rise in openings, including professional and business services, accommodation and food services, retail trade, and nondurable goods manufacturing. The Northeast and South regions saw an increase in job openings.\n\nThe number of hires and separations, including quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations, decreased slightly in July. Over the 12 months ending in July, the number of hires was little changed for total nonfarm and total private, and rose for government. The number of hires increased in accommodation and food services and federal government, but fell in construction and arts, entertainment, and recreation.\n\nTotal separations, or turnover, decreased in July for total private and was little changed for government. Quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations all saw little change over the month. Over the 12 months ending in July, the number of quits increased for total nonfarm, total private, and government. The number of quits increased in several industries, with the largest increases occurring in accommodation and food services, state and local government, and educational services.\n\nLayoffs and discharges decreased over the 12 months ending in July for total nonfarm and total private, and were little changed for government. Other separations increased over the 12 months ending in July for total nonfarm and for government, and edged up for total private. Other separations increased in several industries, with the largest changes occurring in construction, health care and social assistance, and accommodation and food services.\n\nThe BLS notes that quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee, while layoffs and discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations include separations due to retirement, death, disability, as well as transfers to other locations of the same firm. Seasonally adjusted estimates of layoffs and discharges are not available for individual industries.",
    " Title: White House Requests $14 Billion in Emergency Funding for Hurricane Harvey Recovery\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has requested an initial $7.85 billion in emergency relief funding from Congress to address the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, with an additional $6.7 billion expected to be requested in a subsequent request. This funding is part of the Trump administration's efforts to respond to the devastation caused by the hurricane.\n\nOriginally, it was anticipated that the president would ask for $5.5 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund and an additional $450 billion for a Small Business Administration (SBA) program. However, according to a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan, the White House budget chief, Mick Mulvaney, is requesting $7.4 billion for the relief fund, with the expected $450 billion for the SBA.\n\nThe letter also asks that an additional $6.7 billion be made available in a stopgap spending measure that Congress must pass by the end of September to keep the government running. In total, the White House is asking for more than $14 billion as a down payment for recovery efforts in the Gulf.\n\nIt is important to note that this requested funding represents only a fraction of the eventual costs of relief efforts in Texas and Louisiana. Congress is currently facing a busy legislative agenda this month, with lawmakers under pressure to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29 and to strike a spending deal to fund the government past the end of the month.\n\nPresident Trump is scheduled to visit Texas for the second time in less than a week on Saturday to assess the damage from the storm, which has left at least 46 people dead and caused billions of dollars in damage. He will also visit Louisiana. The president met with local and state officials in the Corpus Christi area on Tuesday as the storm moved north, hitting the Houston area with a torrent of rain and historic floodwaters.",
    " Title: Justice Department Initiates Process to Ban Bump Stocks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has initiated steps to ban bump stock devices, which are accessories that accelerate the rate of gunfire, making semi-automatic guns fire at a speed similar to fully automatic firearms. This move follows President Trump's signing of an executive order instructing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to regulate these devices.\n\nOn Saturday, Attorney General Sessions announced that his office had submitted a notice to the Office of Management and Budget with the intention of clarifying the definition of \"machinegun\" and adding bump stocks to the list of banned devices. The notice is one of the first steps in the process of banning bump stocks. After approval by the office, the DOJ plans to \"seek to publish this notice as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nThe order, once implemented, would prohibit individuals from owning, selling, and manufacturing bump stocks. President Trump stated, \"President Trump is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety and security of every American and he has directed us to propose a regulation addressing bump stocks.\"\n\nBump stocks were found among the weapons used in the Las Vegas shooting that occurred on October 1, 2017, and resulted in the deaths of 58 people. These bump-fire devices utilize the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to rapidly pull the trigger, mimicking fully automatic firing.\n\nThe Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest in recent U.S. history, rekindled the debate on the legality of bump stocks. Congress banned the sale and manufacture of machine guns for civilian use in 1986, and machine guns in circulation before then are tightly regulated, limited in number, and expensive.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has debated the legality of bump stocks for years, issuing a series of opinions, with the most recent determining that the devices were lawful. The ATF's stance on bump stocks has been a topic of contention, with some arguing that the devices should be classified as machineguns due to their ability to mimic fully automatic firearms.\n\nPresident Trump took on the issue following the Valentine's Day high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Students and gun-control advocates pressured Trump and other lawmakers to reevaluate current gun laws. He announced the order on bump stocks last month after meeting with survivors of the shooting.\n\n\"We must do more to protect our children,\" Trump said, emphasizing that school safety is a top priority of his administration.",
    " Title: Conservative Response to President Obama's Second Inaugural Address Hardens\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing President Barack Obama's second inaugural address, conservative responses have solidified, with many expressing a belief that the president's political stance remains unchanged and unlikely to find common ground with conservatives during his second term.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee and a potential contender for the 2016 GOP nomination, shared this view in a Tuesday interview on The Laura Ingraham Show. Ryan stated that the president's speech did not seem to be an attempt to reach out to political adversaries, as inaugural addresses typically are.\n\nRyan, who is also the chairman of the House Budget Committee, accused Obama of misrepresenting the Republican position on entitlement beneficiaries. Ryan argued that conservatives are not labeling those who receive \"earned entitlements\" like Social Security and Medicare as \"takers,\" but rather focusing on beneficiaries who receive entitlements like Medicaid, which they did not pay for through payroll taxes.\n\nSenate Republicans also alleged on Tuesday that Obama, now freed from the constraints of running for re-election, had revealed his liberal leanings in his speech. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters after senators of both parties left their weekly lunchtime party meetings that Obama's speech indicated a return to the era of liberalism. McConnell stated that if the president pursues a liberal agenda, it would not be designed to unite the country or address the pressing issue of deficit and debt.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-SD) suggested that the president's liberal bent was evident in what he left out of his speech, such as the words \"spending\" and \"debt.\" Thune argued that the biggest threat to America's future is runaway government spending and accumulating debt.\n\nCrossroads GPS, a nonprofit linked to Karl Rove's American Crossroads political action committee, released a new video on Tuesday that sought to criticize Obama by using the words of journalists and pundits who described Obama's speech as embracing a liberal agenda.\n\nThe conservative interpretation of Obama's speech, as expressed by Nicholas Eberstadt, an American Enterprise Institute scholar, provides insight into why the president may be viewed as having antagonized Republicans. Eberstadt detected a take-it-or-leave-it defiance in Obama's speech, suggesting that the president believes the welfare state is no longer up for discussion.\n\nThe reaction to the speech a day after its delivery generally mirrored the immediate GOP response following the speech, according to Roll Call.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus: Presidential Candidates Deliver Closing Arguments Ahead of Monday's Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Iowa caucus approaches on Monday, the remaining Democratic presidential candidates are making their final pitches to voters in the Hawkeye State. Here are the closing arguments from some of the key contenders:\n\nElizabeth Warren:\nDuring a tele-town hall from Washington D.C. earlier this week, Senator Elizabeth Warren emphasized the advantage of women candidates in competitive races. She stated, \"The data shows that women have been outperforming men as candidates in competitive races ever since Donald Trump got in.\" Warren argued that \"2020 is not 2016.\"\n\nAmy Klobuchar:\nSenator Amy Klobuchar made a last-minute trip to a bar in Council Bluffs on Tuesday, where she was met by around 100 supporters. Klobuchar also conducted over 20 TV and newspaper interviews in a span of five days last week to reach voters while participating in the impeachment trial.\n\nBernie Sanders:\nSenator Bernie Sanders' closing argument leans on the consistency of his progressive record and his grassroots movement. During a Wednesday night rally in Iowa City, Sanders, calling in from D.C. during a break from the impeachment trial, outlined his plans as president, including raising the minimum wage, legalizing marijuana, passing his Medicare for All bill, protecting women's reproductive rights, fighting climate change, restricting gun access, and overhauling immigration policy.\n\nJoe Biden:\nJoe Biden has been arguing that he offers stability and will build on the Obama years. He has been itching for a fight with Trump over guns, health care, foreign policy, national security, morality, and personality. Biden stated, \"Trump and I have already gone one round with each other on health care.\"\n\nIn the absence of direct observations, information about the arguments of Pete Buttigieg and other candidates was not available.\n\nThe big picture:\nSome voters are expressing a desire for a more aggressive approach against Trump. Michael Moore, a filmmaker and Sanders' national campaign co-chair, told a rally that Hillary Clinton \"refused\" to go to Wisconsin in 2016 and did not give people a reason to vote for her. Voters, volunteers, and campaign staffers have expressed that the 2016 election still haunts them.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\"I want to start hearing people really hammer on Trump because I think they've taken it too easy,\" said Stuart Howe, an undecided voter met at a Biden campaign stop in Waukee.",
    " Title: Attorney General Holder's Proposed Actions for Ferguson Police Department Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder stated on Friday that he was prepared to utilize all available federal powers to bring the city of Ferguson, Missouri, into compliance with the Constitution. In response to a question about dismantling the police force, Holder suggested that such a move could be taken if necessary, but clarified that the Department of Justice (DOJ) does not have the power to dismantle local police departments without the city's consent.\n\nThe DOJ's approach to working with Ferguson is likely to involve drawing up an agreement where Ferguson's police would remain independent but be monitored by the DOJ. The agreement would be enforced in federal court, and the feds would only take over if the city failed to make the changes outlined in the agreement. This approach is similar to what happened in Oakland in 2012, where the federal government fired the police chief but left the department under the city's control.\n\nIf the Ferguson Police Department is to be dismantled, it will only happen if the city agrees to do so or suggests it as an option. The city would be responsible for organizing a replacement police force, as the DOJ does not have the power to create a new police department.\n\nThe DOJ's report on Ferguson also highlighted significant issues within the municipal court system, including discriminatory practices and Constitutional violations. Disbanding the police department would only address half of the problems identified, as the court system would still require reform.\n\nThe report also noted that the problems in Ferguson are not unique to the city, and that other law enforcement agencies in St. Louis County have contributed to a general distrust of police. If other police departments in the area are not better equipped to handle the situation, a nearby police force may be brought in to take over temporarily or permanently while a new police department is established. However, the report suggests that the problems in the St. Louis area may be more widespread and may require additional investigations and potential lawsuits to address.",
    " Title: Obama's Foreign Policy Legacy: A Blend of Wilsonian and Anti-Wilsonian Elements\n\n Article:\n\n In his new residence at 2446 Belmont Road in Washington D.C., former President Barack Obama will live near the home of Woodrow Wilson, who spent his post-presidential years at 2340 S Street. Wilson's foreign policy failure, the Senate's rejection of the U.S. participation in the League of Nations, is a stark contrast to Obama's departure from office with a sense of admiration for America's global standing.\n\n Two seemingly unimpressed nations are Russia, which is dismembering Ukraine, and China, which is shredding international law by turning the South China Sea into militarized Chinese territory. Obama's policies that brought America to a pinnacle of admiration, as he sees it, were an amalgam of Wilsonian and anti-Wilsonian elements.\n\n Wilson's grand ambition for America was to reorder the world in a way that would make it unnecessary for America to have grand ambitions. He thought America could lead a restful life after strenuous diplomacy had written rules for the game of nations. Many progressives believe in humanity's natural sociability, disposed to believe that peace among nations is natural and spontaneous, or it would be if other nations would cleanse their minds of the superstitions that prevent them from recognizing the universal validity and demonstrable utility of American principles.\n\n Obama seemed to doubt that America has much to teach the world, beyond post-Iraq modesty\u2014herewith his Wilsonian dimension\u2014and the power of diplomacy's soft power to tame the world. Although neither the English nor the American nor the Russian nor the Spanish nor the Chinese civil war was ended by negotiations, Obama thought the especially vicious and complex civil war in Syria's sectarian and tribal society could be ended diplomatically. Russian president Vladimir Putin picked a side and helped it win.\n\n The fact that the world is more disorderly and less lawful than when Obama became president is less his fault than the fault of something about which progressives are skeptical\u2014powerful, unchanging human nature. Humans are, as Job knew, born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward: They are desirous and competitive, and hence are prone to conflict.\n\n In 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, Secretary of State John Kerry was disappointed with Putin, saying, more in sorrow than in anger: \"You just don't in the 21st century behave in 19th-century fashion.\" If you do, you place yourself on \"the wrong side of history.\"\n\n Obama's foreign policy presumed the existence of \"the community of nations.\" Make that History, in progressives' lexicon, a proper noun, an autonomous thing with a mind, or at least a logic, of its own. Kerry's reprimand of Putin expressed a progressive's certitude about progress: The passage of time should ineluctably improve the comportment of nations. Which is why in 1911, the renowned 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, in its entry on torture, said \"the whole subject is one of only historical interest as far as Europe is concerned.\" The Dachau concentration camp was opened in March 1933.\n\n Obama's foreign policy presumed the existence of \"the community of nations.\" But that phrase is worse than hackneyed and sentimental, it is oxymoronic: Different nations affirm different notions of justice; a community consists of people made cohesive by a consensus about the nature of justice.\n\n Obama's second-worst unforced error, second to declaring and then abandoning a \"red line\" about Syrian chemical weapons, was involving the U.S. military in regime change in Libya. Perhaps this venture appealed to him because it was untainted by any discernible connection with American national interest. He conducted it by \"leading from behind,\" which he described as U.S. forces \"being volunteered by others to carry out missions\" in Libya. As George Orwell said, \"The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.\"\n\n Soon, foreign policy will be conducted by a man who, although in 2010 he said WikiLeaks' Julian Assange deserves the death penalty, now seems to trust Assange on the subject of Russian hacking more than he trusts the consensus of the nation's $53 billion civilian intelligence institutions. Time passes and, we are told, brings progress.",
    " Title: California Consumer Privacy Act: The Most Comprehensive U.S. Data Privacy Law\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia has passed a landmark privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which gives residents unprecedented control over their data. The legislation, effective from January 1, 2020, provides California residents with the right to demand companies disclose the information they collect, request a copy of that information, and have their data deleted upon request. Companies are also prohibited from selling information if the consumer instructs them to via a mandatory \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\" link on the company's website.\n\nUnder the new regulations, consumers can receive a copy of their data by sending a verifiable consumer request to a business. Companies are required to comply with the request within 45 days of receipt. In some cases, companies can extend this time period for a maximum of 90 days total. Consumers may only make a request for information twice a year, and only for a 12-month look-back period.\n\nCompanies may face fines of $2,500 to $7,500 per violation of the new law, if the violation is deemed intentional. The CCPA is enforced by the California attorney general.\n\nThe CCPA has often been called \"GDPR-lite,\" bearing resemblance to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in May 2018. The CCPA applies only to businesses with an annual gross revenue in excess of $25m, derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling consumers' personal information, or annually buy, receive, sell, or share the personal information of more than 50,000 consumers, households, or devices for commercial purposes.\n\nThe CCPA provides more explicit \"opt out\" options for users who do not want their personal data sold. Under the CCPA, companies must include a \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\" link in a clear and conspicuous location on their websites. Under GDPR, by comparison, businesses do not necessarily need the individual's consent to collect and use data.\n\nThe rules also differ in their approaches to the collection of children's data. Under GDPR, parents must provide consent for the processing of data of children under the age of 16. The CCPA requires businesses to obtain consent from parents of children ages 13 and under, while kids older than 13 can provide their own consent.\n\nSome advocates argue that the CCPA does not go far enough, as it does not address data collection effectively and California has few resources to enforce the law in 2020. The law as it is written does not require companies to come to consumers to ask for their data, which is what advocates call \"opt in versus opt out.\" Companies that violate the law will also have the \"right to cure,\" meaning they can change their violating policies after they have been apprehended.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Urged to Uphold Voting Rights Act Amidst Modern Voting Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, a pivotal event that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and the Civil Rights Act in 1964, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant political struggle that ensued. The authors emphasize that the VRA's enactment was not an inevitable outcome, but rather the result of bipartisan efforts, particularly by Democrats, who faced political backlash within their party.\n\nFifty years later, the preservation of the VRA may necessitate a similar display of statesmanship from today's Republicans, as efforts to restrict voting rights are predominantly being pursued by Republicans across the United States. Unlike during the most segregated periods, these modern voting restrictions are primarily aimed at suppressing African-American, Latino, and young votes in swing states to manipulate Congress and the White House elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent decision to invalidate Section IV of the VRA, which designated states and localities requiring pre-clearance for changes to voting laws, has left the task of safeguarding minority, young, and elderly voters in the hands of congressional Republicans. In June, the court's conservative majority deemed Section IV unconstitutional, with Chief Justice John Roberts arguing that, \"nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically\" regarding race and voting in America.\n\nHowever, egregious voting restrictions persist in states with a history of voter suppression. Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision, six states with a history of pernicious voting suppression moved to restrict voting rights, unchecked by the preclearance process. Florida, for instance, is considering resuming its voter purge.",
    " Title: Federal Judge's Ruling on NSA's Call-Tracking Program Delays Obama's Surveillance Reform Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge's decision on Monday questioning the constitutionality of the National Security Agency's (NSA) massive call-tracking program has delayed President Barack Obama's decision on surveillance reforms. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon's ruling that the NSA's metadata program appears to violate the Fourth Amendment was issued just three days after a review group established by Obama delivered its report proposing more than 40 changes to the federal government's surveillance programs.\n\nObama was initially expected to review the reform proposals before Christmas and announce which ones he would adopt. However, the White House now says that process won't be complete until sometime next month. The delay gives Leon's decision time to resonate and gives surveillance skeptics more time to pressure Obama to endorse significant reforms after Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA surveillance practices.\n\nLeon's ruling could also create the impression that Obama is less concerned about privacy rights than a conservative judge appointed by a previous president. \"There have been hints of diversity of opinion in [the interagency process], with some people in the White House more pro-privacy and others less so,\" said Michelle Richardson of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is pressing for an end to bulk data collection and for greater safeguards on surveillance.\n\nFormer NSA Director Michael Hayden, a backer of the call-tracking program, also said the new court ruling could shift the balance in favor of more limits on the NSA's work. Obama has already signaled his plans to impose greater limits on the NSA, but the contours of those changes have only been partially decided, White House officials say.\n\nAmong the surveillance doubters who might now have more impact is former Clinton White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, who is set to begin work next month as a counselor to Obama. Podesta has been a longtime privacy advocate and has expressed sympathy with Leon's conclusion that a 34-year-old Supreme Court precedent allowing police to trace a suspected criminal's phone calls without a warrant does not authorize bulk collection of data on virtually every phone call made to, from, or within the U.S.\n\nLeon's decision does not take effect while it is being appealed, and with at least three other lawsuits related to the metadata program in the works, the issue seems highly likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court. However, politically, Leon's ruling could also create the impression that Obama is less concerned about privacy rights than a conservative judge appointed by a previous president.",
    " Title: House Benghazi Committee Reconsiders Pursuit of Hillary Clinton's Email Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nAmid growing accusations from the Democratic party of overreach, especially regarding Hillary Clinton's emails, the House Benghazi Committee is reconsidering the aggressiveness of their investigation into the email scandal that has been a point of contention for the Democratic front-runner. The committee is undecided about whether to call Heather Samuelson, a former Clinton campaign staffer who helped screen Clinton's State Department emails.\n\nThe panel's mandate was to investigate the circumstances surrounding the killing of four Americans outside the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. However, after the revelation that Clinton used a private email server for her State Department correspondence, Republicans on the panel began probing further into whether she had turned over all relevant emails.\n\nThe reevaluation follows a Thursday hearing that was widely seen as a success for Clinton, while Republicans failed to strike any decisive blows. The panel's investigation found about 15 Clinton emails that she never turned over, raising GOP suspicions that more might be missing.\n\nHowever, the email issue only came up briefly at the tail end of her marathon Benghazi hearing. Republicans spent the bulk of their time pressing Clinton over the security failures at the Libyan diplomatic mission and attacking her leadership of the State Department.\n\nCommittee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) has long maintained he's only interested in the emails because he wants to assemble a complete record of Clinton's communications when she ran the State Department. The panel will spend the next few weeks interviewing \"two individuals whose identities must remain secret,\" adding to more than 50 of about 70 they've already completed.\n\nThe committee spent less than 20 minutes on the matter in the 11-hour hearing. Committee spokesman Jamal Ware said the panel will spend the next few weeks interviewing \"two individuals whose identities must remain secret,\" adding to more than 50 of about 70 they've already completed. In the meantime, the committee might not say much about Clinton for a while, at least until the panel's final report.\n\n\"She's an important witness, you can't investigate Benghazi without talking to the secretary of state at the relevant time,\" Gowdy said shortly after the hearing ended on Thursday night. \"In terms of conclusions drawn, I don't draw conclusions until the end... We'll keep going on until we're able to interview all the witnesses that we think have access to relevant information.\"",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Engage in Damage Control and Prepare for Unemployment Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the first presidential debate on Wednesday, both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have entered a period of damage control and preparation for the upcoming monthly unemployment report. The Labor Department is set to release the September jobs numbers on Friday, which will provide an update on the unemployment rate, currently at 8.1 percent.\n\nObama, aiming to support his claim during the debate that the economy is on the rebound, needs to present positive economic statistics, especially since Friday's report will be the last of two monthly snapshots before the November election. Romney, during their first debate in Denver, criticized Obama's economic management, stating, \"The status quo is not going to cut it.\"\n\nFollowing the debate, the Obama campaign announced it would make adjustments and attempt to regain the offensive. At a rally in Denver on Thursday, Obama criticized Romney, stating, \"When I got onto the stage I met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be Mitt Romney, but it couldn't have been Mitt Romney, because the real Mitt Romney has been running around the country for the last year promising $5 trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign responded, accusing Obama of doubling down on \"false attacks.\" Spokesman Ryan Williams stated, \"In full damage-control mode, President Obama today offered no defense of his record and no vision for the future. Rather than a plan to fix our economy, President Obama simply offered more false attacks and renewed his call for job-killing tax hikes.\"\n\nThe explanations from the Obama campaign about what went wrong came as observers from both sides of the political spectrum generally agreed that Romney was the winner of the debate. Romney was quick, polished, and feisty, repeatedly interrupting the moderator and challenging Obama on the facts.\n\nThe candidates will debate again on October 16 and for the last time on October 22. The only vice presidential debate is set for October 11. Each candidate will strive to appeal to middle-class voters, who are likely to decide the election, and make the case for why their plans will boost growth. The debate on Wednesday focused exclusively on domestic matters, with both candidates presenting studies and statistics to support their respective positions.",
    " Title: Illinois Cannabis Consumers and Gun Ownership: A Complicated Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Illinois, where recreational marijuana sales began on January 1, 2020, cannabis consumers will face higher taxes on their purchases compared to consumers in most other states that have legalized marijuana. However, they do not have to worry about state police confiscating their firearms, thanks to protections included in the 2019 Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act.\n\nUnder federal law, anyone who is an \"unlawful user\" of a controlled substance, including marijuana, is prohibited from possessing a firearm. When purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, individuals are required to fill out a form that asks if they are an \"unlawful user\" of marijuana or any other controlled substance. The form includes a warning that marijuana remains unlawful under federal law, regardless of state-level legalization or decriminalization.\n\nA cannabis consumer who possesses a gun is committing a federal felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. A cannabis consumer who answers \"no\" to the question about illegal drug use while buying a gun is also committing a federal felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nIllinois also prohibits anyone who has used an illegal drug during the past year from obtaining a Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) card, which is required to legally own a gun in the state. However, the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act states that a person will not be considered an \"unlawful user\" of marijuana solely due to their possession or use of cannabis in accordance with the Act.\n\nThis week, the Illinois State Police (ISP), which oversees the FOID program, confirmed in a Facebook post that it will not revoke cards \"based solely on a person's legal use of adult-use cannabis.\" The ISP added that it will revoke FOID cards where it is demonstrated that an individual is addicted to or is a habitual user of cannabis. The ISP also warned that the use of cannabis is still considered illegal by the federal government and that the purchase of a firearm from a federally licensed firearms dealer is governed by federal law.\n\nRegarding the risk of buying marijuana from a state-licensed retailer tipping off the federal authorities, the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act states that identifying or personal information of a marijuana purchaser obtained or received in accordance with the Act will not be retained, used, shared, or disclosed for any purpose except as authorized by the Act. Ed Sullivan, a former state legislator who is now a lobbyist for the Illinois State Rifle Association, states that \"no cannabis dispensary can share your personal information, unless you authorize them, [with] anyone or any entity. This includes the Illinois State Police (ISP) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF).\"\n\nHowever, Sullivan notes that the federal government may have access to information about Illinois patients who participate in the state's pre-existing medical marijuana program. \"While Illinois treats cannabis as a prescribed drug, the Federal Government considers cannabis to be a Schedule I narcotic,\" he writes. \"As such, the Federal Government could gain access to your records as a Medical Cannabis User and therefore jeopardize your right to purchase a firearm from a Federal Firearm License [e].\"\n\nSullivan suggests that buying marijuana from recreational dealers may be a safer option for patients concerned about their Second Amendment rights. However, this may not be the case, as the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Act promises that the list of registered patients will be kept \"confidential,\" to be shared only among the state agencies charged with carrying out the law.\n\nWhile both the Illinois State Police and Sullivan focus on gun purchases from federally licensed dealers, the federal law banning firearm possession by cannabis consumers also applies to private transfers or even to continued gun ownership by someone who decides to try marijuana now that it's legal in Illinois. Enforcement in these contexts may be difficult, but the fact remains that millions of gun owners are felons in the eyes of the federal government simply because they use an intoxicant that is legal in states accounting for more than a quarter of the country's population.",
    " Title: Americans Divided on Global Warming, Support for Illegal Immigration Reform and Hagel Confirmation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his second inaugural address, President Barack Obama reiterated his commitment to addressing climate change and illegal immigration, two contentious issues that continue to divide the American public. According to a new national survey by CNN/ORC International, opinions on global warming and illegal immigration are polarized, with a slight majority favoring a path to legal residency for undocumented immigrants and a majority believing global warming is a man-made phenomenon.\n\nThe survey, conducted last week, indicates that 49% of Americans agree with the White House's stance that global warming is a proven fact caused by emissions from cars, power plants, and factories. This is twice the number who believe global warming has not been proven, and the 49% figure is down seven points from 2007. The poll also shows that 24% believe global warming is a proven fact but is not due to man-made sources.\n\nThere is an expected partisan divide on the question, with two-thirds of Democrats saying global warming is man-made, compared to 48% among independent voters and 28% among Republicans. The president has faced challenges in the past in getting climate change legislation through Congress, and his efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform have also been unsuccessful during his first four years in office.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Obama emphasized the need for a more welcoming approach to immigration, stating, \"our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity.\" By a 53% to 43% margin, people questioned in the poll say the main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents, rather than deporting them.\n\nThis is a switch from 2011, when by a 55% to 42% margin, Americans said that deporting undocumented residents and stopping more of them from coming into the country should be the main focus of U.S. policy on illegal immigration. The poll indicates a partisan and generational divide on the issue, with younger people favoring allowing undocumented immigrants to become legal, and a slight plurality of those 50 and older supporting deportation and border security.\n\nOne of the president's biggest domestic accomplishments in his first term was passing the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare.\" According to the poll, 51% favor all or most of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, with 44% opposed to all or most of the provisions in the law. \"That's a switch from 2011, when a CNN poll indicated that a majority opposed all or most of the provisions in the health care bill,\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.\n\nMinutes after his inauguration speech, the president signed documents making official his nominations for some top Cabinet posts, including former Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. Hagel's nomination has been met with reservations and outright opposition by some senators of both parties, who point to past positions he has taken on Israel, Iran, and the war in Iraq. According to the poll, 48% think the Senate should confirm Hagel, which is twice as high as the number who oppose his confirmation, but with three in ten uncertain of how they feel about the issue, the White House might breathe a little easier if support for Hagel were just over 50% rather than just under that mark, adds Holland. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on Jan. 14-15, with 814 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Surveillance of Trump Associates: A Look at the Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent allegations that the Obama administration spied on some of President Trump's associates have sparked a heated debate. However, focusing on the imprecise language in President Trump's tweets may not be the most productive approach. The crux of the matter appears to be that the Obama Justice Department considered a criminal investigation of several Trump associates, which was later converted into an intelligence probe under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nAccording to former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy in National Review, the Obama Justice Department sought FISA surveillance authorization from the FISA court, but the court initially refused permission. The court's refusal is significant, as the FISA court is known for its solicitude towards government requests for national security surveillance.\n\nIn the final weeks of the election, the Obama administration reportedly submitted a narrower request that did not specifically mention Trump. This narrower request was granted by the court, but it is unclear if it involved the tapping of phones, as some reports suggest.\n\nFormer Obama officials have issued denials, which McCarthy describes as \"disingenuous on several levels.\" The Obama administration's claim that President Obama did not \"order\" surveillance of Trump is questionable, as the FISA process is technically the FISA court that \"orders\" surveillance, and the Justice Department, not the White House, represents the government in FISA court proceedings.\n\nJournalist Mickey Kaus suggests that the close relationship between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and President Obama makes it unlikely that this was a rogue operation. Trump has called for a congressional investigation, but some argue that what is needed is a special prosecutor to examine the political abuse of surveillance laws by the Obama administration.\n\nIf the Obama administration did exceed the limits of FISA surveillance, if they lied to the court, or if information was shared within the government or leaked to outsiders, these actions could be serious crimes. The potential political abuses of the Justice Department and the intelligence surveillance process, if proven, would be a significant concern for democracy.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, is a member of the USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

    " Title: Jeffrey Epstein's Death Raises Questions About Prison Conditions and Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe death of Jeffrey Epstein, a former financier accused of sex trafficking, has been reported as a suicide by federal officials. The circumstances surrounding his death have sparked concerns and raised questions about the actions of officials, with members of Congress demanding answers.\n\nEpstein, a high-profile federal prisoner, was found dead in his cell on Saturday morning. The fact that a federal prisoner could commit suicide defies logic, given the high level of security typically associated with such cases.\n\nEpstein's death has led to doubts about the actions of federal officials, with the FBI announcing an investigation. Attorney General William Barr has expressed his dismay, stating that he is \"appalled\" by the circumstances. Members of Congress, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have called for answers regarding Epstein's death.\n\nOne of the key questions arising from Epstein's death is why he was in solitary confinement in the first place, a situation that is considered inappropriate for a prisoner already at risk of suicide. Epstein was indicted this summer on charges of sex trafficking underage girls and had been in federal custody since then.\n\nEpstein attempted suicide less than two weeks ago and was reportedly placed in solitary confinement and under a suicide watch. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which had custody over Epstein, and federal prosecutors were aware of his earlier suicide attempt. However, instead of placing him in an administrative segregation unit or a true suicide watch, they put him in solitary confinement, a decision that has raised questions about his death and the investigation surrounding him.\n\nThe use of solitary confinement in a penal institution is justified when a prisoner poses a threat to the institution, its staff, is an escape risk, or poses a threat to national security. However, in Epstein's case, he was none of the above.\n\nThe conditions of Epstein's confinement have come under scrutiny, with questions about his cell and supervision changes after his first attempt, the level of supervision he received, the objects he was allowed to have, and the response of guards during his death.\n\nThe criminal justice system's flaws and failures in Epstein's case have been a source of concern for many. The use of solitary confinement as a tool to demean, degrade, and demoralize a prisoner has been criticized, with the mind-altering seclusion of \"solitary\" forcing some prisoners into a deep depression from which there is no return.\n\nThe full circumstances surrounding Epstein's death remain unclear, and further investigation is necessary to determine the exact cause of his death. The criminal justice system's handling of Epstein's case has raised questions and concerns, and it is hoped that the ongoing investigation will provide answers and ensure justice for all parties involved.",
    " Title: Justice Department May Pursue Legal Action Against States Over Lockdown Measures, Says Attorney General Barr\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr has indicated that the U.S. Department of Justice may take legal action against governors who maintain strict lockdown measures after coronavirus outbreaks subside. According to a report by Bloomberg News, Barr has expressed concerns that some lockdown measures infringe on Americans' constitutional rights, including bans on attending church and purchasing firearms.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration issued new guidelines last week for states to begin lifting their lockdown measures once they meet certain coronavirus milestones. Barr stated, \"We have to give businesses more freedom to operate in a way that\u2019s reasonably safe. To the extent that governors don\u2019t and impinge on either civil rights or on the national commerce \u2014 our common market that we have here \u2014 then we\u2019ll have to address that.\"\n\nThe federal government may intervene to support any lawsuits against states believed to be pushing lockdown measures too far, with Michigan being a likely candidate. Hundreds of protesters in Michigan have flaunted distancing guidelines, arguing that Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is abusing her authority.\n\nBarr stated, \"We\u2019re looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place. And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they\u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file a statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.\"\n\nMost states have yet to meet the Trump administration's milestones for entering phase one, which recommend at least 14 days of decreasing cases of both coronavirus and flu-like symptoms; hospital workers must be fully equipped with personal protection equipment and ventilators, and there must be an adequate testing system for healthcare workers.\n\nPresident Trump, when announcing the phased reopening plan, stated, \"All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy. It is clear that our strategy is working, and very strongly working. The data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases. Hopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress.\"",
    " Title: Obama Promotes Jobs Plan, Criticizes Washington Distractions Amidst Ongoing Scandals\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama visited Baltimore on Friday, touring Ellicott Dredges, a manufacturing firm for dredging equipment, to promote his jobs plan and criticize lawmakers for focusing on \"chasing every fleeting issue.\" The visit was the second installment of Mr. Obama's \"middle-class jobs and opportunity tour,\" an effort to promote his economic agenda.\n\nDuring his visit, Mr. Obama praised Democratic lawmakers from Maryland for their focus on programs to help the middle class. He did not address the ongoing scandals confronting his administration, such as the IRS and the investigation into the terrorist attack on a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, or the Justice Department leak probe targeting the news media.\n\nHowever, Mr. Obama expressed his frustration with Washington's distractions and partisan games. \"I know it can seem frustrating sometimes when it seems like Washington's priorities aren't the same as your priorities,\" he told plant workers. \"I know it often seems like folks down there are more concerned with their jobs than with yours.\"\n\nThe president advocated for $50 billion of infrastructure improvements but said \"we've had a little difficulty getting our Republican friends to work with us\" to approve the new spending. He announced that he is ordering the federal government to cut red tape to speed up construction projects.\n\n\"We've got to up our game when it comes to infrastructure,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nRepublicans criticized Mr. Obama for not mentioning the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that has been delayed due to environmental concerns. Peter Bowe, president of Ellicott Dredges, testified in favor of the pipeline during a congressional hearing on Thursday, stating that it would create jobs for the company and related industries.\n\nRep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, criticized Mr. Obama for not taking concrete action to create jobs, stating, \"Unfortunately, this visit is just another one of President Obama's campaign-style photo ops. Instead of doing concrete work to create jobs, he's busy giving speeches and taking pictures.\"",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Endorses Ted Cruz for Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz secured the endorsement of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on Tuesday, as all five remaining candidates campaigned in the state ahead of its primary. Walker, a two-term Republican who previously ran for the presidency, announced his support for Cruz over Donald Trump and Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nWalker made the endorsement on Milwaukee conservative talk radio, stating that he believes Cruz is the best-positioned candidate to win the GOP nomination and defeat presumed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Walker's endorsement comes after he had previously stated that only Cruz had a chance to unseat Trump.\n\nTrump, who was scheduled to hold a rally in Janesville, Wisconsin, later in the day, had earlier planned to join Kasich and Cruz for a CNN town hall in Milwaukee. In the Democratic race, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Clinton were campaigning around the state.\n\nWalker, who became the first governor in U.S. history to win a recall election in 2012, had hinted at his support for Cruz last week. When he ended his presidential campaign in September, he called for other candidates to join him to take out Trump.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Walker argued that a governor should be the nominee. However, he chose to support Cruz, who until recently had not received the same level of support from the GOP establishment.\n\n\"It was an easy call for me to support Ted Cruz,\" Walker said, highlighting Cruz's consistent positions and his willingness to stand up for his constituents over the interests in Washington.\n\nCruz supporters cheered as Walker's radio interview was played live at a rally outside of Milwaukee. Trump, in a message posted on Twitter Monday night, made it clear he was not expecting to land Walker's endorsement.\n\n\"After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco, and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!\" Trump wrote, referring specifically to former contenders Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.\n\nIt is unclear how much Walker's endorsement will help Cruz, who has also won the backing of influential conservative talk radio hosts in the Milwaukee market that reach into heavily Republican suburban counties. Walker's approval rating has not exceeded 40 percent in over a year.\n\nWisconsin has 42 delegates, with 18 going to the statewide winner and 24 divided up to the winner in each of the state's eight congressional districts. Kasich has stated he hopes to win in a couple of congressional districts, as Cruz and Trump battle it out to win the state.\n\nKasich was campaigning for votes in suburban Milwaukee, while Cruz appeared with Carly Fiorina at a morning rally. On the Democratic side, Clinton was to appear at a gun violence forum in Milwaukee and then head north to Green Bay and west to La Crosse, which is on the Minnesota border. Sanders was stopping in the Milwaukee area and Appleton.",
    " Title: U.S. and North Korea Agree on Nuclear Talks and Repatriation of Remains in Joint Statement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint statement following the historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, both parties agreed to engage in follow-up nuclear talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top U.S. officials \"at the earliest possible date.\" Additionally, North Korea agreed to recover and repatriate the remains of U.S. soldiers who died during the Korean War.\n\nIn a press conference after the summit, President Trump offered mixed messages about the achievements of the meeting. He described success as developing \"a relationship\" with Kim, characterized the meeting as \"the beginning of an arduous process,\" and stated that Kim had taken only \"the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people.\" At the same time, he described the joint statement as \"very comprehensive\" and argued that \"I don't think you can be any more plain\" in terms of the language on denuclearization. He stated that U.S. officials had worked on the substance of the joint statement for months and that the document was \"far down the line.\"\n\nWhen asked why the document contained no details on how the denuclearization process will work, Trump responded, \"Because there was no time. I'm here one day.\"\n\nPresident Trump maintained that while he had indeed consented to something the North Koreans have long sought\u2014a meeting between their leader and the American president\u2014he didn't view this as a concession and thought it was as beneficial to the United States as it was for North Korea. The United States hasn't given up anything of value to North Korea, he argued, while \"they have given up a tremendous amount.\" He noted that in addition to North Korea committing to \"complete denuclearization\" and recovering the remains of American soldiers, he had secured a verbal promise from Kim Jong Un after the signing ceremony in Singapore to shutter a missile-engine testing site. He also listed a number of notable\u2014if limited and in some cases provisional\u2014gestures of goodwill that North Korea made ahead of the summit: halting missile and nuclear tests, releasing three American hostages, closing a nuclear-test site.\n\nHowever, President Trump then proceeded to, rhetorically at least, make one concession after another to North Korea. He said that U.S. sanctions on North Korea would \"come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor,\" but then chipped away at that firm stance by adding that \"I actually look forward to taking them off\" and that it was \"OK\" that China had recently eased up on sanctions enforcement at its border with North Korea. In announcing that the United States and South Korea would suspend their joint military exercises as long as negotiations progress, he adopted North Korea's longstanding position that these \"war games\" are \"very provocative\" rather than legitimate defensive measures. \"I know a lot about airplanes. It's very expensive,\" he said of the drills, which can involve bombers based in Guam. Trump also hinted that he might eventually fulfill the North's longtime objective of booting U.S. forces from Korea. \"At some point,\" he noted, \"I want to bring our soldiers back home.\"",
    " Title: Senate Impeachment Trial: Democrats Express Second Thoughts as Trial Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2019 House Democratic Caucus' goal, as declared by Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), was to impeach President Donald Trump. The House impeached Trump on a straight party-line vote in December 2019, with no Republican support. As the Senate trial approaches, there appears to be a shift in strategy among Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) calling for the Senate to subpoena four new witnesses and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) expressing reluctance to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has criticized Schumer's call for new witnesses, stating that it could set a \"nightmarish precedent\" for future impeachments. McConnell suggested that Schumer is asking the Senate to do the House Democrats' homework, implying that the House's case for impeaching Trump may be inadequate.\n\nThe call for new witnesses and additional time before the trial has been interpreted as a sign of Democrats' fear that the House's case for impeachment may fail or be laughed out of the Senate. The Democratic Party has staked its reputation on the impeachment and removal of Trump for allegedly imperiling national security, but some question whether the party's actions reflect the severity of the situation.\n\nSchumer's call for new witnesses also highlights the thinness of Article I of the impeachment, which alleges Trump's \"Abuse of Power.\" Beneath Article I, there is not a single crime listed, such as treason, bribery, or extortion. This has led some to question the nature of the impeachment, as it does not align with the list of impeachable acts the Founding Fathers designated.\n\nThe Democratic House could not prove charges of Trump conspiring with Russia to steal the 2016 election, a charge that has been a central focus of the impeachment inquiry. The investigation led by former FBI Director James Comey, which was inherited by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has been criticized for its handling of the Russia investigation.\n\nRecent reports have emerged suggesting that the FBI and CIA may have manipulated the Russia investigation, potentially setting up Trump foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos to entrap him and use him as an investigative instrument against Trump. The Justice Department's Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, has found that the FISA court warrants used to justify FBI spying were the products of incompetence, mendacity, and possible criminality.\n\nU.S. Attorney John Durham is currently investigating the roots of the FBI investigation, with a focus on the involvement of U.S. and foreign intelligence in the early days of the investigation. Attorney General Bill Barr and Durham have both stated that they do not share Horowitz's view that there was no political bias at the beginning of the investigation of the Trump campaign. Durham has the power to impanel grand juries and bring criminal indictments, and his investigation is expected to continue through the spring and summer.\n\nAs the impeachment trial approaches, the media's portrayal of the Russia investigation as a \"right-wing conspiracy theory\" has been toned down, with the Horowitz report confirming what Trump supporters have been saying for years. The treatment of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor, has also been called into question, with some arguing that he was made a victim of injustice after being used as a tool in the Russia investigation.",
    " Title: A New Era of Change: The Resurgence of the Civil Rights Movement in America\n\nArticle:\n\nThe current wave of protests against racial injustice in America is sparking a new era of change, reminiscent of the generation that emerged 60 years ago to build the civil rights movement. In a poignant reflection, civil rights activist and journalist John Lewis recalls his personal experience in the fight for equality.\n\nOn July 16, 1960, Lewis and seven other friends made history by entering the whites-only Greenville Library in South Carolina, defying segregation laws. This act occurred more than five years after the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which declared the \"separate but equal\" doctrine unconstitutional. However, in Greenville, where Lewis grew up, segregation persisted.\n\nLewis's education was limited due to segregation. He could not apply to local universities like Furman, Clemson, or the University of South Carolina. Instead, he attended the University of Illinois on a football scholarship. When he returned from Christmas vacation in 1959, he was unable to use the public library to complete his assignments due to the lack of resources in the Blacks-only library.\n\nProtests were gaining momentum, with students in Nashville, Greensboro, and other cities initiating sit-ins. The July demonstration at the library marked a turning point in Lewis's life, as it did for many across the South. The protesters faced fierce resistance, with accusations of being outside agitators, socialists, or communists, and violent opposition from private vigilantes and police officers.\n\nDespite these challenges, the movement continued to grow. In 1964, the Public Accommodations Act was passed, ending segregated public facilities. In 1965, the Voting Rights Act was enacted, following the violent police riot on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Lewis began working with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965.\n\nThe dismantling of legal apartheid opened the way for a new South. Industries and modern companies like CNN moved to the region, and athletic fields became integrated. African Americans began to win elections at various levels. However, as Lewis notes, racism was not eradicated, and institutional structures that enforce racial injustice remain.\n\nNow, a new generation is rising to address these injustices. The demonstrations following George Floyd's murder have been the largest in American history, with millions participating in protests across 2,500 locations. White participation has surpassed that of the first civil rights movement. Politicians are already responding, with reforms to police practices and bans on choke holds. Mississippi legislators have voted to retire the state flag with its Confederate battle emblem.\n\nThis new generation of protest holds great promise for America. It will face resistance, not just from politicians like Donald Trump, but also from entrenched interests resistant to change. The movement is focused on reforming areas that threaten the privileged and the powerful, such as criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and basic economic and political rights.\n\nLewis concludes by emphasizing the potential impact of this movement, stating, \"Now this generation has an opportunity to make America better, and the lives and options of millions are at stake in their struggle.\" This is a time for anyone with a conscience and a pulse to join this extraordinary movement.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes End to Federal Ban on Gun Violence Research\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has outlined a comprehensive plan to reform America's gun laws, which includes a federal ban on the manufacture and sale of new assault weapons and expanded background checks on firearm purchasers. However, a less-noticed aspect of the plan is the president's attempt to end a 15-year ban on federal research into guns and violence.\n\nIn 1996, some conservative members of Congress attempted to eliminate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control due to concerns about perceived pro-gun control bias. As a result, the CDC's funding for gun research was redirected to brain-injury research, and Congress added language to the CDC appropriation stating that no funds could be used to advocate or promote gun control.\n\nThis language has been a barrier to federal research into gun violence, with some researchers stating that the CDC's website lacks specific links to information about preventing firearm-related violence. The CDC has not conducted extensive studies on the role of guns in violence, and there is little information on basic gun topics such as gun ownership rates, the correlation of gun ownership to homicide rates, and the percentage of guns used in crimes that were obtained legally.\n\nOn Wednesday, Obama vowed to end the \"freeze\" on gun-violence research. He issued a presidential memorandum directing the CDC and other US scientific agencies to conduct research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. Obama based this move on a legal analysis that the existing appropriations language does not block wide-ranging investigations. The CDC will begin by assessing existing strategies for gun violence and identifying the most pressing research questions with the greatest potential public health impact.\n\nObama also called on Congress to appropriate $10 million to the CDC for further work, including an effort to better understand the relationship between video games, media images, and violence. He also asked for an additional $20 million to expand the National Violent Death Reporting System, which collects anonymous data on the nature of firearms used in murders or suicides, to all 50 states from its current 18.\n\nThe president's call for the CDC to dive into research is a legal analysis that it is all right for them to do so under current law. It remains to be seen how eagerly the CDC will take up the banner, and whether pro-gun groups will file suit to try and stop it. As to his calls for Congress to direct more cash to this area, the success of these requests is uncertain, as it is possible that members will see this as a less controversial alternative to more sweeping measures such as the proposed assault-weapons ban, and it is also possible that the current tight fiscal environment will allow Capitol Hill to shuffle the suggestions aside.",
    " Title: Climate Activists Disrupt Annual Harvard-Yale Football Game, Call for Fossil Fuel Divestment\n\nArticle:\n\nClimate change activists disrupted the annual Harvard-Yale football game on Saturday, delaying the game for nearly an hour during halftime. The protesters, who were from both universities, unfurled banners with slogans such as \"Nobody wins. Yale and Harvard are complicit in climate injustice.\" They called on the universities to divest their multi-million dollar endowments from fossil fuel companies and companies that hold Puerto Rican debt.\n\nApproximately 150 students gathered on the 50-yard line at Yale Bowl, with loudspeaker announcements and police demanding they leave the field. As protesters clapped and chanted \"disclose, divest and reinvest,\" organizers say several hundred more fans left their seats in the stands to join in. By the time play resumed, several dozen people were issued misdemeanor summonses for disorderly conduct.\n\nHarvard senior Caleb Schwartz, one of the protest organizers who was arrested on Saturday, told NPR the mood on the field was joyful despite the possibility of arrest. \"That moment, when we saw people running onto the field, was just really incredible,\" he said. \"I saw organizers around me crying because it was such a beautiful moment.\"\n\nSchwartz says the Harvard-Yale rivalry game has been played since 1875, and organizers knew alumni from all over the world would be tuning in. \"Although it was disruptive and some people were not too happy we were on the field, it was really important because our universities are just not listening to our voices and our generation's calls for urgent climate action,\" he says.\n\nIn a statement, the student groups behind the protest, Fossil Free Yale, the Yale Endowment Justice Coalition, and Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, wrote:\n\n\"Harvard and Yale claim their goal is to create student leaders who can strive toward a more 'just, fair, and promising world' by 'improving the world today and for future generations.' Yet by continuing to invest in industries that mislead the public, smear academics, and deny reality, Harvard and Yale are complicit in tearing down that future.\"\n\nHarvard and Yale are not the first universities to face criticism over fossil fuel investments. The first campus divestment movements started at Swarthmore College in 2011. Harvard has repeatedly said it would not pursue divestment, while Yale has made some moves in recent years to consider climate change in its investment decisions.\n\nKaren N. Peart, director of University Media Relations at Yale, told NPR in a statement:\n\n\"Yale stands firmly for the right to free expression. Today, students from Harvard and Yale expressed their views and delayed the start of the second half of the football game. We stand with the Ivy League in its statement that it is regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities.\"\n\nSaturday's protest during a marquee rivalry football game attracted widespread attention, including tweets of support from several Democratic presidential candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. The protest garnered so much interest that Schwartz changed his bus ticket back to Cambridge on Saturday so he could stay and field the deluge of media inquiries. \"We will win this fight, and we will get the university to divest,\" he told NPR from his bus home. \"I truly don't think it's a question of if, it's a question of when. And the more pressure we can put on them, the sooner they will.\"",
    " Title: John Bolton's Controversial Foreign Policy Record and Potential Impact as Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2005, John Bolton, a conservative figure known for his criticism of the United Nations, was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the UN. Despite Senate Democrats' filibuster, which limited him to a recess appointment, Bolton's tenure was marked by efforts to reform the UN's Human Rights Commission.\n\nFast forward to 2018, when President Donald Trump announced his consideration of Bolton as his secretary of state. Bolton's aversion to bureaucracy and his criticism of the UN were seen as appealing qualities for the State Department. However, concerns arise from Bolton's history of advocating for counterproductive military interventions.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues in Bolton's foreign policy record is his stance on the 2003 Iraq invasion. Bolton remains firm in his belief that the decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein was correct, despite the ensuing chaos and instability in the Middle East. Similarly, in 2011, Bolton called for the assassination of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi, a move that led to the country's disintegration into anarchy and the rise of ISIS.\n\nOn Iran, Bolton has advocated for regime change and the use of conventional bombs to target Iran's nuclear program. His proposed actions would have potentially led to a power vacuum, allowing the Islamic State to gain a foothold and disrupting the anti-ISIS campaign in Iraq, which relies heavily on Iran-linked militias.\n\nIn 2009, Bolton suggested that Israel should use nuclear weapons against Iran's nuclear program, a statement that proved to be inaccurate, as Israel did not nuke Iran, and Iran does not currently possess nuclear weapons.\n\nBolton's stance on Syria's Bashar al-Assad is also noteworthy. In 2013, he expressed opposition to an authorization to use force against Assad, but later stated that conditions were optimal for overthrowing Assad in 2003, implying that the timing was the only issue.\n\nJohn Bolton's foreign policy record is marked by a consistent support for regime change, a lack of planning for post-intervention scenarios, and a history of controversial and often counterproductive actions. If appointed as secretary of state, his tenure could potentially lead to unintended consequences and financial burdens for the United States.",
    " Title: Obamacare's Impact on Labor Force and Medicaid Prioritization\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a report stating that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is estimated to reduce the labor supply by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers. This reduction is a significant increase from the previously estimated 800,000 in 2019.\n\nThe report suggests that Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid eligibility may decrease incentives to work. This implies that the health care law may be giving low-income Americans fewer reasons to work, potentially impacting their ability to find and pursue jobs that could transform their lives and those around them.\n\nThe report also highlights a concern regarding the prioritization of coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities. In 2012, over half a million seniors and people with disabilities on state Medicaid lists were awaiting access to home and community-based services. These services could help keep individuals with disabilities out of institutions, which are often more costly.\n\nUnder Obamacare, states receive a greater federal Medicaid match to cover previously ineligible low-income individuals. The Urban Institute estimates that nearly five in six adults to be covered under the Medicaid expansion are adults without children, most in their prime working years. This suggests that Obamacare's incentive structure places a greater emphasis on expanding coverage to these able-bodied adults, who could potentially be working or preparing for work, than helping the individuals with disabilities that Medicaid was initially created to serve.\n\nThis discrepancy in prioritization has raised concerns about the compassionate nature of the health care law, with critics arguing that it may increase inequality rather than decrease it. The report concludes that the president's health care law may be discouraging Americans from working, and it questions the priority given to expanding Medicaid coverage to working-age adults over providing care to those with disabilities who are waiting for services.",
    " Title: Democrats Launch Campaign to Shame Republicans Over Expired Unemployment Benefits\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the final payments from the expired unemployment benefits program are distributed, Democrats have initiated a campaign aimed at shaming Republicans, particularly those in leadership and in swing districts, for allowing the program to lapse during the holiday season.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California stated, \"I don't know if our colleagues who have opposed passing the unemployment-insurance legislation know or care about the impact on families. The impact is very, very strong. It hurts the dignity of a family, of a worker.\"\n\nA liberal group, Americans United for Change, is running an advertisement on cable television stations. The advertisement states, \"You know who had a Merry Christmas? The richest 1 percent, that's who. Republicans in Congress made sure of that, protecting billions in taxpayer giveaways.\" It continues, \"For those facing tough times? Republicans stripped 1.3 million Americans of jobless benefits\u2014folks who want to work, but can't find a job\u2014kicking them to the curb during Christmas.\"\n\nRepublican aides have stated they remain willing to negotiate. Michael Steel, a spokesman for John A. Boehner of Ohio, the speaker of the House, asked, \"Why didn't they offer a plan that met the speaker's requirements\u2014fiscally responsible, with something to create jobs\u2014or any plan, for that matter, before they left for the holidays?\"\n\nSome Democrats have suggested continuing the program for three months, with the estimated $6 billion in spending offsets coming from agricultural subsidies in the farm bill.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky stated on Fox News, \"I support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they're paid for. If you extend it beyond that, you do a disservice to these workers. When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you're causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy.\"\n\nThe loss of benefits is expected to drain billions in consumer spending from the economy next year. People losing their federal benefits\u2014often benefits they expected to continue to receive for weeks or months into 2014\u2014have described cutting back on Christmas, driving less, turning off the heat, draining retirement accounts, applying for food stamps, readying to move in with relatives, and missing mortgage payments.",
    " Title: California Imposes Historic Water Cutbacks on Senior Water Rights Holders in Drought-Stricken Northern Region\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's water authorities have implemented significant water cutbacks for farmers in Northern California, a historic move that challenges the perception that the agriculture industry is receiving preferential treatment during the state's ongoing drought. The cutbacks affect farmers who hold some of the oldest water rights, dating back over a century, for the first time in four decades. These farmers will no longer be permitted to draw water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River, and the delta where the two rivers meet.\n\nState officials stated that the rivers do not have sufficient water to cater to all rights holders due to the current drought conditions. This is not the first time during the drought that the state has restricted water supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already curtailed nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of which are junior water rights established post-1914.\n\nFor the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is informing senior water rights holders, who established their claims before 1914, that there is not enough water for them. The recent cutbacks affect rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914.\n\nFurther historic cuts could be implemented over the summer, as the State Water Resources Control Board continues to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state. The water board warned that cutbacks could be imminent for even more senior rights holders in various watersheds.\n\nState officials stated that the water rights being curtailed amount to 1.2 million acre-feet, but it is unclear whether the cutbacks will save that exact amount. The water board has hinted in recent months that curtailments for senior rights holders were coming, leading some farmers to store extra water in preparation.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Executive Order to Streamline Infrastructure Project Environmental Reviews\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order aimed at streamlining the environmental review and permitting process for major infrastructure projects in the United States. The order, titled \"Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects,\" is designed to make the process more efficient and effective.\n\nThe current system for completing environmental reviews has been criticized as fragmented, inefficient, and unpredictable. The Federal Government lacks a system for tracking the costs of the environmental review and permitting process for major infrastructure projects. The Executive Order requires agencies to track these costs.\n\nAccording to a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, it takes an average of 7 years for a complex highway project to go through the entire environmental review process. The National Association of Environmental Professionals reports that a single agency can take 3.7 to 5 years on average to complete an environmental review. One study has found that the average delay of six years for major infrastructure projects costs the U.S. economy trillions.\n\nThe new Executive Order implements a One Federal Decision policy under which the lead Federal agency will work with other relevant Federal agencies to complete the environmental reviews and permitting decisions needed for major infrastructure projects. Each agency will sign a joint Record of Decision and all required Federal permits will be issued 90 days later. The order establishes a two-year goal to process environmental documents for major infrastructure projects.\n\nThe entire environmental review and permitting process will be reviewed to improve performance across the government, and every agency will be held accountable. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) will develop and implement an action plan to improve environmental reviews Government-wide. The CEQ will mediate disagreements between Federal agencies to prevent delays due to bureaucratic disputes.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will develop a two-year Government-wide modernization goal and ensure Federal agencies take meaningful steps to achieve it. Agencies will modify their strategic plans to include agency-specific goals for improving environmental review and permitting processes, and hold their officials accountable. OMB will establish a performance accountability system and score each agency on their implementation of the Executive Order. Poor performance will be considered in budget formulation and could result in the imposition of available penalties.\n\nAgencies will also be held accountable for implementing appropriate best practices that are proven to enhance the environmental review and permitting process. The Executive Order makes clear that environmental protections will be maintained, and that the process should focus more on decision-making and good environmental outcomes rather than bureaucratic process.\n\nPresident Trump has made infrastructure a priority and has taken action to rebuild America. This Executive Order is part of his ongoing efforts to modernize the nation's infrastructure.",
    " Title: Democratic-aligned Groups Form Alliances to Counter Republican Financial Advantage in 2012 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 general election, Democratic-aligned super PACs and advocacy groups are collaborating to support President Barack Obama and selected House and Senate candidates. This joint effort aims to counter the significant financial resources of Republican groups, which are expected to spend up to $1 billion on their air war.\n\nFrom newly formed super PACs to unions, environmentalists, and women's groups, Democratic-aligned organizations are forming temporary partnerships to achieve their immediate goals, whether it's supporting a specific candidate or targeting a shared Republican adversary.\n\nCooperation between outside groups on both sides has occurred in past cycles, but operatives involved in the 2012 efforts claim a new level of intensity and urgency this time around, as liberal advocacy groups strive to protect their interests against a potential $1 billion Republican onslaught.\n\nBill Burton, the former White House spokesman now helping guide the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action, stated, \"The partnerships are a critical part of our strategy here. We have no doubt that the Koch brothers and Karl Rove are going to have more dollars than us. We knew we could leverage every dollar we have three or four times if we team up.\"\n\nWhile campaigns cannot coordinate with independent spending groups, there are no rules preventing cooperation between the myriad interest groups on the right and left, which often share the same political objectives and compete for the same funds. For Democrats, fundraising has been particularly challenging this cycle.\n\nTwo recent examples of this collaboration emerged this week, as Priorities USA Action and the labor giant SEIU jointly committed $4 million to Spanish-language television ads criticizing Mitt Romney as hostile to working people. Meanwhile, a coalition of five environmental groups is preparing to launch an almost two-month campaign to boost Democratic Rep. Martin Heinrich in the New Mexico Senate race. The organizations involved\u2014the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund\u2014are splitting the cost evenly, according to a strategist familiar with the campaign.\n\nEMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock stated that Democratic organizations have coordinated for years, often through the coalition-building group America Votes, but that teamwork is closer than ever this cycle. In addition to Priorities USA Action, Democrats have established super PACs to focus on both chambers of Congress: Majority PAC, which focuses on the Senate, and House Majority PAC. Key collaborators include SEIU, EMILY's List, LCV, and the public-sector labor group AFSCME.\n\nSchriock explained, \"Because resources are tight and we're up against just an avalanche on the Republican side, we knew right away that none of us had resources that we could waste, nor could we in any way duplicate efforts at all.\" She added that EMILY's List would \"move money into whatever vehicle\" appears most effective in a given race. Her group partnered earlier this year with VoteVets.org and Majority PAC to run TV commercials for Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\nFor the groups that are joining forces\u2014sometimes for a single ad campaign, sometimes over a longer period of time\u2014there may be a limit on the total size of the financial pie available. As of now, there are no Koch or Sheldon Adelson-level benefactors on the Democratic side\u2014that is, ideological billionaires willing to pour potentially unlimited funds into their chosen causes.",
    " Title: Surge Pricing During Seattle Shooting Sparks Outrage Among Riders, Companies Cap Prices\n\nArticle:\n\nA deadly shooting that erupted in downtown Seattle on Wednesday, resulting in a woman's death and seven injuries, led to a surge in pricing from ride-hailing services Lyft and Uber, causing outrage among some riders. The surge pricing, which typically ranges from $20 to $30, quadrupled as people attempted to escape the chaotic scene.\n\nRiders took to social media to express their displeasure, with some posting images of their inflated charges. Heather Szum tweeted a $122 charge for a ride to West Seattle, stating, \"Lovely @lyft. So much for getting away from an active shooter while the buses are delayed/shutdown.\" Another rider, Lisa Wilkins, posted an image of a charge exceeding $126. A Twitter user under the handle pulkit2911 noted his usual $25 to $35 ride from Seattle to Bellevue skyrocketed to $149.23, writing, \"Shame on you lyft.\"\n\nSpokespersons for both Uber and Lyft stated that surge pricing was capped when it automatically engaged in response to increased demand. They also mentioned that both companies have begun refunding affected customers.\n\nThe shooting occurred at approximately 5 p.m. on Pine Street between Third and Fourth avenues, with authorities responding to bullets fired. One woman was killed, and seven men, including a 9-year-old boy, were wounded. The surviving victims were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and the city's medical examiner's office was set to release the identity of the deceased woman.\n\nA 21-year-old man, Jamel Jackson, who was among the wounded, was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm. Authorities are still searching for two more suspects, identified as William Ray Toliver and Marquise Tolbert, aged 24.\n\nPhotos released by Seattle police show William Ray Tolliver and Marquise Tolbert, the two individuals authorities are seeking in connection with the shootout. A handout image taken by Nikesh Parekh and posted on his Twitter account shows police activity at the scene of the deadly shooting in downtown Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe shooting scene was at the same intersection that houses BlueShift, an Amazon office building, where two company employees were among the wounded. Both employees were standing outside when the gunfire erupted, according to KCPQ-TV.\n\nAn investigation of the chaotic event forced authorities to shut down several streets. While people complained about the surge in pricing on social media, others also noted when the pricing was capped.\n\nUber's website includes a page entitled 'Looking out for the Uber Community During an Emergency,' written by the company's global head of physical security. The page notes that Uber has a 'Global Security Center' that monitors and flags 'issues that may affect our business and the communities in which we operate\u201424 hours a day, 7 days a week.' Pricing is capped when a'major emergency event may have occurred.'\n\nLyft issued a statement to DailyMail.com, calling the shooting 'tragic.' \"Our thoughts are with the victims and their families,\" the company said.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Accuses Benghazi Committee of Being Political Hit Job Aimed at Her\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has denounced the House Select Committee on Benghazi, citing controversial remarks by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that she claims prove the panel is a political hit job aimed solely at her. Clinton, who is scheduled to testify before the committee later this month, stopped short of calling for the committee's shutdown, stating that is up to Congress.\n\nClinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, made her comments at a forum in New Hampshire hosted by NBC's \"Today.\" She said, \"Now that they have admitted that it is a political partisan committee for the sole purpose of going after me, not trying to make our diplomats who serve in dangerous areas safer, that's up to the Congress.\"\n\nThe Republican-led committee has been investigating the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The Clinton email scandal, in which she used a private email account to conduct official business as secretary of state, has become a key issue probed by the committee.\n\nLast week, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made remarks that the committee's work was responsible for Clinton's declining poll numbers in the presidential contest. In response, Clinton said, \"This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans. I would never have done that.\"\n\nProviding a glimpse of her upcoming testimony, Clinton touted her close relationship with Stevens and said that she would never have used the deaths of Americans to go after her political foes. \"I would never have done that,\" said an indignant Clinton. \"Look at the situation they chose to exploit to go after me for political reasons: The death of four Americans in Benghazi. I knew the ambassador. I identified [his body]. I asked him to go there. I asked the president to nominate him.\"\n\nClinton expressed eagerness to testify and answer questions on her own terms, provided the committee has not been shut down before her scheduled appearance on Oct. 22. \"I'll be there, and I'm looking forward to answering questions about real things when I'm there, and I'm looking forward to having a chance to explain everything we've done, everything I asked to happen,\" she said. \"But it is not appropriate what they have done from obviously their own admission.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Establish Constitutional Right for Same-sex Marriage, but Consequences Remain Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday did not establish a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, but instead declined an opportunity to rule definitively on the question. However, the legal landscape is shifting in favor of same-sex couples seeking to marry, with the consequences of the court's decision likely to be significant.\n\nFive states that previously banned same-sex marriage had their state-enacted bans wiped off the books as a result of the Supreme Court's decision. Couples in these states, often referred to as \"The Five,\" could begin marrying regardless of gender as of today, with some obtaining licenses immediately.\n\nIn six other states that had banned same-sex marriage, further legal proceedings may be necessary to apply the rulings of the relevant federal circuit courts of appeal. However, as these six states are connected to The Five through the federal circuit system, the same judgment will apply. The implementation of this judgment in these six states is already in motion.\n\nThis development brings the number of states where gay marriage has been legalized, either by the state itself or through federal cases, to 30. These states are home to the vast majority of the national population.\n\nThere are still opportunities for the Supreme Court to reassert itself in this debate, but the question is whether they choose to do so. Many legal experts have observed a trend in the federal system and a signal from the nine justices who sit at the court's zenith.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to decline review came after it decided Windsor v. United States in June 2013, which struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This decision opened the door for other challenges to state laws barring gay marriage or treating gays differently.\n\nNow, as these challenges come in waves, the federal courts at all levels are applying the reasoning from Windsor with great consistency. If the high court wanted to use that as an occasion to declare a constitutional right, it could have taken one or more of the cases it declined today. However, opponents of gay marriage had hoped the court would take such a case to uphold the states' right to ban gay marriage.\n\nInstead, Amy Howe, the editor of the highly regarded SCOTUSBlog, observed that the justices instructed their confreres at lower levels of the pyramid to \"keep on doing what you're doing.\" In other words, there is not a clear majority of the nine justices to settle the matter with a landmark ruling one way or the other.\n\nThe Supreme Court could choose to re-enter the fray at some later point, perhaps when another circuit court of appeals weighs in with a ruling that supports the state's right to ban gay marriage. This would at least create a conflict for the Supreme Court to resolve. Or it could revisit the issue later, perhaps when a clear majority has formed either to prohibit gay marriage or to permit it. This might require waiting until Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on such issues, declares himself, or until the next retirement of a sitting justice and the confirmation of a successor.\n\nHowever, as the number of legal gay marriages skyrockets, and the practice becomes both legal and common across most of the states and most of the population, a future court is less and less likely to rescind it.",
    " Title: Trump Issues Executive Orders to Streamline Federal Employee Dismissal Process\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued three executive orders on Friday, aimed at reducing the time it takes to dismiss federal employees. According to multiple reports, the changes are expected to save taxpayers $100 million per year.\n\nThe orders, announced by White House officials in a call with reporters, will instruct those in charge of federal agencies to prioritize performance over seniority. This move is likely to cause concern among federal employees, as public sector unions traditionally oppose merit-based rules for advancement.\n\nUnion officials and experts have labeled the move as an attempt to decrease the power of federal employees' unions, which protect federal workers from unfair terminations and employment practices. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union representing 700,000 government workers, issued a statement calling the move an \"assault on public servants.\"\n\nThe phrase \"public servant\" has been criticized in the past for its connotation that government employees are serving the public, rather than being employed by the public. The notion that employees should not be dismissed for poor performance is a contentious issue, particularly when taxpayers are footing the bill.\n\nPublic sector unions are often powerful, especially in deep blue states, making it difficult to dismiss employees for offenses. In 2018, the Los Angeles Unified School District paid off a teacher who was found to have been feeding semen to his students rather than firing him.\n\nPresident Trump's focus on results, rather than maintaining the opposition's support, is a departure from many modern Republican politicians. This approach may be seen as a scorched-earth strategy by some, but it could potentially prove to be a successful re-election strategy.",
    " Title: House Passes Short-Term Spending Bill, Sending It to Senate for Further Amendments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term spending bill on Tuesday, funding domestic programs through March 23, while providing the Department of Defense with a full-year budget of $659 billion. The measure, which passed in a 245-to-182 vote, now moves to the Senate, where Democrats are expected to amend the legislation and send it back to the House for another round of voting.\n\nThe bill provides a $52 billion funding boost for the Department of Defense over 2017 levels, but it maintains flat funding for most other government programs for another six weeks. House Republicans argue that the spending bill offers much-needed certainty to U.S. military planners who have expressed frustration with Congress' inability to pass a long-term spending bill.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, claim that the GOP proposal is an attempt to slash funding for education, infrastructure, and other domestic priorities. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi stated during Tuesday's debate, \"Instead of working constructively with Democrats to meet the needs of the American people, Republicans are trying to starve the domestic budget.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced on Tuesday that they were working on a deal that would lift the tight budget caps that limit how much Congress can provide for defense and non-defense domestic programs alike. The budget caps were set in 2011 as part of an effort to reduce the deficit, but lawmakers have never adhered to those spending limits.\n\nIf congressional leaders reach a broad budget deal, it would allow lawmakers to write a long-term government spending bill and potentially end the fiscal brinksmanship that has led to the passage of one short-term funding bill after another. The federal government is currently operating on its fourth short-term funding bill for the fiscal year that began on October 1, 2017, and it is set to expire at midnight on Thursday. If lawmakers do not reach an agreement before then, it would trigger another partial government shutdown, following last month's three-day closure.\n\nThe House-passed bill is likely to be changed in the Senate, where Democrats have vowed to block any spending bill that short-shifts funding for domestic spending. It remains unclear if Senate Democrats will move to strip out the extra defense funding, or if they will attach other provisions to address their concerns.\n\nIn the House, Democrats also want to address the status of DREAMers, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. President Trump plans to end an Obama-era program that shields those immigrants from deportation next month, leaving them in limbo. He has challenged Congress to come up with a legislative solution for immigration and stated on Tuesday, \"I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this taken care of.\"\n\nWith the House set to recess for their annual retreat on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Democratic caucus stated that lawmakers would hold their meetings at the Capitol instead \"given the pressing issues Congress will likely vote on over the next three days.\"",
    " Title: Student Loan Interest Rates Set to Double as Congress Fails to Reach Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nInterest rates on Stafford student loans, the most popular funding source for college students, are set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1, 2013, as lawmakers failed to find a bipartisan solution to keep the federally subsidized borrowing costs low. The Senate adjourned Thursday night for the July 4 recess without approving a student loan rate package.\n\nWithout new legislation, either to extend the current cap, set a new one, or find another way to peg the loans, the interest rate increase will take effect. The higher rates will add approximately $3,000 to the total interest on a $23,000 student loan repaid over 10 years, according to estimates.\n\nDemocrats have sought to keep interest on Stafford loans low, arguing that poor and middle-class students need financial assistance to obtain college educations. Republicans, aiming to cut or control spending, have proposed linking student loans to the financial markets instead of letting Congress set federal lending rates. President Obama included a market-based approach in the budget he sent to Congress earlier this year, sparking opposition from his fellow Democrats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's spokesman, Don Stewart, expressed hope that President Obama would be able to persuade Democrats to join a bipartisan effort to assist students. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, however, has stated that tying rates to the 10-year treasury note yield could never pass and that he cannot back a plan without stronger protections for students and parents.\n\nDemocrats plan to vote on a one-year extension of the current interest rates on July 10. However, once rates rise, some experts fear generating votes to rein them back in could prove difficult. \"The sense of urgency could be lost, and that means interest rates will [stay] higher,\" said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council of Education.\n\nUndergraduates currently pay 3.4 percent or 6.8 percent, depending on their loan structures, while graduate students and parents borrow from the government at 7.9 percent interest under the current system. Few students are expected to sign loan documents in July, with many students finalizing aid packages closer to returning to campus in the fall.\n\n\"Federal loans are still one of the best options,\" Hartle said. \"But we could see students that are a little pinched by these rates.\"",
    " Title: GOP Leaders Admit to Artificially Fabricated Fiscal Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, House Speaker John Boehner and Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan have admitted on national television that the fiscal cliffs, sequestrations, and budget battles they have created are not the result of an imminent debt crisis but rather artificially fabricated by ideologues and self-interested politicians.\n\nDuring yesterday's edition of ABC's \"This Week\" and CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" both Boehner and Ryan acknowledged that the United States does not have an immediate debt crisis. This admission aligns with President Obama's previous acknowledgment of the same reality.\n\nThe significance of this admission goes beyond the politics of a Republican House speaker agreeing with a Democratic president. It reveals a larger truth: the GOP's fiscal alarmism is not a natural reaction to reality but a calculated means to achieve ideological ends.\n\nBoehner's and Obama's statements are factually correct. As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman has pointed out, federal debt as a share of GDP will be substantially less than it was at the end of World War II and will also be substantially less than debt in several European countries in the mid- to late 1990s. It is also lower than the 80 percent of GDP level that many economists say starts to put countries in a precarious position.\n\nThe long-term debt outlook is only dire because the projections assume without question that \"future Congresses will enact huge new deficit-increasing tax cuts and spending hikes.\" As Krugman writes, \"We \u2019re looking at debt levels that a number of advanced countries, the US included, have had in the past, and dealt with.\"\n\nGiven this reality, it is crucial to address the long-term debt in a pragmatic and sober manner, but not to pretend it is an imminent crisis worthy of draconian austerity measures. Pragmatic solutions include phasing out the Bush tax cuts, reducing defense and war spending, moving toward a single-payer healthcare system, and spending more on social programs that fight economic inequality.\n\nHowever, the national conversation about the budget is dominated by debt demagogues with ulterior motives. These alarmists create the perception of an immediate crisis to manufacture opportunities to legislate their otherwise politically impossible agenda items, such as Social Security and Medicare cuts, social program cuts, and other shock doctrine prescriptions.\n\nBoehner, Ryan, and other prominent political voices have ignored more prudent ways forward, instead claiming that these shock doctrine prescriptions are required immediately due to the supposed urgency of the debt crisis. By using the supposed urgency as a rationale to create fiscal cliffs, sequestration battles, and debt ceiling crises, they have sought to scare America into abruptly accepting the kind of draconian policies that polls show the public opposes.\n\nWith Boehner and Ryan's recent admissions, the charade's most sacred lie has been exposed. In acknowledging that \"we do not have an immediate debt crisis,\" GOP leaders are admitting that there is, in fact, an alternative. They are also admitting that their longtime claims to the contrary were ends-justify-the-means tactics to manufacture an unnecessary panic.\n\nWith the truth out in the open, perhaps a more reasoned debate can begin, and more pragmatic policies can finally take center stage.",
    " Title: Second Presidential Debate Predictions: A Tie Likely Due to Changed Expectations and Improved Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming second presidential debate on Tuesday is expected to result in a draw, according to political analyst J.T. Young. This assessment should not dishearten Republicans, as it does not imply that Mitt Romney will not perform well again. Instead, it signifies that the landscape has shifted due to the impact of the first debate, with factors now in play that are largely beyond Romney's control.\n\nThe first debate saw Romney benefit from unrealistically low expectations, a result of President Barack Obama's campaign strategy of personal diminution and the media's readiness to echo it. This advantage is no longer present. Similarly, the high expectations previously held for Obama have been lowered, as it is now clear that he is not the Democratic Demosthenes advertised.\n\nExpectations play a significant role in politics, especially in debates. There are no objective standards for determining a clear winner or loser. The outcome is subjective, measured against the expectations brought to the debates.\n\nRomney's first debate victory was largely due to his performance exceeding the public's pre-debate expectations, while Obama fell significantly below them. The difference was substantial, leading to an undisputed victory for Romney. However, the outcome of the second debate will be less clear, as expectations are now more realistic.\n\nRomney will find it challenging to improve upon his first debate performance. He did all the right things the first time, but replicating the same performance will not be easy. On the other hand, Obama is expected to improve his performance. The Democrats, as demonstrated by Vice President Joe Biden in the vice presidential debate, are determined to be more engaged and passionate this time, appealing to Obama's base.\n\nThe Democratic base will not repeat their mistake of the first debate, where they were disengaged and dispassionate. After the first debate, they, along with the media, expressed their disappointment. This time, they will not let their guard down, ensuring there will not be a clear-cut consensus as to who won the debate.\n\nThe second debate's likely tie verdict in the media does not mean Romney should not prepare or try to win. Instead, it suggests that Romney has already established his credibility in the first debate, making himself appear at least the equal to Obama in the eyes of much of the broader public. This time, he does not have to extend himself to do so; he just has to be himself.\n\nThe president, however, has to extend himself in this debate, carrying a greater need and risk. The risk is evident, as demonstrated during the vice presidential debate. The final reason for the likely tie verdict is that Romney does not have to win; he has already achieved that in the first debate. The president, on the other hand, has to prove himself anew.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the second presidential debate is likely to be judged a tie in the media. However, Romney supporters should not be dismayed, as a tie likely means that their candidate has been a victim of his own success.",
    " Title: Black Women's Health Challenges: A Historical and Contemporary Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nBlack women face significant health challenges compared to other racial groups, with elevated rates of chronic cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic risk factors. This is evident despite controlling for factors such as smoking, physical exercise, and dietary variables. Black women have the highest body mass index (BMI) in the U.S., with four out of five classified as either \"overweight\" or \"obese.\"\n\nHistorically, this heightened concern about their weight can be traced back nearly three centuries, reflecting the racist stigmatization of black women's bodies. In the late 19th century, medical practitioners often attributed black women's health issues to their presumed inability to control their \"animal appetites\" - eating, drinking, and fornicating. These assumptions were not based on scientific data but embodied the prevailing racial scientific logic at the time.\n\nToday, the idea that weight is the main problem for black women perpetuates these historically racist ideas and ignores how interrelated social factors impact black women's health. Social determinants, such as workplace discrimination, poor service at restaurants, and online harassment, contribute to higher rates of chronic mental and physical illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety.\n\nStudies show that the stigma associated with body weight, rather than the body weight itself, is responsible for some adverse health consequences blamed on obesity, including increased mortality risk. Regardless of income, black women consistently experience weightism in addition to sexism and racism.\n\nLiving in racially segregated, high-poverty areas also contributes to disease risk for black women. These neighborhoods often lack potable water, have higher levels of environmental toxins and air pollution, and are disproportionately impacted by a lack of grocery stores offering more nutritious food choices. Food insecurity, which is defined as the lack of access to safe, affordable, and nutritious foods, has a strong association with chronic illness independent of BMI.\n\nLabeling chronic diseases like diabetes or heart conditions as \"lifestyle\" diseases, when behaviors are not the central problem, is misleading. Difficult life circumstances cause disease. In other words, the predominant reason black women get sick is not because they eat the wrong things but because their lives are often stressful and their neighborhoods are often polluted.\n\nThe most effective and ethical approaches for improving health should aim to change the conditions of black women's lives, tackling racism, sexism, and weightism, and providing opportunities for individuals to thrive.",
    " Title: Taliban Agrees to Temporary Ceasefire in Afghanistan, Paving Way for U.S.-Taliban Peace Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Taliban's ruling council has agreed to a temporary ceasefire in Afghanistan, providing a potential window for a peace agreement with the United States. The ceasefire, which was demanded by Washington before any peace agreement could be signed, would allow the U.S. to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, ending its 18-year military engagement, the longest in U.S. history.\n\nThe U.S. wants any deal to include a promise from the Taliban that Afghanistan will not be used as a base by terrorist groups. The U.S. currently has an estimated 12,000 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban chief must approve the ceasefire decision, but this is expected. The duration of the ceasefire was not specified, and it was not specified when the ceasefire would begin. Four members of the Taliban negotiating team met for a week with the ruling council before they agreed on the brief ceasefire.\n\nTalks were suspended in September when both sides seemed on the verge of signing a peace pact. However, a surge in violence in the capital Kabul killed a U.S. soldier, prompting President Donald Trump to declare the deal \"dead.\" Talks resumed after Trump made a surprise visit to Afghanistan at the end of November, announcing the Taliban were ready to talk and agree to a reduction in violence.\n\nA key pillar of the agreement, which the U.S. and Taliban have been hammering out for over a year, is direct negotiations between Afghans on both sides of the conflict. Those intra-Afghan talks were expected to be held within two weeks of the signing of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal. They will decide what a post-war Afghanistan will look like.\n\nThe first item on the agenda is expected to address how to implement a ceasefire between the Taliban and Afghanistan's National Security Forces. The negotiations, however, were expected to be prickly and will cover a variety of thorny issues, including rights of women, free speech, and changes to the country's constitution.\n\nThe intra-Afghan talks would also lay out the fate of tens of thousands of Taliban fighters and the heavily armed militias belonging to Afghanistan's warlords. Those warlords have amassed wealth and power since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by the U.S.-led coalition. They were removed after Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. The Taliban had harbored bin Laden, although there was no indication they were aware of al-Qaida's plans to attack the United States.\n\nEven as the Taliban were talking about ceasing hostilities, insurgents carried out an attack in northern Afghanistan on Sunday that killed at least 17 local militiamen. The attack apparently targeted a local militia commander who escaped unharmed. Local Afghan militias commonly operate in remote areas, and are under the command of either the defense or interior ministries.\n\nLast week, a U.S. soldier was killed in combat in the northern Kunduz province. The Taliban claimed they were behind a fatal roadside bombing that targeted American and Afghan forces in Kunduz. The U.S. military said the soldier was not killed in an IED attack but died seizing a Taliban weapons cache.\n\nThe U.S. military, in its daily report of military activity, said airstrikes overnight Sunday killed 13 Taliban in attacks throughout the country. Taliban as well as Afghan National Security Forces aided by U.S. air power have carried out daily attacks against each other. The Taliban frequently target Afghan and U.S. forces, as well as government officials. However, scores of Afghan civilians are also killed in the crossfire or by roadside bombs planted by militants. The United Nations has called on all sides in the conflict to reduce civilian casualties. The world body said increased U.S. airstrikes and ground operations by Afghan National Security Forces, as well as relentless Taliban attacks, have contributed to an increase in civilian casualties.",
    " Title: U.S. Officials Overestimate Number of Americans Fighting for ISIS, Says Analyst\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent Pew Research poll found that two-thirds of Americans consider the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) a \"major threat\" to the United States. However, a closer look at the numbers of Americans fighting for ISIS suggests that such fears may be overblown.\n\nU.S. officials have been inflating the numbers of Americans fighting for ISIS, according to analyst Peter Bergen. For instance, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated earlier this month that \"We are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL forces.\" However, the Pentagon later corrected Hagel's statement, clarifying that the 100 count is the total number of Americans fighting for any of the various groups fighting in Syria, some of which are allied with the U.S.\n\nMatthew Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, also confirmed that 100 is the total count of the various Americans fighting in Syria and not a count of those fighting for ISIS. Hagel's statement is just the latest in a series of inflated claims regarding the number of Americans fighting with ISIS. Last week, the Washington Times cited anonymous official sources who said there are 300 Americans fighting with ISIS, despite the Pentagon estimating the figure to be more like a dozen.\n\nThe case of Somalia offers a cautionary tale. The last sizeable group of Americans who went overseas to fight with an al Qaeda-aligned group are the 29 Americans known to have traveled to fight with the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab after the 2006 invasion of Somalia by the Ethiopian army. However, none of those 29 subsequently planned or conducted a terrorist attack inside the United States, according to a survey of more than 240 jihadist terrorism cases since September 11 conducted by the New America Foundation.\n\nIndeed, for more than a third of the American militants who fought with Al-Shabaab, going to Somalia was a one-way ticket. In 2008, a missile strike in Somalia killed Ruben Shumpert, a resident of Seattle. A year later, Burhan Hassan, a 17-year-old from Minneapolis, was killed in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Abdirizak Bihi, Hassan's uncle, reportedly said at the time, \"We believe he was killed because he would have been a key person in the investigation into the recruitment (of young Somali men) here in Minneapolis.\"\n\nAl-Shabaab militants also are said to have killed Alabama native Omar Hammami, who joined the group in 2006 and took a high-profile position in its media operations before his death last year. At least two Americans fighting for Al-Shabaab died while conducting suicide attacks in Somalia.\n\nShirwa Ahmed, a 26-year-old from Minnesota, became the first known American to conduct a suicide bombing for an al Qaeda-associated group when he drove a car packed with bombs into a government compound on October 28, 2008. In 2011, the FBI confirmed that Farah Mohamed Beledi, a 27-year-old Minnesota man who was born in Somalia and moved to the United States at age 12, was killed while attempting to detonate a suicide bomb in Somalia.\n\nIn addition to the American militants who died in Somalia, six were arrested, four when they returned to the West and two in East Africa. Kamal Said Hassan, a 28-year-old Minneapolis man who traveled to Somalia and attended an Al-Shabaab training camp before returning to the United States, was arrested and in 2009 pleaded guilty to supporting Al-Shabaab. In another case, Mahamud Said Omar, an American resident who helped organize Al-Shabaab's recruitment pipeline and visited a training camp, was arrested in the Netherlands in 2009. Omar was extradited to the United States and in 2012 was convicted on terrorism charges.\n\nOf course, the fact that 13 of the 29 American militants who fought in Somalia remain at large is a reminder that the CIA and FBI also need to pay attention to the potential threat posed by American foreign fighters in Syria. But this is no reason for U.S. officials to overhype the threat posed by ISIS to the United States. Yes, Americans should always be mindful of the threats posed by extremists. But as the case of U.S. citizens in Somalia suggests, Syria could very well end up being a graveyard for Americans fighting there rather than a launch pad for attacks on the United States.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Loss: An Examination of the Role of Sexism in the 2016 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 United States Presidential Election saw the defeat of Hillary Clinton by Donald Trump, and the subsequent days following the election witnessed a wave of accusations of sexism as a contributing factor to Clinton's loss.\n\nOn social media, under the top-trending hashtag #NotMyPresident, many Americans expressed their belief that misogyny played a significant role in Clinton's electoral failure. MSNBC's Jonathan Alter wrote on election night, \"Trump didn't win because of Comey, he won because he's a testosterone candidate and men weren't ready for a woman president.\"\n\nVice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine, introducing Clinton before her concession speech, acknowledged the historical significance of Clinton's campaign, stating, \"Hillary Clinton has made history in a nation that is good at so many things, but has made it uniquely difficult for a woman to be elected.\"\n\nCharlotte Alter, writing at Time, argued that Clinton's loss \"may be as good a sign as any that we're not ready for glass-breaking yet.\" She described the \"stench of sexism\" that allegedly magnified Clinton's flaws and minimized her considerable strengths throughout her campaign.\n\nHowever, the Clinton campaign itself played up the \"glass ceiling\" narrative, with Clinton dispensing \"woman cards\" to supporters and carefully choosing the Javits Center for her election night speech to symbolize her breaking the glass ceiling.\n\nDespite these claims, the article suggests that sexism may not have been the primary cause of Clinton's loss. The article cites numerous reasons for Clinton's defeat, including obvious corruption, lockstep leftism, disastrous health-care prescriptions, abortion fanaticism, and basic incompetence.\n\nThe article concludes by referencing a viral video of Clinton expressing frustration over her electoral position, which some compared to a famous scene from the movie Office Space. The article suggests that the accusations of sexism may have contributed to the backlash that led to the election of Donald Trump.\n\nIn conclusion, while sexism undeniably exists, the article argues that attributing Clinton's loss to sexism is an oversimplification of the complex factors that led to her defeat in the 2016 Presidential Election.",
    " Title: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price Assures No Financial Harm from Obamacare Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, stated that no American will be financially worse off after the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He emphasized that individuals would have the freedom to choose the coverage they desire for themselves and their families, rather than being compelled to buy a specific plan.\n\nThe American Health Care Act, the Republican plan to replace Obamacare, was unveiled last week. However, the proposal has faced opposition from a mix of moderate and far-right lawmakers, as well as conservative groups. The plan, which has been marked up and advanced through key committees, aims to have the replacement signed into law before Congress recesses for Easter.\n\nIn the interview, Price criticized Obamacare as a system that benefits the government and insurance companies, rather than the American people. He expressed a desire for a system that caters to the needs of the people.\n\n\"We need a system that works for people,\" Price added, stating that he and President Trump believe that a system that is accessible to all and financially feasible for everyone will lead to increased coverage, as opposed to the current trend of people losing coverage and fewer individuals being covered than before."
