    " Title: U.S. Economy Experiences Strongest Quarterly Growth Since 2003\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy has shown significant growth, with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) soaring 5% on an annual basis in the third quarter, as reported by the government on Tuesday. This marks the strongest quarter of growth since 2003. According to Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, \"there's no doubt the economy has been great this year.\"\n\nThe robust growth was observed across various sectors, including business investment, consumer spending, housing, exports, and government spending. Consumer spending, in particular, increased to a healthy pace of 3.2%, compared with previous estimates for 2.2%. With gas prices remaining low, many expect this trend to continue through the holiday season.\n\nDefense spending was a significant contributor to the third quarter's growth, surging 16%. This growth represents an upgrade from the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 3.9% growth, making it the third and final reading on GDP for the year. The stellar third-quarter growth also marks an acceleration from the very strong growth of 4.6% during the second quarter and the rough first quarter when GDP was -2.1% due to harsh winter weather.\n\nThe strong growth has led to a significant increase in hiring, with employers adding 321,000 jobs in November. This makes 2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999. The solid growth could clear the path for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in 2015.\n\nThe American public seems to be taking notice of the positive economic headlines, as more than half of Americans now think the economy is in good shape, according to a new CNN/ORC poll released on Tuesday. This marks a significant improvement from October when just 38% of Americans said economic conditions were somewhat or very good.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that new data released on Tuesday showed that orders of big-ticket items unexpectedly declined in November, suggesting businesses are hitting the brakes on investment. As a result, another quarter of 5% growth may not be expected to wrap up 2014.",
    " Title: Gun-Rights Activists File Federal Lawsuit to Block Maryland's New Assault Weapons Law\n\nArticle:\n\nGun-rights activists in Maryland have initiated a federal lawsuit to prevent the enforcement of the state's new gun law, which includes restrictions on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, before it takes effect on October 1. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Maryland.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the Second Amendment and case law protect their right to own assault rifles and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The Baltimore Sun reported that the plaintiffs include the Maryland Licensed Firearms Dealers Association, the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore, and several other organizations, individuals, and gun shops.\n\nThe new Maryland law, passed earlier this year, bans 45 types of assault weapons, but allows those who currently own them to keep them. The law also limits handgun magazines to 10 rounds and requires people to submit fingerprints to the state police to obtain a license to buy a handgun.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs plan to ask a judge Friday for an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect, according to a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association. A spokeswoman for Governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, expects the law to withstand the group's legal challenge.\n\nJohn Josselyn, Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore's legislative vice president, said in a statement that the restrictions are \"an unconstitutional violation\" of the Second Amendment rights of \"law-abiding, responsible citizens.\"\n\n\"Together we are drawing a line in the sand where Maryland's gun control agenda tramples the fundamental individual right to defend oneself and family in the home,\" Josselyn said.\n\nA spokesman for the Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore Inc., one of the plaintiffs, said the new laws would keep honest citizens from being able to \"choose effective firearms for defense in the home.\"\n\nThe pending new law has led to a significant increase in applications for firearm purchases, resulting in a backlog. In the last two weeks, state troopers said applications are coming in at the rate of 1,000 per day.\n\nMaryland State Police said Tuesday that residents who have submitted handgun purchase applications before new requirements go into effect next week will not have to obtain a handgun qualification license. The agency said that troopers will not enforce the new requirements, which also include background checks and fingerprinting, on applications submitted by September 30.\n\nAs of Friday, slightly more than half of the more than 100,000 purchase applications received had been processed, according to the agency. The agency began 24/7 operations in December to process the applications, but the backlog continued to grow.\n\nEarlier this month, state police said 20 law enforcement officers from other agencies began helping with background investigations. State law requires that the investigations be conducted by police officers.\n\nTroopers also said that beginning last week, 24 data entry employees from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services have been inputting information from applications. State police said several security measures were being taken to limit the access of DPSCS employees to the State Police database.",
    " Title: FBI Interrogates Las Vegas Shooting Suspect's Girlfriend, No New Information on Motive\n\n Article:\n\n The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was questioned by the FBI on Wednesday. Marilou Danley, who is regarded by investigators as a \"person of interest,\" stated through her lawyer that she had no idea the shooter, Stephen Paddock, was planning violence.\n\n Danley, 62, said in a written statement read to reporters by her attorney in Los Angeles that Paddock never said anything to her or took any action that she understood to be a warning of the impending violence. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters he found it hard to believe that Paddock could have assembled the arsenal of weapons, ammunition, and explosives recovered by police completely on his own.\n\n Nearly 500 people were injured when Paddock, 64, opened fire on an outdoor concert from his 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip on Sunday night. He took his own life before police stormed his room, bringing the total death toll to 59. Police recovered nearly 50 firearms from three locations they searched, nearly half of them from the hotel suite. Twelve of the rifles there were fitted with so-called bump stocks, officials said, allowing the guns to be fired almost as though they were automatic weapons.\n\n In response to a question, Lombardo said investigators were examining the possibility Paddock's purchase of more than 30 guns in October 2016 may have been precipitated by some triggering event in his life. If Paddock did have any accomplice, there remained no evidence as yet \"to indicate terrorism\" in the shooting spree, said Aaron Rouse, FBI special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office.\n\n Earlier in the day, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas, marking the first time since taking office that he has had to confront a major mass shooting. In her statement after being questioned in Los Angeles, Paddock's girlfriend Danley insisted she knew Paddock as \"a kind, caring, quiet man.\" Danley, an Australian citizen of Filipino heritage, said she flew back to the United States voluntarily \"because I know that the FBI and Las Vegas Police Department wanted to talk to me, and I wanted to talk to them.\"\n\n Danley, who was twice married before her relationship with Paddock, became a focus of the investigation for having shared his retirement community condo in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas, before leaving the United States for the Philippines in mid-September. FBI agents met her plane at Los Angeles International Airport before interviewing her, two U.S. officials briefed on the case told Reuters. As of midday Wednesday, there was no indication she was aware of Paddock's plans, they said.\n\n Investigators questioned her about Paddock's weapons purchases, a $100,000 wire transfer to a Philippine bank that appeared to be intended for her, and whether she saw any changes in his behavior before she left the United States. \"Assuming she had no role in his actions, the most important thing is any light she can shed on Paddock's motive,\" said one official, who spoke about the investigation on condition of anonymity.\n\n Danley said Paddock had bought her an airline ticket to visit her family and wired her money to purchase property there, leading her to worry he might be planning to break up with her. Paddock's brother Eric told reporters the $100,000 transfer was evidence that \"Steve took care of the people he loved,\" and that he likely wanted to protect Danley by sending her overseas before the attack.\n\n She arrived in Manila on Sept. 15, flew to Hong Kong on Sept. 22, returned to Manila on Sept. 25 and was there until she flew to Los Angeles on Tuesday night, according to a Philippine immigration official. Discerning Paddock's motive has proven especially baffling given the absence of the indicators typical in other mass shootings. He had no criminal record, no known history of mental illness, and no outward signs of social disaffection, political discontent, or extremist ideology, police said.\n\n Trump, touring a hospital in Las Vegas, told reporters Paddock was \"very demented,\" and he asked Lombardo if investigators were any closer to establishing a motive. \"We've had a couple good leads and we're working our way through it,\" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told the president.",
    " Title: Biden Campaign Outraises Trump's in Second Consecutive Month\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development four months before the upcoming presidential election, the campaigns of President Donald Trump and his challenger, Joe Biden, have announced their fundraising totals. The Biden campaign has surpassed Trump's fundraising efforts, marking an unusual occurrence for a challenger to outraise an incumbent president.\n\nTrump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee announced on Wednesday evening that they had raised $266 million for the three months ending June 30, including $131 million in June alone. In contrast, Biden's campaign and the Democratic National Committee announced they had raised $282 million during the last quarter and $141 million in June.\n\nJen O'Malley Dillon, Biden's campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters, \"It's clear that voters are looking for steady leadership, experience, empathy, compassion, and character\u2014and they'll find all of these qualities in Vice President Joe Biden.\"\n\nWhile Biden has conducted frequent fundraisers with high-dollar donors, his campaign emphasized its success in growing its list of small donors, with the average online donation last month being $34. The Trump campaign is boasting its substantial cash-on-hand war chest, now totaling $295 million, largely due to the early start Trump's campaign and fundraising efforts received upon his inauguration.\n\nThe Biden campaign has not disclosed its current funds, with full numbers to be available no later than July 20. The Trump campaign's focus on ad spending appears to be on holding onto states won in 2016, including some that were previously considered safe for the president. The Trump campaign has reserved nearly $100 million worth of ad time this fall in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and is also buying ads in Georgia, Michigan, and Iowa, states Trump won in 2016.\n\nThe Biden campaign's fundraising surge coincides with national and state polls showing the president lagging behind Biden, partly due to the Trump administration's response to the pandemic and protests against racial injustice. The most recent Electoral College battleground analysis from NPR shows neither candidate currently has the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, but Biden is closer with at least one state Trump previously won\u2014Michigan\u2014leaning his way, while the president has failed to make progress in states that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in 2016.",
    " Title: House Speaker Pelosi Announces Delay of Impeachment Vote, Citing Constitutional Duty\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced Tuesday evening that the lower chamber would not be taking a formal vote on whether to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump at this time. In a meeting with the House Democratic caucus, Pelosi stated, \"We're not here to call bluffs \u2014 we're here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious.\"\n\nAccording to Fox News, congressional aides privy to the closed-door discussions reported that Democrats do not wish to appear to be complying with the Trump administration's demands, following the White House's refusal last week to cooperate with the ongoing impeachment probe due to the lack of a floor vote authorizing the proceedings.\n\nIn an 8-page letter to Pelosi and other top Democrats, Counsel to the President Pat Cipollone wrote, \"In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized House Democrats for abandoning due process in a speech from the Senate floor earlier in the day. McConnell stated, \"House Democrats are finally indulging in their three-year-old impeachment obsession, full steam ahead.\" He went on to remind his colleagues that some Democrats had declared their plans to impeach President Trump before he was even inaugurated.\n\nMcConnell continued, \"I don't think many of us were expecting to witness a clinic in terms of fairness or due process, but even by their own partisan standards, House Democrats have already found new ways to lower the bar.\" He added, \"For all the public hyperventilating over institutional norms that we've heard from House Democrats, it appears they have no intention of letting norms, precedents or basic due process stand in the way as they seek to cancel out a presidency.\"",
    " Title: China's November Exports and Imports Show Slower Global and Domestic Demand\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's November exports grew at a slower pace than expected, with a 5.4% increase year-on-year, according to Chinese customs data released on Saturday. This marks the weakest performance since a 3% contraction in March and is significantly below the 10% forecast in a Reuters poll. The slowdown in exports is attributed to the fading impact of firms rushing out shipments to beat planned U.S. tariff hikes and cooling global demand.\n\nChina's exports to major partners showed significant annual growth slowdowns. Exports to the United States rose 9.8% in November, compared with 13.2% in October, while exports to the European Union increased by 6.0%, down from 14.6% in October. Exports to South Korea fell year-on-year, contrasting with a 7.7% rise in October.\n\nImport growth was 3%, the slowest since October 2016, and significantly below the 14.5% seen in the poll. Imports of iron ore fell for a second time, reflecting waning restocking demand at steel-mills as profit margins narrow.\n\nWang Jun, chief economist of Zhongyuan Bank in Beijing, commented, \"The sluggishness in imports and exports is in full swing.\" He added that the soft imports \"show a relatively significant pullback in domestic demand.\"\n\nIn recent months, Chinese exports had expanded robustly, which economists attributed to front-loading of cargoes before a now-postponed plan to hike U.S. tariffs of $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% on Jan. 1. The November trade numbers came out less than a week after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce, delaying that tariff hike as they negotiate a trade deal.\n\nStirring fears of a reignition of trade tension, the daughter of Huawei Technologies' founder, a top executive at the Chinese technology giant, was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 and faces extradition to the United States, threatening to drive a wedge between the U.S. and China.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, on Friday, sounded an optimistic note about trade negotiations with China as his top economic advisers downplayed friction from the arrest of Meng Wanzhou. \"China talks are going very well,\" Trump said on Twitter, without providing any details.\n\nAnalysts at Haitong Securities in Shanghai noted, \"Growth in shipments of Chinese goods on U.S. 200 billion tariff list has started to pull back, indicating that frontloading effects may be starting to recede.\" They added, \"Now with U.S. and China agreeing not to escalate trade tensions any longer, China will start purchasing U.S. agricultural goods, which may narrow China-U.S. trade surplus in the future.\"\n\nChina's November trade surplus with the United States was a record $35.55 billion. The October surplus was $31.78 billion. But China's imports from the U.S. in November fell 25% from a year earlier, while the annual decline in October was only 1.8%. For trade with all countries, China's surplus was $44.74 billion for November, compared with forecasts of $34 billion and October's surplus of $34.02 billion.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. reported that its global trade deficit in October jumped to a 10-year high, and that the deficit with China surged 7.1% to a record $43.1 billion.\n\nEconomists say one factor helping keep up Chinese exports this year is that the yuan has weakened more than 5% against the dollar, helping to make Chinese products more competitive abroad. Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office of brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai, said the weaker yuan \"should boost industrial exports over the coming months.\"\n\nEconomists in recent months have penciled in a deterioration in China's export outlook in 2019, factoring in higher U.S. tariffs on a wider range of Chinese goods. Chinese policymakers are expected to offer more policy support and deliver more support measures if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate.\n\nChina's central bank has cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves four times this year, as policymakers seek to steady the slowing economy amid the trade war with the United States. The government aims for growth of around 6.5% this year, compared with 2017's 6.9% pace. Yang Yewei, an analyst at Southwest Securities in Beijing, said that as global demand cools, \"domestic growth-boosting measures should be more effective.\"",
    " Title: Constitutional Moment: Trump's Actions and the Erosion of the Rule of Law\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of lectures and publications, Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman has proposed a theory of constitutional change known as \"constitutional moments.\" This theory suggests that constitutions can be altered not only through the formal amendment process but also when prominent political actors act contrary to the existing constitution, and their actions are accepted and validated by the people, thereby establishing a new constitutional norm.\n\nThe current political climate in the United States is characterized by some as a constitutional moment in Ackerman's sense. In an op-ed titled \"Trump's firing of Comey is a crisis of American rule of law,\" Harvard Law School constitutional law professor Noah Feldman argues that President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey represents a blow to the unwritten constitutional norm of political neutrality.\n\nFeldman contends that while Trump's actions were technically within his constitutional rights, they violate an unwritten norm that has developed under the living constitution, which emphasizes the independence of law enforcement and political neutrality. This norm may be becoming more important than the traditional power of democratically elected politicians to supervise and fire officials in the executive branch.\n\nThe development of this norm has led to the emergence of a powerful \"administrative state\" in Washington, consisting of career bureaucrats who see themselves as above politics and believe they are running the country. Temporary political appointees who offend these careerists do so at their peril, as evidenced by the forced resignation of former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt due to a series of ethical lapses leaked by career staff who did not approve of his policies.\n\nThe current constitutional moment raises questions about who is truly running the country: the elected president or the career bureaucracy. This question was addressed by former FBI Director James Comey in his testimony to Congress following his firing, in which he stated that while the president may have the constitutional right to fire him for any reason, doing so for an inappropriate reason could be considered an impeachable offense.\n\nThe development of this new constitutional order, in which career bureaucrats wield significant power and influence, has been compared to systems such as the European Union and the United Kingdom, in which the career experts in the European Commission and the people's representatives in Parliament and the Council have gradually been consigned to rubber-stamping the laws they propose.\n\nAs the Trump administration continues, the power dynamics between the elected president and the career bureaucracy will likely remain a topic of debate and discussion. Early in this administration, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich predicted that President Trump would put up with the career bureaucracy telling him what he could and could not do for only about 60 days, after which he would \"break this town.\" Whether Trump will \"break\" the system or be \"broken\" remains to be seen.",
    " Title: San Bernardino Considering Legalization of Medical Marijuana for Revenue and Regulation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe bankrupt California city of San Bernardino, known for its historical significance as the site of the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, is exploring the possibility of legalizing medical marijuana and taxing its sale as a means of generating revenue and regulating the industry. The idea was spurred by concerns about the proliferation of illegal medical marijuana dealers in the city.\n\nCity Attorney Gary Saenz stated that a legislative review panel has been formed by the City Council to study the idea. This panel is collecting data, consulting with the city police department, and examining laws in other jurisdictions before bringing a proposal to the full committee. The panel plans on holding at least two more public meetings on the subject through August.\n\nPolice have reported as many as 20 illegal storefronts in the city at any given time, according to Saenz. Legalizing and regulating the now-unwieldy industry, he feels, is one of the tools available to the city to take control of the situation.\n\nCity Council member James Mulvihill expressed his support for the idea, citing the high cost of enforcing against illegal dealers. He stated that it costs the city $10,000 every time it goes after an illegal dealer. Any funds gleaned from the regulation and tax of marijuana dispensaries, according to Mulvihill and City Council member Michael McKinney, would be used exclusively for enforcement.\n\nMayor R. Carey Davis, according to McKinney, prefers not to see any marijuana dispensaries in the city, but is open to exploring all options to address the current problems. McKinney stated that his office has been receiving calls advocating both sides of the issue.\n\nIt is important to note that San Bernardino, with a population of 209,924, has maintained an outright ban on pot shops since medical marijuana was made legal through a ballot referendum in 1996. This was reaffirmed last year when the state Supreme Court in San Francisco unanimously ruled that local jurisdictions have authority to prohibit medical marijuana despite its legality at the state level.\n\nSan Bernardino declared bankruptcy in 2012, becoming the largest city in the U.S. to do so. Mulvihill emphasized that his support for the dispensaries is narrow, stating, \"I\u2019m doing this because of the trouble we\u2019re in -- we can\u2019t control it.\"",
    " Title: Cuba in Mourning: Life Without Fidel Castro in 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nCuba is currently observing an official period of mourning following the death of longtime dictator Fidel Castro, who passed away last Friday. NPR's Carrie Kahn is in Havana and reports that the usually bustling city is unusually quiet, with few people out in the streets and many establishments closed.\n\n\"It's quite unusual here in Havana,\" Kahn said. \"Usually on a Saturday or Sunday night, there's tons of people out in the street all along the iconic sea wall, the Malecon, listening to music, talking, drinking. There's none of that now. There's nobody out celebrating. Bars are closed. Discotheques are closed. There's no alcohol being sold in many restaurants. It's a very subdued scene here.\"\n\nFidel Castro, who officially stepped down as president in 2008, passing power to his brother Raul, remained a significant figure in Cuban life until his death. Raul Castro has been in power for at least 10 years, and while there is no expectation of significant changes in the immediate future, there is uncertainty about what the absence of Fidel means for Cuba.\n\n\"This is the first time in decades that there is Cuba without Fidel,\" Kahn said. \"He was really out of the limelight a lot, but in 2016, we heard from Fidel two times.\"\n\nThe first time was in response to President Obama's historic visit to Cuba in March, during which Fidel criticized the United States. The second time was during the Cuban Communist Party's once-every-five-years Congress, where Fidel appeared on national television, looking frail and praising communism.\n\nKahn, who has been to Cuba several times since the opening in 2014, reported that opinions about Fidel Castro vary among Cubans. Some older people expressed sadness and pain, while others were glad he was gone and hoped for more change.\n\n\"We'll just have to see if that was the truth,\" Kahn said, referring to the possibility that Fidel was the one putting the brakes on economic reforms and the opening. \"There have been few political openings, especially in the last two years. There have been more detentions and more repression of human rights activists and people fighting for open political expression here.\"\n\nKahn emphasized that the focus of the opening has been on economic, not political, changes. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Cuba without Fidel Castro.",
    " Title: French President Macron Urges U.S. to Maintain Global Engagement in Address to Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron addressed the United States Congress on Wednesday, praising the country for its global leadership and urging it to maintain an open perspective on international threats. In his speech, Macron emphasized the importance of avoiding isolationism and nationalism, which he argued would only exacerbate fears and not provide lasting solutions.\n\nDuring his three-day state visit, Macron, the first foreign leader to be granted an official state visit by the Trump administration, has enjoyed a series of pompous and cordial meetings with President Trump. However, on Wednesday, Macron showcased his independent centrist stance by addressing subjects of disagreement between the two leaders, such as isolationism and nationalism, which are key components of Trump's \"America First\" agenda.\n\nMacron urged the U.S. not to \"close the door to the world,\" stating that isolationism and nationalism are temporary answers that would only inflame, rather than alleviate, the fears of its citizens. His speech was met with a three-minute standing ovation and was described as an uplifting, emotional, and history-laden tribute to the \"miracle relationship\" shared between the U.S. and France.\n\nSince Monday, Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have been feted by the Trump administration with the first state dinner, a tour of monuments, and a review of U.S. troops. The visit has been marked by a growing chemistry between the two leaders as they consider pressing global threats, including Russian aggression, the Syrian civil war, climate change, North Korea, and the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, this chemistry seemed to produce a diplomatic breakthrough for the Iran deal, with Macron moving closer to Trump's harsh critique of the agreement. On Wednesday, Macron seemed to backtrack from Tuesday's harder line, stating that the deal should not be abandoned before \"something more substantial\" is developed.\n\nMacron also prodded the Trump Administration on the Paris climate agreement, which Trump canceled U.S. involvement in at the start of his presidency. Macron expressed confidence that the U.S. will rejoin the accord.\n\nIn discussing climate change policy, Macron made a direct reference to Trump's 2016 campaign pledge \"Make America Great Again\" by stating, \"Let us work together in order to make our planet great again and create new jobs and new opportunities while safeguarding our earth.\"\n\nOn terrorism, the French leader noted shared efforts to combat extremism and lamented the multiple attacks in the U.S. and Europe over the past five years, which he called a \"horrific price to pay for freedom and democracy.\"\n\nMacron also took direct aim at the scourge of \"fake news,\" warning that lies disseminated online threaten freedoms worldwide. \"Without reason, without truth, there is no real democracy,\" he said, adding that \"the corruption of information is an attempt to erode the very spirit of our democracies.\"\n\nAn hour before the address, Trump tweeted, \"Busy day planned. Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today. This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done...he will be GREAT!\" The speech coincided with the 58th anniversary of a Washington address to Congress by then-French President Charles de Gaulle.",
    " Title: U.S. Policy Shifts and Their Potential Implications for the Middle East\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent comments of Omid Memarian, a human rights expert at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, suggest that Iranian leaders fear a resurgence of the Green Movement, a political movement that emerged following the disputed presidential election in 2009. Memarian's observation is that the Iranian authorities' harsh treatment of human rights lawyers is indicative of their fear of exposure and a desire to evade accountability.\n\nHowever, the task of supporting the Green Movement, as was done for Solidarity in Poland during the Reagan administration, has become more challenging due to President Trump's indifference towards human rights issues and his policies towards migrants. The potential strategic repercussions of this shift in American values are being observed in the Middle East.\n\nThe article also suggests that the Trump administration's policies could mark the end of the American era in the Middle East. Trump's willingness to support Saudi Arabia, even in the face of human rights abuses, and his desire to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan, could benefit Iran in both cases. The article also notes Trump's reluctance to re-establish deterrence with Tehran through a limited military response and his general skepticism regarding America's role in policing the global commons.\n\nThe article further discusses the potential consequences of these policies for traditional U.S. allies in the Middle East. It is noted that Saudi Arabia, despite its large military budget, is unable to defend itself and may be undefended if the U.S. does not provide protection. The article also points out the potential for Iran to take advantage of this situation, given the large and unhappy Shiite minority in eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe article concludes by suggesting that the U.S.'s response to an unprovoked attack on a central pillar of the global economy is a test of American leadership. The consequences of failure will be felt for years, and this should be a concern for the new National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien.",
    " Title: Obama and Congressional Republicans Differ in Lessons from Fiscal Cliff Deal as Budget Deadlines Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama and congressional Republicans have drawn contrasting lessons from the deal to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" as they prepare for negotiations on a series of budget deadlines that carry risks such as crippling defense cuts and a government default.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Obama emphasized the deal set a precedent for agreements on deficit reduction and federal spending, requiring wealthier individuals or corporations to pay more taxes. He stated, \"The deficit needs to be reduced in a way that\u2019s balanced,\" and \"Everyone pays their fair share.\"\n\nHowever, many Republicans argued that the agreement this week gave Mr. Obama all the tax increases he would ever get, and future deals must focus on spending cuts. Some Republicans, such as Sen. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, suggested they might force a government shutdown to make their point in negotiations over raising the nation's borrowing limit, a measure the president said he no longer debates.\n\nBoth sides will have the opportunity to test their principles soon. The bill approved by the House on Tuesday postpones steep, automatic spending cuts until March 1, giving the White House and Congress less than two months to agree on an alternative solution to reduce deficits. This fiscal deadline will be followed by another on March 31, when temporary legislation to keep the government running is set to expire.\n\nLooming over both of these cutoff dates is the even more contentious question of raising the nation's debt ceiling of $16.4 trillion. The government technically has already reached its borrowing limit, but the Treasury Department is taking steps to postpone the day of reckoning until late February or early March. After that, the government would start defaulting on its debts, a scenario that Mr. Obama described as reckless.\n\n\"If Congress refuses to give the United States government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic\u2014far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff,\" the president said late Tuesday at the White House.\n\nMr. Obama stated his protracted feud with Republican leaders over raising the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011 hurt the economy. \"The last time this course of action was threatened, our entire recovery was put at risk,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Consumer confidence plunged. Business investment plunged. Growth dropped. We can\u2019t go down that path again.\"\n\nThe president stated he \"will not have another debate with this Congress\" over raising the debt limit, but it's hard to see how he can avoid it if Republicans want to use the issue as leverage to achieve spending cuts.\n\nAs for the president's argument for more revenue, Republicans argued this week's agreement ended the question of taxes. Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, stated, \"We can and will pursue comprehensive tax reform this year, in 2013, and next steps. We need to address the fundamental driver of our deficits and debt, and that is out-of-control spending.\"\n\nBoth sides dispute just how much the fiscal cliff bill accomplishes. While the president is hailing it as a deficit-reduction measure, the agreement would boost the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, when compared with a scenario in which Congress did nothing. Democrats argued the legislation will lower deficits by about $600 billion over 10 years compared with current policy, because doing nothing was never a realistic option. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated the bill will increase spending over the next decade by about $330 billion.",

    " Title: USWNT Lawsuit: A Timeline of the Gender Discrimination Case Against U.S. Soccer Federation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) is currently engaged in a gender-discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was filed in March 2019. The lawsuit gained international attention following the team's dominant victory in the 2019 Women's World Cup, with the crowd chanting \"Equal Pay!\" as the U.S. team celebrated their fourth World Cup victory on July 7, 2019.\n\nHere is a timeline of the current lawsuit, according to reporting by ESPN:\n\n* March 2019: The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\n* July 2019: USSF president Carlos Cordeiro released an open letter, citing what he described as extensive analysis of 10 years of financial data. He said the data showed that from 2010 to 2018, the women's players were paid $34.1 million in salary and game bonuses by U.S. Soccer, compared to $26.4 million given to the men during the same time period. The men's and women's teams operate with separate collective bargaining agreements and pay structures.\n* Nov 2019: federal judge R. Gary Klausner of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the USWNT's motion to give its lawsuit class certification. The early win for the women meant the lawsuit could include players who appeared for the national team dating back to Feb. 4, 2015. U.S. Soccer had opposed the motion for certification.\n* Feb 2020: In February, the two sides filed very different motions in district court. Lawyers for the USWNT filed for partial summary judgment seeking back pay of at least $66.7 million in addition to punitive damages. USSF asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit \"based on the actual facts in the record and the governing law.\"\n* March 2020: The federation reversed course on the most contentious of its arguments. Cordeiro resigned on March 12 amid backlash from fans and sponsors to language in court filings attempting to show women's players did not perform work of equal skill, effort, and responsibility. Both Cordeiro and new USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone apologized for the language widely viewed as demeaning women's players and women's sports generally.\n* May 2020: The trial was originally slated to begin on May 5 but was pushed back to June 16 after both sides sought guidance from the court in light of the coronavirus outbreak. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has issued a stay-at-home order in his state because of the global pandemic. U.S. Soccer publicly apologized for and legally walked back its most hard-line arguments. Indeed, it earned a fairly resounding win on the motion for summary judgment by focusing not on the idea that the women's players did not perform equal work but that the differences in CBAs did not constitute discrimination but fair trade-offs willingly negotiated.\n\nThe USWNT alleges that the federation engages in \"institutionalized gender discrimination.\" The trial is set to begin on June 16, 2020. The outcome of the trial will determine whether the USWNT has experienced gender-based pay discrimination.",
    " Title: North Carolina's 9th Congressional District: State Board of Elections Orders New Election Due to Absentee Ballot Fraud\n\nArticle:\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections unanimously voted on Thursday to order a new election for the 9th Congressional District, following months of investigation into an absentee ballot scheme linked to the campaign of Republican Mark Harris. The decision comes after the board found evidence of illegal activity that \"tainted the results of the entire election.\"\n\nThe results of the November 6th election, which showed Harris leading Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes, have been in limbo due to fraud allegations. The 9th Congressional District seat has remained vacant in the new Congress as a result. The district spans the area between Charlotte and Fayetteville.\n\nThe board was tasked with reviewing the evidence and deciding whether to certify the November 6th results or order a new election in the district. Before the vote, Chairman Bob Cordle stated that the \"illegal activity\" uncovered had \"tainted the results of the entire election.\"\n\nRepublican Mark Harris initially fought to have his November 6th win certified, including mounting a court challenge. However, he abruptly reversed course at Thursday's hearing, stating that he struggled with recall and confusion during the hearing due to a severe infection and two strokes he suffered last month.\n\nAfter spending three hours on the stand, Mr. Harris returned from an extended lunch break and announced his change of heart. He also revealed that he was hospitalized last month with a severe infection and suffered two strokes.\n\nMr. Harris maintained that neither he nor leaders of his campaign knew about the scheme to \"harvest\" absentee ballots, which is illegal in North Carolina. The scheme was allegedly orchestrated by political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, who refused to testify at the hearings.\n\nThe North Carolina Republican Party Chairman, Robin Hayes, stated that he respected Mr. Harris' decision. North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin, on the other hand, attributed the wrongdoing to Mr. Harris and the Republican Party.\n\nKristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, cheered the decision for the new election. She stated that the evidence of rampant absentee ballot fraud made clear that the outcome of the election was completely illegitimate.\n\nThe board will set the date of the election at a future meeting. Earlier, Mr. Harris testified that Mr. Dowless had assured him they were not breaking the law. However, documents and testimony presented by election officials indicated otherwise, including cases of collecting absentee ballots and filling in ballots for some voters. It is illegal in North Carolina for anyone other than a voter or a close relative to mail in an absentee ballot.",
    " Title: Defense Teams for Sen. Menendez and Salomon Melgen Accuse Justice Department of Mischaracterizing Evidence in Bribery and Fraud Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent court filing, lawyers for Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and his wealthy donor, Salomon Melgen, have accused the Justice Department of having a \"fixation on sex and salacious headlines\" and have reiterated their call for a court to dismiss bribery and fraud charges against them. The defense teams took aim at a contention by prosecutors and FBI agents that they had uncovered some \"corroboration\" for claims the men may have consorted with prostitutes at luxury homes in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that no witness or document, throughout the entire investigation, has ever accused Senator Menendez of being in the presence of a prostitute, much less engaged in relations with one. They also disputed the FBI's characterization of a black notebook found at Melgen's office as a \"prostitution ledger.\" Melgen's lawyers claim the notebook was filled with innocent material, and the FBI mistook jottings about \"Dixi\" to mean a prostitute, when it was instead the name of a sanitation company in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe court filings by the defense team foreshadow what could be a heated argument next week in a federal courthouse in New Jersey. Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have accused the government of \"serious misconduct,\" including media leaks, a preoccupation with the defendants' sex lives, and misstating facts to the grand jury that indicted the men.\n\nLast month, public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department said it was the defendants who were twisting the facts. Lawyer Peter Koski said authorities had conducted \"an exhaustive, focused, and disciplined investigation\" that produced a 22-count criminal indictment against the long-serving senator from New Jersey and his wealthy friend of about two decades. The indictment said Melgen paid for travel and housing for Menendez in exchange for a series of favors from the lawmaker.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Walls has already refused defense requests to move the trial out of New Jersey. On Sept. 17, he will hear both sides argue a series of incendiary motions about critical pieces of evidence and the way authorities gathered information and presented it to grand jurors. The case is scheduled for trial in November, but either side may seek to appeal, perhaps delaying the trial into an election year. Once Walls rules on a critical issue in the case\u2014whether Menendez is charged with crimes, in part, for actions he took in the course of his public service, protected under the Constitution's \"speech or debate clause\"\u2014the trial will proceed.\n\nRandall Eliason, a former prosecutor who now teaches at George Washington Law School, said in a blog post this week the case is \"shaping up as a clash that will have all the quiet gentility of a New Jersey mob war.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Proposes $2 Trillion Infrastructure Bill as Fourth Phase of Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called for a $2 trillion infrastructure bill as the fourth phase of the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The proposal was made via a tweet on Tuesday, just days after Congress approved a massive stimulus package worth over $2.2 trillion.\n\nIn his tweet, Trump stated, \"With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades-long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4.\"\n\nTrump has long sought a major infrastructure bill, and this proposal appears to be a renewed pitch as an economic stimulus measure. The president's tweet comes as lawmakers in both the House and the Senate are already considering a fourth coronavirus response bill, although some have expressed caution about continuing to appropriate such large sums of money.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently stated, \"I think the odds are we'll need more legislation. First, we don't know the extent of the crisis in terms of the magnitude, so that could rise. But there are going to be problems that we don't realize now that we'll have to grapple with.\" Schumer's comments were reported by The Hill.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) also expressed the need for further legislation, telling CNN that Democrats \"had bigger direct payments in our bill, and we think we'll get more direct payments in another bill.\"\n\nIn a fourth stimulus package, Democrats are reportedly seeking additional funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, as well as emissions restrictions on airlines\u2014a measure that was blocked from inclusion in the package passed last week. Pelosi also plans to push for pension protections, which did not make it into phase three of the stimulus package.\n\nHowever, Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), have expressed a desire to see the impact of the first three phases of coronavirus response legislation before considering another bill.\n\nThe 880-page coronavirus stimulus package, worth $2.2 trillion and passed and signed into law by Trump last Friday, is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. The bill provides massive aid to individuals, large corporations, and small businesses, with its unanimous passage in the Senate despite concerns on both sides about whether it involves too much spending or not enough.\n\nThe package includes provisions to help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months initially proposed. Furloughed workers would receive whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600-per-week add-on. The package also provides $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has stated that he would be willing to ask Congress for more money for small businesses and those in the private workforce should it be necessary. A key piece of the latest relief bill is $350 billion in funding for small businesses, with businesses with fewer than 500 employees eligible for up to $10 million in loans, which can be used for payroll and other expenses, like insurance premiums, mortgages, rent, or utilities.\n\nThe latest unemployment numbers, released last Thursday, revealed that Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged to 3.28 million as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses around the country to close. The Labor Department said Thursday that the new number eclipsed the previous record of 695,000, which was set in 1982, and is well above the levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIt is unclear, at this point, what provisions the White House would like to see as part of any proposed infrastructure legislation. As of Tuesday morning, the U.S. reported over 164,700 positive cases of COVID-19 and over 3,170 deaths.",
    " Title: Trump Officially Announces 2020 Presidential Campaign, Faces Double-Digit Polling Deficit\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 President Donald Trump has officially entered the 2020 presidential race with an event in Orlando, Florida. However, recent polling indicates that he has a significant lead to make up, as former Vice President Joe Biden currently holds a 10-point advantage over the president.\n\nAt an event in Washington, DC on Monday, Biden stated, \"I believe we can win Texas and Florida if you look at the polling data now.\" According to a new CBS battleground poll of early contest states, Biden holds a double-digit lead against his many Democrat primary opponents, with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris taking the other top spots.\n\nBiden also expressed his plans to campaign in the South, stating, \"I plan on campaigning in the South, and if I'm your nominee, winning Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, believe it or not.\"\n\nCNN reports that the Trump campaign severed ties with several pollsters last week after information of unfavorable internal polls leaked to the press. President Trump denies the existence of the leaked polls, insisting they are \"phony\" and that \"I'm actually a very honest guy.\"\n\nThe polls in question showed the president trailing Biden by double digits in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and by seven points in Florida, where Trump is officially announcing his re-election campaign on Tuesday. Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale dismissed the polls as \"ancient,\" adding that the campaign has seen \"huge swings in the president's favor\" since March.\n\nHowever, even a Fox News poll Sunday showed Trump trailing behind five Democrat candidates in hypothetical matchups. Political reporter Julia Manchester from The Hill pointed out that \"These are national polls, and I think one big lesson we've learned from 2016 is that national polls do not tell the whole story all the time.\"\n\nPresident Trump maintained to ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he has a plan to win swing voters. \"Safety, security, great economy,\" said Trump. \"Frankly, I think we're going to do tremendously now with African Americans, with Asians, with Hispanics because they have the lowest unemployment numbers they've ever had in the history of the country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other 2020 Democrat contenders are also campaigning and making efforts to engage with voters. For instance, Mayor Pete Buttigieg claims, \"We are working hard to engage people across the party but especially black voters. We have a moment on our hands where we can do the exact opposite of what the president has done. The president has used identity as a wedge, he's used race as a wedge to divide people who have common interests.\"\n\nFor now, the 2020 Democrat contenders appear united in going after President Trump instead of each other. This could quickly change, however, as they start facing off in debates next week.",
    " Title: Germanwings Co-Pilot Allegedly Intentionally Crashed Plane, Says French Prosecutor\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference today, Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, stated that the co-pilot of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps this week appeared to have intentionally destroyed the aircraft. Robin confirmed reports about the pilot being heard on the voice recorder asking co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, a German citizen, to take over the controls, with a chair heard moving and a door heard closing.\n\nThe co-pilot, 27, took control, Robin said, and the accelerated descent was made manually. The motivation behind Lubitz's actions remains unclear. Germanwings, which owns the aircraft, initially disputed the prosecutor's comments but later accepted the crash was intentional. Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, stated, \"We have to accept that the plane was crashed on purpose.\"\n\nSpohr added that the co-pilot, who had 630 hours of flying time, had undergone extensive psychological and aviation review since beginning training in 2008 and joining the company as a first officer in 2013, though his training was interrupted six years ago for an unspecified reason.\n\nThe initial 20 minutes of the flight were reported to be normal, with the pilots communicating in a \"jovial\" manner. However, later, the captain can be heard on the voice recording knocking on the door and asking to re-enter the cockpit, but there was no response from the co-pilot. The co-pilot can be heard breathing until the moment of impact, leading officials to believe he was alive until the crash.\n\nAir traffic control can also be heard calling, with no response from the cockpit. Lubitz, who lived in Montabaur, Germany, had no reason to lock the pilot out of the cabin, no reason not to respond to air traffic control, and no reason to disable the plane's ability to maintain contact with other planes in the area, Robin said.\n\nToward the end of the descent, investigators can hear \"violent\" banging on the door as the pilot tries to get in, Robin added. Lufthansa CEO Spohr stated that pilots are able to enter a code to re-enter the cockpit, but the pilot inside is able to disable the system electronically. So either the captain did not enter the code or Lubitz blocked his entry, he said.\n\nSpohr added, however, \"We have total confidence in our pilots and co-pilots.\" The German Interior Ministry stated there is no evidence that Lubitz had a connection to terror. The ministry is also working closely with the Dusseldorf prosecutor, who has launched an investigation into the matter. Real-time updates on this developing story are available through the \u2588\u2588\u2588 phone app.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Issue Rulings on Travel Ban, Union Fees, and California Abortion Clinic Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court is set to issue rulings this week on several significant cases, including the legality of President Donald Trump's travel ban on people from five Muslim-majority nations entering the country. The nine justices are also due to decide on the legality of California regulations on clinics that steer women with unplanned pregnancies away from abortion and the issue of non-union workers paying fees to unions representing certain public-sector workers.\n\nThe travel ban case was argued on April 25, with the court's conservative majority signaling support for Trump's policy in a significant test of presidential powers. The justices began their term in October and aim to make all their rulings by the end of June, with more due on Monday. Six cases remain to be decided.\n\nThe current travel ban, announced in September, prohibits entry into the United States by most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. The challengers, led by the state of Hawaii, have argued the policy was motivated by Trump's enmity toward Muslims. Lower courts have decided the ban violated federal immigration law and the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the government favoring one religion over another.\n\nIn a significant case for organized labor, the court's conservatives indicated opposition during arguments on February 26 to so-called agency fees that some states require non-members to pay to public-sector unions. Workers who decide not to join unions representing certain state and local employees must pay the fees in two dozen states in lieu of union dues to help cover the cost of non-political activities such as collective bargaining. The fees provide millions of dollars annually to these unions.\n\nThe justices seemed sceptical during March 20 arguments toward California's law requiring Christian-based anti-abortion centers, known as crisis pregnancy centers, to post notices about the availability of state-subsidized abortions and birth control. The justices indicated that they would strike down at least part of the regulations.",
    " Title: Romney Speaks at NAACP Amidst Controversial Voter ID Law and Election Context\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faced a challenging scenario on Wednesday as he delivered a speech at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The speech's backdrop was heightened by the previous day's address by Attorney General Eric Holder, who criticized a proposed Texas voter ID law as harmful to minority voters and drew parallels to segregationist policies and practices.\n\nHolder's speech in Houston framed the 2012 presidential election's political landscape for Republicans, emphasizing the sensitive and potentially explosive nature of attempting to unseat the nation's first African-American president. Romney, who has avoided in-depth discussions on race, was expected to present his economic case to the NAACP, an organization known for its historical role in civil rights advocacy.\n\nTara Wall, a senior communications adviser to Romney, acknowledged the challenges of reaching out to black voters and building coalitions. She emphasized the importance of addressing the jobs and unemployment situation, holding the administration accountable for the current economic state, and presenting an alternative choice for voters willing to listen.\n\nHowever, the timing of Romney's speech could not have been more unfavorable, given that President Barack Obama is expected to win 9 out of 10 black votes in November. Wall acknowledged the need to manage expectations and to speak to voters where they are, while also offering an opportunity for those willing to listen to hear Romney's message.",
    " Title: US Deploys Additional Troops to Iraq, Prepares for ISIS Strikes in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has announced plans to increase its military presence in Iraq, with approximately 500 additional troops set to be deployed in the coming week. This brings the total number of troops deployed this summer to over 1,500. Most of these troops will be stationed at operational command centers in Baghdad and Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish north.\n\nThe US military has conducted around 150 airstrikes in Iraq, but these were primarily defensive operations. President Obama has now called for a more aggressive approach, stating, \"It's time to go on offense.\" This new strategy covers operations in Iraq, but a senior defense official notes that the president has the authority to strike ISIS targets in Syria as well.\n\nThe US plan to combat ISIS also involves ramping up assistance to the Syrian opposition. In the coming days, this will include a request to Congress for additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. However, determining the \"moderate opposition\" in Syria has proven challenging, with the less-extreme center of the Syrian opposition being small and shrinking.\n\nAnother issue is that it is unclear if the Free Syrian Army, a group often considered a potential recipient of increased US backing, has a clear vision for what they would do with the Syrian state if they were to gain control. These questions about the \"end state\" in Iraq and Syria are important, as they help shape the Pentagon's strategy.\n\nThe deployment of additional troops and increased support for the Syrian opposition raises complex questions about the potential consequences for regional politics. If ISIS is pushed out of Iraq, for example, this could strengthen the standing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his regime. Similarly, if ISIS is defeated in Syria, it is unclear how the Sunni population in Iraq will respond to the Shiite-led government.\n\nFormer Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has been replaced by Haider al-Abadi, but he may now become vice president, potentially perpetuating lingering resentments among the Sunni population. \"The grievances that drive the Sunnis to fight against the [Iraqi] Army are still there,\" says Ben Connable, senior international policy analyst at the RAND Corp. and a former Marine intelligence officer in Iraq. \"What happens next?\"",
    " Title: Michael Cohen's Shift in Allegiance: From Trump's Fixer to Confessed Liar\n\nMichael Cohen, once known as President Donald Trump's \"pit bull\" and a loyal defender for over a decade, has undergone a significant transformation in his relationship with Trump. From declaring his unwavering loyalty to Trump, Cohen now refers to him as a \"weak person.\"\n\nInitially, Cohen's role was to protect Trump legally, stating, \"If there\u2019s an issue that relates to Mr. Trump that is of concern to him, it\u2019s, of course, of concern to me. And I will use my legal skills within which to protect Mr. Trump to the best of my ability.\" However, the tides turned when the FBI raided Cohen's office in April as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nTrump initially came to Cohen's defense, but as the investigation zeroed in on Cohen, the lawyer began to change his tune. In July, Cohen released a recording of a conversation with Trump from two months before the 2016 election, which appeared to discuss payments to a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. This marked a significant turning point in the relationship between Trump and Cohen.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump expressed his disapproval, stating, \"What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad!\" Cohen responded, \"I expected something like this from Cohen, he\u2019s been lying all week. I mean, for two \u2014 he\u2019s been lying for years. There\u2019s nobody that I know that knows him that hasn\u2019t warned me that if his back is up against the wall, he will lie like crazy, because he\u2019s lied all his life.\"\n\nOn August 21, Cohen pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws. In a surprise court appearance on Nov. 29, Cohen confessed to lying to Congress about negotiations to build a tower in Moscow for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors in the special counsel investigation have interviewed Cohen repeatedly over the past several months.\n\nCohen has cooperated with the investigation, stating, \"Mr. Cohen has cooperated. Mr. Cohen will continue to cooperate.\" Trump has attempted to minimize Cohen's admissions, stating, \"What he\u2019s trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So, he\u2019s lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it.\"",
    " Title: Romney Kicks Off \"Every Town Counts\" Tour in New Hampshire, Focuses on Rural America\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney embarked on a five-day bus tour on Friday, visiting the farm where he launched his presidential campaign last year. The tour, dubbed the \"Every Town Counts\" tour, will take Romney to small towns across several swing states.\n\nDuring his speech at the farm, Romney emphasized the importance of rural America, stating, \"In the days ahead, we'll be traveling on what are often called the backroads of America. But I think our tour is going to take us along what I'll call the backbone of America.\"\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor's campaign is focusing on rural communities, traditionally Republican strongholds, as both presidential candidates attempt to win over voters in these areas. Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies, noted, \"If it's Reagan on a horse or Clinton, the man from Hope, there's always been this kind of visual narrative or this story that to be president you had to be able to handle the wilderness, be comfortable outside of the city. It's just part of the lore.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has also taken notice of rural America, with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack leading the Rural Council, a group of Cabinet members discussing policies aimed at rural America. The council recently released a report detailing improvements in the agricultural economy, including increased exports and record profits for farmers.\n\nHowever, the Romney campaign argues that the Obama administration's success in these areas is due to external factors, such as a weak dollar, rather than administration policies. Jim Talent, a former senator from Missouri advising the Romney campaign, stated, \"Exports are up. That's in part because of the weak dollar\u2014and I guess the administration can claim some credit for that. I mean, the dollar's weak because the economy's weak.\"\n\nDuring the tour, Romney will visit six swing states that went for Obama in 2008, focusing on small towns that voted Republican in the last election in an effort to tip the states in his favor this time. Romney's campaign platform includes proposals for more oil and natural gas drilling, lower taxes, and deficit reduction.\n\nAccording to Dee Davis, in 2008, Obama lost rural counties by a smaller margin than past Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry or Al Gore did. However, rural districts in Congress shifted towards the Republicans in the 2010 elections, with two-thirds of the 60 House seats won by the Republicans coming from rural America. This trend, coupled with Romney's underperformance in small towns during the primary season, presents a challenge for the Republican candidate in winning over rural voters.",
    " Title: California's Proposition 64: A Call for Legalizing and Regulating Marijuana\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 64, also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, aims to legalize, tax, and regulate marijuana for recreational adult use. The proposition is supported by the California Medical Association and is a response to the ongoing federal and state drug laws that ban adult recreational use.\n\nThe argument for Proposition 64 is based on the premise that marijuana is not a dangerous drug and has fewer ill effects compared to alcohol when used in moderation. There has been no known lethal human overdose of marijuana, and it is not in the same class as opioids, which can be fatal.\n\nThe proposition seeks to move marijuana cultivation and sale out of the criminal underground and into a regulated market. This would help end the black market, as stated by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a proponent of the measure. The goal is to regulate and tax marijuana, similar to alcohol, to generate revenue for the state.\n\nCurrently, possession of less than an ounce of marijuana is not even a misdemeanor in California; it is an infraction, punishable by a $100 fine. If Proposition 64 passes, minors caught with an ounce or less would be required to attend drug education or counseling programs and perform community service.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Dublin, has endorsed Proposition 64. As a former prosecutor, Swalwell need not fear being labeled soft on crime. In 2014, he stated that he does not believe legalization would drive up usage.\n\nCritics of Proposition 64 argue that legalizing marijuana could increase squalor on the streets, particularly in cities like San Francisco. However, it is important to note that alcohol and heroin, not marijuana, are the primary contributors to downtown issues. Marijuana smoke, in fact, serves as a deodorant in a city known for its strong odors.\n\nIn conclusion, Proposition 64 aims to legalize and regulate marijuana for adult recreational use in California, with the goal of moving the trade out of the shadows and generating revenue for the state. The proposition is supported by Rep. Eric Swalwell and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, among others. The debate surrounding Proposition 64 continues as the election approaches.",
    " Title: Eleven Democratic Candidates Qualify for Fourth Presidential Debate; Gabbard Falls Short Despite Claiming Third Qualifying Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nEleven Democratic presidential candidates have qualified for the fourth primary debate, scheduled for October 15 and potentially October 16, as per the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The qualification thresholds remain the same as those for the third debate: candidates must attract 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls released between June 28 and October 1, and collect contributions from 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states.\n\nAs of September 9, the candidates who have qualified for the fourth debate are:\n\n* Joe Biden: 16 polls\n* Pete Buttigieg: 16 polls\n* Kamala Harris: 16 polls\n* Bernie Sanders: 16 polls\n* Elizabeth Warren: 16 polls\n* Cory Booker: 13 polls\n* Beto O'Rourke: 12 polls\n* Andrew Yang: 7 polls\n* Juli\u00e1n Castro: 6 polls\n* Amy Klobuchar: 6 polls\n* Tom Steyer: 4 polls\n\nTulsi Gabbard has announced that she has received a third qualifying poll, but the DNC is reviewing a different set of respondents, and the poll will not count for her qualification.\n\nBillionaire activist Tom Steyer qualified for the fourth debate after receiving a qualifying poll from a CBS News/YouGov survey. However, Tulsi Gabbard remains two polls shy of qualification despite some controversy. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released this weekend, Gabbard had 1 percent support among all adult respondents but 2 percent among registered voters. The DNC's policy is to use a poll's top-line number, which in this case was the support among all adults, as it appeared first in the survey.\n\nGabbard's campaign has expressed frustration with the DNC's polling standards in the past, and on Sunday afternoon, well after the poll's release, Gabbard tweeted that the survey was her third poll, despite the DNC's clarification. With less than a month to go until the deadline for qualification for the fourth debate, every poll really does count, and Gabbard is going to need all the help she can get.\n\nSources: Polls, Media Reports.",
    " Title: Senate Reaches Bipartisan Agreement on Human Trafficking Bill, Clearing Path for Attorney General Nominee Loretta Lynch's Confirmation Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a bill aimed at combating human trafficking, paving the way for a confirmation vote on Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch. The agreement, struck on Tuesday, resolves a legislative logjam that has persisted for over a month.\n\nThe confirmation of Ms. Lynch, President Obama's pick to replace Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., has been pending since late last year. Republicans insisted on finishing the human trafficking bill first, with the trafficking bill being held up in a dispute over abortion funding.\n\nOn Tuesday, both parties agreed to shelve the abortion issue by rearranging funding for a victims' fund, drawing money from existing health care funds. The human trafficking bill could receive final approval in the Senate on Wednesday, after which Republicans may move on to Ms. Lynch's confirmation.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington expressed her support for a swift confirmation for Ms. Lynch, who would be the first black woman to hold the nation's top law enforcement post. Ms. Lynch appears to have enough votes for confirmation, though just barely.\n\nMany conservatives have stated they will vote against her, citing her defense of the legality of Mr. Obama's deportation amnesty as evidence that she will not be an independent constitutional referee. The White House has criticized Republican senators for insisting on completing the human trafficking bill first, stating that Ms. Lynch has waited longer than any other attorney general nominee in decades.\n\nSome Senate Democrats have suggested racial motives behind the Republicans' strategy, but the inaction has kept in office Mr. Holder, who is also black and is disliked by Republicans. Republicans have defended their decision to insist on completing the human trafficking bill first, citing its importance in addressing human trafficking.\n\nThe agreement on the human trafficking bill resolves a dispute over the application of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being used for abortions, to fines collected from convicted traffickers. Under the terms of the agreement, money collected from traffickers will not be used for health-related services but will be spent on services such as legal aid for victims. Health services for victims will be paid for by existing community health center funds with abortion restrictions, circumventing the need for another abortion fight.\n\nThe human trafficking bill still needs to pass the full Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised lawmakers a chance to offer amendments. Some Republicans are itching to use the bill as a vehicle for fights over issues such as birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. However, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has warned Republicans not to amend the bill, stating that it would upset the compromise.",
    " Title: Turkey and Syrian Kurds Clash Despite Ceasefire; Erdogan Threatens Kurds\n\nArticle:\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened the Syrian Kurds to withdraw from a safe zone along the Turkey-Syria border by Tuesday night or face further military action. The threat comes as both Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accuse each other of violating a five-day ceasefire brokered by Turkey and the U.S. on Thursday.\n\nViolence has continued in northeast Syria despite the ceasefire, according to reports. Dave Eubank, a private military company employee with Free Burma Rangers, who is on the ground near the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn, stated that the fighting has not stopped, and movement in the area is severely limited. Thousands of Kurdish civilians live in the so-called buffer zone, a senior military source told Fox News.\n\nErdogan made the threat during a televised speech on Saturday, saying, \"We will start where we left off and continue to crush the terrorists' heads.\" The Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was \"still shooting all through the night,\" Eubank said. \"So far since [the] ceasefire, no airstrikes here, but artillery and ground attacks.\"\n\nA senior SDF official later said his forces will pull back from the border area and evacuate Ras al-Ayn, per the temporary peace agreement, as long as there are no delays. Redur Khalil said forces will move back 19 miles from the border, withdrawing from the 75-mile area between Ras al-Ayn and Tal-Aybad. Kurdish forces said they coordinated the withdrawal with the Americans. This is the first time the Kurds have publicly acknowledged they will pull back.\n\nKhalil said a partial evacuation from Ras al-Ayn started Saturday after delays and coordinating with the U.S. Turkey claimed on Saturday it was living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement and accused the Kurds of violating it. The Turkish Defense Ministry said Kurdish forces carried out 14 \"provocative\" attacks in Ras al-Ayn in 36 hours, according to the BBC.\n\nIn a statement, the SDF said there has been \"no tangible progress\" in solving the issues at the northeast border. As of Friday, 86 civilians had been killed since Turkey launched its military offensive into Syria on Oct. 9, according to a war monitor, the BBC reported. Erdogan claimed the move was to \"neutralize terror threats\" and establish a \"safe zone.\" After carrying out airstrikes, Turkish ground troops later invaded northeastern Syria.\n\nNearly all U.S. troops there have been removed and will be redeployed in the region in the coming weeks. The U.S. had teamed up with the Kurds to fight ISIS in the region. Some analysts and politicians criticized President Trump for removing American forces, saying it was a \"green light\" for Ankara to invade Syria and fight the Kurds. Trump said the Turks have been \"warring for many years,\" and that the U.S. does not need to protect war-torn Syria because it's \"7,000 miles away.\" The president on Friday claimed \"thousands and thousands\" of lives were being saved in Syria and Turkey due to the ceasefire.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski's Role Shrinks as Battery Charges Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn public, Donald Trump has continued to stand by his embattled campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who faces battery charges for allegedly grabbing a reporter. However, behind the scenes, Lewandowski's role in the campaign is diminishing.\n\nIn early March, Lewandowski relinquished authority over many hiring decisions to a lower-ranking staffer. In recent days, the campaign's press office has been overriding his decisions about issuing credentials for campaign events. Going forward, Trump's just-named convention manager, Paul Manafort, is expected to take a leading role not just in the selection of delegates but also in the remaining primaries, according to three people close to the campaign.\n\nThe shift in Lewandowski's role is partly a natural outgrowth of the campaign's maturation. However, sources close to the campaign attribute at least part of the change to long-standing concerns among some members of Trump's inner circle about Lewandowski's lack of national experience, his perceived unwillingness to challenge Trump, and his brash temperament.\n\nThese concerns were renewed this week when Lewandowski was charged by police in Jupiter, Florida, with simple battery related to a March 8 encounter with a reporter then working for the conservative Breitbart News.\n\n\"I'm not saying Corey's going to be fired or anything because I don't think he's going to be, at least not at this juncture,\" said a person involved in Trump's campaign. \"But Mr. Trump's listening to other people now. The crew's expanding. The inner circle is not what it used to be.\"\n\nNeither Lewandowski nor the campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, responded to requests for comment.\n\nLewandowski's once-outsized grip on the campaign began loosening soon after voting started this winter, when Michael Glassner's title was changed from national political director to deputy campaign manager, a change billed as a promotion.\n\n\"The move to deputy campaign manager was not something Corey wanted to happen, because it put someone in line as a successor in case he had to leave,\" said the person involved in Trump's campaign. \"It was an odd move to go from national political director to deputy anything.\"\n\nThe move sparked enduring resentment toward Glassner among Lewandowski's loyalists on the campaign, including the many friends he hired from his home state of New Hampshire and a number of his fellow alums of the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity.\n\nOn March 2, the campaign promoted Stuart Jolly, who had served as Southeast political director, to national field director, giving him primary authority over the hiring and firing of field staff. Lewandowski had brought on the former AFP employee.\n\nTrump's candidacy has consisted largely of high-octane rallies, and Lewandowski has been a near-constant presence at Trump's side as the businessman toured the country in his private jet, often making it difficult for other campaign staff and Trump allies to communicate directly with the candidate, who carries a cellphone but does not regularly communicate by email himself.\n\n\"It's hard to get things to Mr. Trump. It's hard to get things around Corey unless you know one of the kids,\" said the person involved in Trump's campaign.\n\nFour people close to the Trump family and campaign say the concerns about Lewandowski's temperament and certain aspects of his performance extend deep into Trump's inner circle.\n\nLewandowski, a former New Hampshire state marine patrol officer, has a history as a confrontational anti-establishment figure stemming from his work running the failed 2002 reelection campaign of Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who was on the outs with the GOP after running for president as an independent two years earlier. Lewandowski cemented his anti-establishment bona fides during his time at Americans for Prosperity, where he antagonized some Republicans.\n\nThat reputation may compromise the campaign's fledgling effort to court the Republican National Committee, its officials, and members, one Trump friend suggested.\n\nPeople close to Trump \"have voiced concerns that Trump is not going to be able to win over the party apparatus if they have someone like Corey running the show,\" the friend said.\n\nBetween March 15 and Trump's reemergence on the campaign trail this week in Wisconsin, the businessman spent several days at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, one of the few places where Lewandowski remains far from his side.\n\nDuring this period, Trump hired Manafort as convention manager, a move first reported by The New York Times on Monday. Manafort, a longtime associate of Roger Stone, Trump's friend and adviser, who left the campaign in August as Lewandowski consolidated control, but continued to serve as a surrogate for Trump and to consult with him.\n\nManafort has quickly taken charge of his own fiefdom in Washington. He is planning to hire a team of his own, which is likely to include several veterans of the 1976 Republican National Convention\u2014the party's last convention at which the presidential nomination was contested\u2014though he remains below Lewandowski on the organizational chart.\n\n\"He technically still reports to Corey, and Corey technically still has the title,\" according to a person familiar with Manafort's role.\n\nOn March 8, Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields alleged Lewandowski roughly grabbed her following a news conference at Trump's golf club in Jupiter. Lewandowski tweeted that Fields was \"delusional\" and that he had never touched her.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Jupiter police released security camera footage showing Lewandowski grabbing Fields and announced that Lewandowski had been arrested on a simple battery charge. Lewandowski and the campaign both maintain Lewandowski's innocence.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lewandowski was scheduled to appear on Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" but the campaign scrapped the appearance.\n\nTrump has forcefully defended his campaign manager in the face of mounting criticism. Trump even blamed Fields for the incident, threatening to file charges against her, saying she grabbed him and that a pen she held in her hand could have been a dangerous weapon.\n\nFollowing scrutiny of the campaign's habit of denying press credentials to reporters whose coverage displeases the candidate and his staff, the press office has overridden Lewandowski's decisions about issuing press credentials, according to the person involved in Trump's campaign.\n\nMany news organizations, including [redacted], have had reporters excluded from Trump's rallies and events, often after publishing stories critical of the candidate or his aides.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allied Nations Discuss Online Extremism and Encryption with Tech Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of racially-motivated attacks, such as the one that occurred at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, which resulted in the deaths of 22 people, there has been a growing concern over the role of online extremism in these incidents. The pattern is clear: hate-filled manifestos posted on websites populated by white supremacists, followed by gun attacks against various minority groups.\n\nFollowing the El Paso attack, President Donald Trump stated his intention to work with law enforcement, as well as social media and technology companies, to develop tools that can detect potential mass shooters before they strike. However, identifying and stopping extremists who plan to launch an attack is a complex issue.\n\nLaw enforcement experts, such as Dave Gomez, a retired FBI agent who has worked on cases of both international and domestic terrorism, emphasize that the constitutional right of free speech means police cannot arrest someone solely based on extremist rants online, unless they make a specific threat.\n\n\"You couldn\u2019t just open a case on the words,\" said Gomez. \"Posting something like that on the internet doesn\u2019t harm anybody. Police can only successfully investigate a white supremacist when you can 'connect his words to an overt act.'\"\n\nThe White House will discuss violent extremism online with representatives from a number of internet and technology companies on Friday, according to a White House spokesman. Social media companies are reluctant to spy on or censor their users, though they are increasingly responding to demands that they take down obvious incitements to violence.\n\nIn an effort to detect national security threats, the FBI, in early July, requested bids for a contractor to help it trawl through social media sites. Top law enforcement and domestic security officials from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand met with leading social media and internet companies in London last week, pushing them to help authorities track suspicious users.\n\nThe government officials noted in an agenda paper for the meeting that some companies \"deliberately design their systems in a way that precludes any form of access to content, even in cases of the most serious crimes.\" The final statement from the meeting said little about encryption, and neither company nor government officials talked about what was discussed.\n\nThe use of broad surveillance powers enacted by Congress in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks has helped law enforcement track international terrorist groups and stop people with links to foreign groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State before they could carry out crimes. However, the key law criminalizing \"material support\" for terrorism does not apply to investigations or prosecutions of domestic terrorists, such as violent white supremacists, who commit hate crimes.\n\nThis week, the FBI Agents Association called on Congress to make domestic terrorism a federal crime in order to give agents more tools. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes internet civil liberties, stated that the sheer amount of users posting aggressive content online makes it almost impossible to identify and track the people who pose an actual threat.\n\n\"Even though it seems like there is another mass shooting every week, if you are looking at the number of mass shooters versus the total population, it\u2019s still a tiny, tiny number which means this is still a very rare event,\" said Jeremy Gillula, the group\u2019s tech products director. \"It\u2019s like trying to predict where lightning is going to strike.\"",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Rules Out Conference on Senate Immigration Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that seemingly confirms the demise of comprehensive immigration reform efforts this year, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has declared that the House will not hold a conference on the Senate-passed immigration bill. Boehner reiterated his long-standing opposition to the bill and stated that the House will never vote on it.\n\nLast week, the third-ranking House Republican, GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-California), indicated that there isn't enough time left this year for the House to take up immigration reform, as the House is in session for only 15 days between now and the end of the year.\n\nFollowing the 2012 presidential election, in which Hispanic voters overwhelmingly voted for President Obama, Boehner expressed the need for Congress to pass major immigration reforms. He stated, \"I think a comprehensive approach is long overdue. And I\u2019m confident that the president, myself, others can find the common ground to take care of this issue once and for all.\"\n\nFacing internal divisions within his conference on the issue, Boehner insists he still wants action but any legislation has to be addressed in pieces. He stated, \"I want us to deal with this issue, but I want to deal with it in a common-sense step-by-step way.\"\n\nA series of targeted immigration bills have passed the House Judiciary Committee, focusing on border security and enforcement, but GOP leaders have not scheduled any floor votes on any of them. A significant bloc of House conservatives is opposed to any measure that provides a path to citizenship or legal status for the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States. So far, none of the House GOP proposals address that issue, but opponents worry that any negotiation with the Senate would increase pressure on House Republicans to deal with questions of citizenship.\n\nBoehner's statement Wednesday, declaring no talks with the Senate on its bill, was designed to put those concerns to rest. The Speaker brushed aside a question of whether House GOP leaders were avoiding the divisive debate on immigration reform to focus on problems with the implementation of Obamacare.\n\n\"This is about trying to do this in a way that the American people and our members can absorb,\" Boehner said, adding that immigration reform is too complicated to rush. \"There are hundreds of issues involved in dealing with immigration reform, and we\u2019ve got to deal with these in a common-sense way where our members understand what we\u2019re doing and their constituents understand.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's Immigration Address Highlights DREAMer's Story, Offers Relief to Millions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his national address on immigration Thursday night, President Barack Obama highlighted the story of Astrid Silva, a DREAMer who felt \"complete relief\" as Obama laid out his plan to shield up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation. Silva, an undocumented immigrant who came to the U.S. with her parents when she was four, was surprised to hear her story told by the President.\n\nDuring his speech, Obama said, \"Astrid was brought to America when she was 4 years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on.\" Silva was motivated to begin advocating for herself and other undocumented immigrants when her grandmother died, and she could not travel to Mexico for her funeral.\n\nObama's orders will give papers and work authorization to up to 4 million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. Silva, who was standing next to her father facing deportation orders during the speech, could benefit from Obama's action as her brother, Silva's brother, is a U.S. citizen, according to the Washington Post.\n\nSilva will meet Obama on Friday when he heads to Las Vegas to continue making his case at a high school. Despite feeling relieved by Obama's actions, Silva stated that what's missing is still \"a law by Congress, since they refused to act on it.\" She added, \"A lot of parents of students who are undocumented are not included. We are going to continue fighting for them, and this is not the end.\"",
    " Title: Social Media and Death Wishes: A Look at Controversial Tweets from Charlie Sheen and Carl Paladino\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of social media, while it offers numerous positive aspects, it also serves as a platform for controversial and offensive content. A recent example of this can be seen in the tweets of actor Charlie Sheen and former New York co-chairman of the Trump campaign, Carl Paladino.\n\nSheen, a well-known liberal figure with a history of alcohol and drug problems, tweeted \"Dear God; Trump next, please! Trump next, please!\" following the deaths of Carrie Fisher and her mother, Debbie Reynolds. This wish for the death of the President-elect sparked backlash, but some social media users defended Sheen, stating that his tweet was not about political differences, but something \"so much worse.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, Paladino, a former gubernatorial candidate and member of the Buffalo school board, made controversial remarks about President Obama and Michelle Obama. He had stated, \"I'd like [Michelle Obama] to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.\" These racist remarks were followed by an apology from Paladino and a denouncement from the Trump campaign.\n\nIt is important to note that while free speech and political views are protected, calls for violence or the use of racist, misogynist, or anti-Semitic language are generally considered unacceptable by decent folks. The response to Sheen's tweet, compared to the reaction that would have likely occurred had a celebrity of his stature called for Obama's death, suggests a possible desensitization to such content on social media platforms.\n\nIn this case, the comparison to Paladino's remarks was made, highlighting the double standard that can exist in the interpretation and response to controversial statements on social media, with some individuals justifying offensive words by those on their political side.\n\nIn conclusion, while social media offers a platform for free speech and political discourse, it is crucial to maintain a level of respect and decency in the content shared. Calls for violence or the use of hate speech should not be tolerated, regardless of political affiliation.",

In a letter released by the White House on Thursday, President Trump expressed his disappointment in recent behavior by the North Korean regime.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate your time, patience, and effort with respect to our recent negotiations and discussions relative to a summit long sought by both parties, which was scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore,\" President Trump wrote. \"We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea, but that to us is totally irrelevant.\"\n\nThe President went on to express his anticipation for the meeting, stating, \"I was very much looking forward to being there with you.\" However, he felt it inappropriate to proceed with the meeting due to the \"tremendous anger and open hostility\" displayed by North Korea in a recent statement.\n\n\"Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place,\" President Trump wrote. He also warned, \"I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me, and ultimately, it is only that dialogue that matters.\"\n\nThe letter comes after repeated threats from North Korea, including nuclear war, and after the regime called Vice President Mike Pence a \"dummy.\" This is a developing story, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.",
    " Title: Hagel Resigns as Defense Secretary Amidst Ongoing Foreign Policy Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Senator Chuck Hagel resigned as Defense Secretary on Monday, following nearly two years of service, during which he oversaw the winding down of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and steered the military through sweeping changes involving gays and women in the military. Hagel's resignation came amidst multiple foreign policy crises, including the rise of the Islamic State group.\n\nIn a radio interview with KFYI, Sen. John McCain, who is expected to take control of the Senate Armed Services Committee in January, expressed his gratitude towards Hagel and criticized the White House for a whispering campaign that accompanied Hagel's abrupt ouster. McCain, who served in the Senate with Hagel from 1996-2008, opposed Hagel's appointment to defense secretary but praised Hagel as an honorable man.\n\nPresident Obama, in a Rose Garden press conference, announced Hagel's decision to step down, stating that it was an \"appropriate time\" for him to complete his service. Obama praised Hagel as \"an exemplary defense secretary\" and a steady hand for strategy and budget. Obama also expressed gratitude for Hagel's honesty, stating that he always \"gave it to me straight.\"\n\nHagel's tenure was marked by a rocky relationship with the White House's insular foreign policy team, and he stepped down under pressure amidst multiple foreign policy crises. Sources told FoxNews.com that Obama's dissatisfaction with Hagel, as well as a desire to shake up the cabinet following the devastating midterm elections, played a role in the president seeking Hagel's ouster.\n\nHagel, a Vietnam veteran and former Republican senator, took office in February 2013, five years after retiring from the Senate. Prior to his political career, Hagel co-founded Vanguard Cellular, worked for an investment banking firm, and ran American Information Systems, a company that makes computerized voting machines. He also taught at Georgetown University after stepping down from the Senate.\n\nA senior defense official said that Hagel submitted his resignation letter to Obama on Monday morning, and the president accepted it. Hagel agreed to remain in office until his successor is confirmed by the Senate. The president is not expected to nominate a new Pentagon chief on Monday.\n\nHagel, the only Republican on Obama's cabinet, served as senator from Nebraska for two terms, beginning in 1996, and became a critic of U.S. involvement in Iraq. Obama nominated him to succeed Leon Panetta as Defense Secretary in his second term.\n\nRecent questions about Hagel's future at the Pentagon were prompted in part by his decision to postpone a long-planned trip this month to Vietnam. At the time, officials said he needed to remain in Washington for congressional consultations, but that did not stop speculation that the White House might be looking for a replacement for the final two years of Obama's term.\n\nJust last week, Hagel was asked about the speculation during an interview on the Charlie Rose show. He was asked whether he's concerned by the speculation. \"No. First of all, I serve at the pleasure of the president,\" Hagel said. \"I'm immensely grateful for the opportunity I've had the last two years to work every day for the country and for the men and women who serve this country. I do not get up in the morning and worry about my job. It's not unusual by the way, to change teams at different times.\"",

The allegations were made to CBS News by VA social worker Germaine Clarno.\n\nWhen asked about the extent of the alleged fraud, Ms. Clarno stated, \"We're talking about surgery, radiology, women's clinic, all those different areas, all the specialties, all the clinics.\" She further added, \"It's hospitalwide.\"\n\nThe alleged manipulation of appointment wait times is not only to game the required appointment wait time but also to collect bonuses for doing so, according to Ms. Clarno. This issue has raised concerns about the treatment of veterans in the VA system, with some questioning the priority given to veterans' health care over budgetary concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has approved the transfer of convicted traitor Bradley Manning from prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to a civilian prison to receive \"gender treatment.\" Manning, who was convicted of sending classified documents to WikiLeaks, has changed his name to \"Chelsea\" and wants hormone therapy and other medical treatment to align with his gender identity.\n\nThe cost of hormone replacement therapy alone could be upwards of $200 per month, for life. The Manning situation has sparked debate over the provision of healthcare to prisoners, with some arguing that denying treatment could amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe allegations of secret appointment lists and the transfer of Manning have raised questions about the prioritization of healthcare in the federal system and the treatment of individuals within it.

    " Title: Study Finds Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions Most Effective in Reducing Partisan Hostility in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study, led by researchers Matt Motyl, Brian Nosek, Jon Haidt, and their collaborators, aimed to determine the most effective strategy for reducing partisan hostility between liberals and conservatives in the United States. The study, which tested five interventions, found that the intervention focused on reducing zero sum perceptions was the most effective at reducing hostility, closely followed by the superordinate threat intervention.\n\nThe five interventions tested in the study were:\n\n1. Self Affirmation: Participants wrote about a valued personal characteristic and a time they embodied that trait.\n2. Learning Political Membership Last: Participants read about a very positive group of individuals, only to later learn that they had volunteered for the opposing political party.\n3. Observing Civility: Participants watched a video describing the relationship between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Tip O'Neill, highlighting their friendly and respectful relationship.\n4. Superordinate Threat: Participants read an article describing the threat of cyber warfare attacks on the United States, concluding that bipartisan efforts could eliminate this threat.\n5. Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions: Participants read an article describing the consequences of a zero-sum mentality and the ways it is inhibiting progress, concluding that shedding this mindset in favor of increased compromise could help both sides achieve their goals.\n\nAfter the intervention phase, participants completed a measure of partisan hostility, indicated their explicit liking of Republicans and Democrats, and completed an implicit measure of political attitudes (the Implicit Association Test). The results showed that each intervention produced the desired effect, that being lower hostility, but the degree to which they were effective varied. Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions was the most effective intervention at reducing hostility, closely followed by Superordinate Threat (although Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions was the only intervention to approach statistical significance, p =.052).\n\nNotably, none of the interventions reduced implicit or explicit liking for one's own party relative to the other party. In fact, most interventions increased partisan preferences relative to the control condition. This demonstrates that promoting civility need not reduce an individual's liking for his or her own group. Rather, hostility can be specifically targeted and reduced without changing these attitudes.\n\nThe results of the intervention contest suggest that there are multiple paths to reducing partisan hostility. However, not all strategies are equally effective. Interestingly, the intervention that produced the best results (Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions) was the least based on past psychological research. As such, when trying to reduce the hostility in the current political environment, I advise paying attention to the nuances of the current sources of hostility. As time goes by, the issues that divide us change. Our attempts to bridge those gaps should adapt with them.\n\nFor more information about the interventions used, see this document: Civil Politics Contest Study-Materials.

    " Title: Federal Judge Halts Obama's Executive Actions on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge in Texas has put a halt to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, two days before they were set to take effect. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled that the president overstepped his authority, halting both the new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and the expansions to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nIn a 120-page court document issued Monday, Hanen wrote that if the executive actions providing legal status to millions of people were to take effect, \"The genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle.\" President Obama, speaking to reporters at the White House, said the Justice Department will appeal this decision, and he is confident that the executive action he took is \"well within my authority.\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson stated that because of the injunction, his agency \"will not begin accepting requests for the expansion of DACA tomorrow, February 18, as originally planned.\" Until further notice, they will also suspend the plan to accept requests for DAPA. Johnson added that the court's order \"does not affect the existing DACA,\" and that it will not change the enforcement priorities he outlined when President Obama set his plan in motion last November.\n\nObama called on Congress to act and said he had taken this action because he would not \"stand by and do nothing.\" He said while he disagreed with Hanen's opinion, \"I respect the ruling.\" The Justice Department will appeal the judge's temporary injunction, the White House says.\n\nThe injunction gives 26 states more time to form legal arguments against the actions, which were expected to protect as many as 4 million people who are in the U.S. illegally from being deported. The plan also includes an option to apply for work permits. The states had argued that the changes would cause \"dramatic and irreparable injuries.\"\n\nOn the other side of the issue, there are 12 states, the District of Columbia, and 33 mayors across the country who are supporting the Obama administration. They say the executive action would benefit them, as workers who are here illegally would come out of the shadows and work and pay taxes.\n\nObama announced his plan weeks after last November's midterm elections, saying that he was taking action because Congress had not sent him a bill addressing the problems in America's immigration system. Before the ruling came out late Monday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency had been preparing to begin accepting applications under the new rules on Wednesday.\n\nThe Texas lawsuit against the president's executive orders was initially filed in December by Gov. Greg Abbott, who was then the state's attorney general. Abbott accused the president of violating several provisions of the U.S. Constitution, including one that gives Congress jurisdiction over immigration laws. Abbott also argued that Texas would be irreparably harmed by the action. He cited as proof last summer's surge of undocumented immigrants from Central America who entered Texas illegally through the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nWelcoming the injunction, the current attorney general in Texas, Ken Paxton, called it \"a victory for the rule of law in America and a crucial first step in reining in President Obama's lawlessness.\" In his decision, Judge Hanen, an appointee of President George W. Bush who has been in his post since 2002, also noted that there has been a political and national debate over how to handle both legal and illegal immigration.

The indictment alleges that van der Zwaan, who is based in London, lied about his communications with Rick Gates, former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort's deputy, and an unidentified individual (Person A) during the investigation into Manafort and Gates' ties to the Kremlin.\n\nVan der Zwaan's connection to the Russia case stems from his work at Skadden Arps, a large corporate law firm, in the early 2010s. During this time, Manafort and Gates were working for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin-backed leader. Yanukovych was embroiled in a power struggle with another prominent Ukrainian politician, and Manafort and Gates were tasked with covering up Yanukovych's undemocratic prosecution of the politician by commissioning a report from van der Zwaan and his team at Skadden Arps, which concluded that there was no political motive for the imprisonment.\n\nThe Skadden Arps report, while significant in Ukraine, was a relatively obscure issue for most of the world. Manafort and Gates continued their work for Yanukovych after the report's completion, and van der Zwaan moved on to other assignments. However, the Mueller investigation would soon bring van der Zwaan's work back into focus.\n\nIn November 2017, FBI agents questioned van der Zwaan about his communications with Gates and Person A in relation to the Skadden Arps report. According to the indictment, van der Zwaan lied about his last communication with Gates, stating it was an \"innocuous text message\" in August 2016, and that he had not spoken to Person A since 2014. The indictment alleges that van der Zwaan was, in fact, secretly communicating with Gates and Person A about the Skadden report in September 2016 and had surreptitiously recorded the call. The indictment also alleges that van der Zwaan deleted an email between himself and Person A sent around the same time as those conversations and told the FBI that he \"did not know\" where the email was.\n\nVan der Zwaan is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday at 2:30 pm EST to answer the indictment. He is expected to plead guilty, according to reports.\n\nThe key piece of information in this case is the timing: Manafort resigned as Trump's campaign manager on August 19, 2016, weeks before the alleged conversations between Gates, Person A, and van der Zwaan. If Gates and van der Zwaan were discussing the Skadden report in September 2016, and van der Zwaan felt the need to lie to the FBI about it, it suggests that there may have been something criminal about the report's production or something whose release would be politically damaging.\n\nInterestingly, both CBS News and the Los Angeles Times reported on Monday that Gates had struck a plea deal with Mueller and would testify against Manafort, his former boss. It is not a stretch to think that evidence provided by van der Zwaan, such as his \"surreptitious\" recording of his call with Gates and Person A, helped Mueller build a case strong enough that Gates had no choice but to flip.\n\nGates, as Manafort's longtime assistant, might have valuable information about Manafort, who is one of the most pivotal players in the Trump-Russia scandal. It is conceivable that van der Zwaan might be the first domino in a chain of events that leads to a major breakthrough\u2014a Manafort conviction or plea deal.\n\nRight now, that is speculation: We don't know how the Manafort case is actually going to play out. But that is almost certainly Mueller's strategy\u2014get van der Zwaan to get to Gates to get to Manafort, and from there, get vital information about Trump's real ties to Russia.\n\nWhat this shows, more than anything else, is how methodical and wide-ranging the Mueller investigation is\u2014that it's willing to look all the way back to an obscure report from the winter of 2012 in order to get to the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal. Mueller is starting at the lowest level, with seemingly unrelated people like van der Zwaan, to get to the big fish.",
    " Title: Senate Approves Online Sales Tax Legislation; House Passage Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has approved legislation that would require e-commerce businesses with over $1 million in annual sales to collect state and local sales taxes on goods delivered to states that would normally impose such taxes. The Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA), which passed with a vote of 69 to 27, now moves to the House of Representatives.\n\nHowever, the MFA's passage through the House is uncertain due to the reservations of key Republican lawmaker Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Despite bipartisan support, the legislation will need to pass through Goodlatte's committee before it can be voted on by the full House.\n\nConservative groups argue that it is unconstitutional to force e-retailers to collect sales tax when they have no physical presence in a state. They also contend that the legislation will diminish tax competition among the states and be difficult for online retailers to enforce, given the numerous jurisdictions that collect a sales tax.\n\nProponents of the MFA, including conventional retailers and state governments, argue that it will \"level the playing field\" between brick-and-mortar businesses and Internet-only companies that have not charged sales tax in the past. They claim that the software now available makes it possible for retailers to calculate sales taxes just as easily as they calculate shipping charges. The law mandates that each state make sales tax software available free of charge to e-commerce businesses.\n\nMost states are in favor of the law, as they see a large pot of uncollected sales taxes. A 2009 University of Tennessee study projected unpaid sales taxes from Internet sales would amount to $23 billion in 2012.\n\nThe dispute over collecting sales tax dates back to a 1992 US Supreme Court decision that barred states from requiring a retailer to collect sales taxes on its behalf unless the retailer had a physical presence in the taxing state. The MFA is an attempt to change the law.\n\nImmediately after the MFA cleared the Senate, Representative Goodlatte expressed disappointment that the latest version did not follow \"regular order\" in the Senate, but instead bypassed the Senate committee with subject-matter expertise. Goodlatte has already indicated that he has deep reservations about the MFA. He is concerned that the legislation does not make tax collection simpler and that aggressive state tax bureaus could try to pry money from e-retailers in other states that the bureaus did not think complied with the legislation.\n\nThe dispute over the MFA's future remains uncertain, with some independent analysts questioning if the legislation has a future due to Goodlatte's reservations. However, not all conservatives oppose the legislation. On May 6, Colin Hanna of Let Freedom Ring and Al Cardenas of the American Conservative Union endorsed the bill. MFA proponents hope that this argument ultimately sways the House to approve the legislation.",
    " Title: U.S. Cancels Long-Range Missile Interceptors in Europe, Shifts Focus to North Korea Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has announced the cancellation of 14 interceptors intended for a missile defense system in Europe, a move that abandons a part of a European system strongly opposed by Russia. This decision could potentially open the door for new arms control talks.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel revealed the cancellation on Friday, citing development problems and a lack of funding. The interceptors, initially planned for deployment in Poland and possibly Romania in the early 2020s, were part of an overall restructuring of missile defense plans aimed at countering missiles from North Korea and Iran.\n\nThe shift in U.S. missile defense plans in Europe is the second major change to the program since President Barack Obama took office. This change could cause unease among some U.S. allies, including Poland and Romania, who view the system as a sign of U.S. engagement in the region and a counterweight to Russia.\n\nThe restructuring includes spending $1 billion to add the 14 new interceptors to the 26 that are in underground silos in Alaska. The European-based interceptors would not have protected the United States from North Korea.\n\nThe U.S. commitment to missile defense in the region \"remains ironclad,\" Hagel said, without making any reference to Russia's objections to the European plans. Other parts of the program in Europe will move forward.\n\nMissile defense has been a contentious issue since President George W. Bush sought to base long-range interceptors in Central Europe to stop Iranian missiles from reaching the U.S. Russia believed the program was aimed at countering its own missiles and undermining its nuclear deterrent.\n\nObama reworked the Bush administration's plan soon after taking office in 2009. He canceled an earlier interceptor planned for Poland and radar in the Czech Republic, replacing high-speed interceptors with slower ones that could stop Iran's medium-range missiles.\n\nUnder Obama's plan, the interceptors were to be upgraded gradually over four phases, culminating early next decade with those intended to protect both Europe and the United States. Russia initially welcomed the changes to the Bush plan, and relations between the two powers improved. That, in turn, paved the way for the New START treaty setting new limits on both countries' nuclear arsenals.\n\nHowever, Moscow has ramped up its criticism of Obama's revisions, which are backed by NATO, and claims the fourth and last planned upgrade of the interceptors would be able to stop its intercontinental missiles launched at the U.S. and undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent.\n\nThe decision to cancel plans for the long-range interceptors will help the president's arms control goals, according to Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association. \"We give up nothing since Phase 4 was not panning out anyway. This is a win-win for the United States,\" Collina said.\n\nThe U.S. informed Poland and Romania of the decision ahead of the announcement, but Russia was not. The cancellation was criticized by Republicans in Congress, who have charged that Obama has undermined allies while pursuing his goals to drastically cut nuclear weapons.\n\nThe U.S. remains committed to all the other parts of the plan, including the first three phases. The decision was prompted by the need to address faster-than-anticipated progress by North Korea on nuclear weapons and missiles. The changes free up the money to do so, Hagel said.\n\nHagel cited North Korea's December rocket launch that put a satellite into space and showed mastery of some of the technologies needed to produce a long-range nuclear missile. He noted that last April, the North Koreans publicly displayed a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, the KN-08. Navy Adm. James Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that missile is believed to be capable of reaching the U.S.\n\nThe missile defense system was first fielded by the Bush administration in late 2004. It has a spotty test record and has never been used in actual combat. In addition to the 26 interceptors in Alaska, the system includes four interceptors in California. The 14 additional interceptors should be in place in Alaska by September 2017, but not before they have been tested adequately.",

    " Title: Koch Network Launches Campaign to Oppose Donor Disclosure Measure in South Dakota\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A group tied to billionaire Charles Koch has launched an aggressive campaign to oppose a ballot measure in South Dakota that would require Koch-affiliated groups and others like them to reveal their donors' identities. The measure, known as Initiated Measure 22, calls for public disclosure of donors who fund advocacy efforts, the creation of a state ethics commission, and public financing of political campaigns.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity (AFP), the largest activist group in the policy and political empire founded by industrialist Koch and his brother, David, has formed a coalition called Defeat 22 to fight the measure. The coalition has already run commercials on talk radio and country-music stations, contacted 50,000 voters through phone calls and door-knocking, and distributed mailers denouncing the initiative as a money-grab by politicians.\n\nBen Lee, the state director of Americans for Prosperity and chairman of Defeat 22, stated that the South Dakota fight is a battle to protect donors' free-speech rights. Luke Hilgemann, AFP's national CEO, argued that revealing donors' identities could subject them to threats and intimidation and drive them away from funding advocacy groups.\n\nThe Koch network is one of the most influential groups in conservative politics. Some 700 like-minded donors each pledge to give at least $100,000 annually to a mix of educational, policy, and political organizations affiliated with the Kochs that push a small-government agenda. The network is on track to spend about $750 million during the 2016 election cycle, about a third of which will be directed to politics. A large share of the network's money flows through nonprofits whose donors are anonymous.\n\nKoch officials say preserving \"free speech\" is among their top priorities in the coming years. \"Wherever there are threats against the First Amendment, we will be there to weigh in,\" Hilgemann said.\n\nThe South Dakota measure would not bar donations to nonprofit groups active in politics, but it would require the groups running independent ads and distributing mailers to disclose the identities of anyone who gives more than $100 in a calendar year. The early spending against the measure caught organizers by surprise, with former GOP state senator Don Frankenfeld stating, \"We're scrambling now to mount an appropriate response to the misleading charge that it's a raid on the treasury for politicians.\"\n\nOn the other side, Massachusetts-based Represent.Us is waging bipartisan campaigns around the country to end anonymous contributions in politics and pass laws it says will curb public corruption. Represent.Us and other advocacy groups helped successfully pass similar measures in Seattle and Maine last year. In addition to South Dakota, two more initiatives that deal with either campaign finance or lobbying issues are headed to voters this fall, in San Francisco and Washington state.\n\nBoth sides view South Dakota as an important test in a year when voter anger about the role of moneyed interests in politics helped buoy the White House candidacies of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Republican nominee Donald Trump. Republicans control the governors' mansion in South Dakota and both houses of the state legislature. A former GOP state senator, Don Frankenfeld, is helping run the \"Yes 22\" campaign in the state.\n\n\"If it can happen in South Dakota, it can happen in 10 or 20 other states,\" Hilgemann said. The early spending against the measure caught organizers by surprise, with Frankenfeld stating, \"We're scrambling now to mount an appropriate response to the misleading charge that it's a raid on the treasury for politicians.\"",
    " Title: Western Powers Join Search for Kidnapped Nigerian Schoolgirls as Frustration Grows Over Government Response\n\nArticle:\n\nWestern powers, including the United States, United Kingdom, and France, have announced they will join the search for hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamic terrorists, as parents' frustration grows over the Nigerian government's response. A small team of U.S. military personnel is expected to arrive in Abuja, Nigeria, in the coming days to assist in the search. The team will consist of approximately 10 uniformed soldiers from AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. They will be logistics and communications experts who will assess the situation and advise Nigerian officials, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. The U.S. military has no plans to carry out a rescue mission.\n\nThe team is part of a larger U.S. contingent that includes officials from the FBI and the departments of Defense, Justice, and State. The total number of U.S. personnel is not expected to exceed 20 members. France has also announced it will send security service agents to help track down the Boko Haram terror group and its hostages.\n\nChina has offered to send satellite intelligence to help Nigeria's army locate the girls, and the U.K. plans to send in a team of experts, according to reports. The pledges of support come amid mounting frustration among parents of the kidnapped girls who are worried about what Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau and his army of jihadist fighters might do to their daughters in the days to come. The group has vowed to sell into slavery the roughly 275 kidnapped teenage girls.\n\n\"We do not know where they are and we do not know what is happening to them,\" one parent, who declined to be identified, told Deutsche Welle. He said some parents are so afraid to lose their daughters that they have stopped eating. The Nigerian government is offering a $300,000 reward for information leading to Shekau's capture, and the United States is offering a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his location.\n\nLocal residents have reportedly pooled money for motorcycles to head into the forest in search of the girls missing since last month's abduction and those who have since been abducted. Nigeria's government has come under fire over its response to the kidnapping. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, said Wednesday that the Nigerian government has been \"somewhat derelict in its responsibility toward protecting boys and girls, men and women, in northern Nigeria in the last years.\"\n\nHowever, a senior adviser to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan told The Washington Post that it was \"not helpful\" to fault the government. He called for greater international assistance in the country's fight against terrorism. \"The Nigerian government is doing all it can in collaboration with its allies to ensure that our daughters, the girls, are brought back home\u2014everything in its power,\" Douglas told the paper during a visit to Washington on Wednesday.\n\nAt least two girls have reportedly died of snakebites, and roughly 20 others are thought to be ill. Shekau made his plans clear in a video released Monday in which he gloated about the kidnappings. \"I abducted your girls,\" he said in the hour-long video that opens with fighters shooting guns into the air and shouting \"Allahu akbar\" and \"By Allah, I will sell them in the marketplace.\"\n\nShekau's army is estimated to number from a few hundred to a few thousand fighters. In recent days, Boko Haram also has raided villages in and around the forest, including a raid Monday night on a village near the border with Chad in which eight more girls were kidnapped. A source said the hostages are being transported from one base to another, typically during the cover of nightfall, to avoid detection.\n\nShekau was reportedly Boko Haram's deputy leader until its founder, Mohammed Yusuf, was killed by local authorities in 2009. In 2012, Shekau was declared a \"specially designated global terrorist\" for numerous bombings, including the August 2011 attack on the United Nations office complex in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, that killed 23 people and injured dozens more.\n\nOn Wednesday, as many as 300 people were killed when extremists attacked the town of Gamboru Ngala on Nigeria's border with Cameroon, according to local reports. The attack and hundreds of casualties were confirmed by Borno state information commissioner Mohammed Bulama who spoke to The Associated Press by telephone. Shops and homes were set ablaze and razed in the attack, he said.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Extend Tax Breaks and Confirm Judicial Nominees, Fail to Pass Terrorism Risk Insurance Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a final flurry of activity on Tuesday, lawmakers managed to pass a bill that extends a package of expired tax breaks and confirmed 12 judicial nominees. This development, as reported by NPR's Ailsa Chang, marked a significant achievement for the Obama administration, with the President confirming 88 judges this year, nearly double the number from the previous year.\n\nThe extension of the tax breaks, however, will last only slightly over two weeks, expiring at the end of 2014. The bill, according to Forbes, was \"quite literally the best we could do,\" as stated by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT). Politico described the bill as \"that nobody really wanted,\" referencing an earlier effort by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to build legislation that would have lasted two years.\n\nThe White House, in a pre-emptive veto threat, expressed dissatisfaction with the tax breaks extension, complaining that it failed to make permanent an expansion of its favored tax credits for working families. This move effectively killed any remaining attempts to pass a two-year extension that had been approved by the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nSenate Democrats were further disappointed by the failure to pass a bill authorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) blocked a vote on the bill, effectively killing the legislation, as reported by The Hill. Coburn, who had threatened to take this action, refused to agree to a unanimous consent request that would have set up a final vote on the measure, requiring a 60-vote majority for passage.\n\nIn a positive note, President Obama, according to a White House statement, signed the government funding bill that will last through September of next year. The only exception is the Department of Homeland Security, which is funded through February. The Senate also confirmed several other of the President's nominations, including Anthony Blinken as Deputy Secretary of State and Vivek Murthy as the country's new Surgeon General, a position that had been vacant for 17 months.",
    " Title: FBI Identifies and Arrests Suspect in Partisan Bombing Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 FBI Director Christopher Wray, known for his restrained rhetoric, described the swift resolution of a series of partisan bombing attacks as a Hollywood-like operation during a Justice Department briefing on Friday. The lone suspect in the bombing campaign, 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc, was identified and apprehended following a nationwide manhunt.\n\nThe breakthrough in the investigation came on Wednesday when two of the 13 un-exploded devices, one addressed to President Barack Obama and another to Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), were delivered to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis.\n\nInvestigators discovered a fingerprint on the envelope containing the device intended for Waters. By Thursday, they had matched the single print to Sayoc, who has a criminal record in Florida. Further examination of both the Waters and Obama devices revealed DNA among the components of the pipe-bombs, which were crudely constructed using six-inch PVC cylinders, small timers, batteries, wiring, and \"energetic material.\"\n\nLate Thursday night, federal investigators enlisted the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to compare the recovered DNA with existing samples taken from Sayoc in previous criminal cases. By Friday morning, federal authorities, who had been investigating the case for just four days, were ready to move in.\n\n\"This is phenomenal work, with the greatest pressure, under an incredibly tight time frame,\" Wray said during the briefing. \"We see unbelievable work like this on TV shows and in Hollywood, but to see it up close, in reality, is something to behold.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions and Wray, who have faced criticism from President Donald Trump, acknowledged the significance of the quick resolution of such a disturbing case. \"This is a demonstration of the skill, the capability, and determination of our American law enforcement,\" Sessions said on Friday.\n\n\"We've caught the right guy...

    " Title: Michigan Becomes 24th Right-to-Work State as Governor Signs Controversial Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nMichigan has become the 24th state to adopt right-to-work legislation, with Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, signing the bills into law on Tuesday. The House approved two bills, which were also passed by the Senate last week. Both chambers are dominated by Republicans.\n\nThe new legislation allows workers at union-represented employers to opt out of paying union dues. Thousands of people, many of them union workers, gathered outside the statehouse, chanting and holding signs as snow fell. At least three school districts were closed as teachers traveled to Lansing to protest.\n\nMichigan, with 17.5% of employees represented by unions, would be the most heavily unionized state to pass such legislation. It would join neighboring Indiana in converting to right-to-work this year.\n\nUnion leaders, such as UAW President Bob King, have expressed concerns about the impact of the legislation. \"It would devastate the workers,\" King told CNN Tuesday morning. \"We're worried about all workers in the state of Michigan.\"\n\nSupporters of the bill argue it will help attract businesses to the state, but critics say it will weaken labor's bargaining strength by cutting union financial resources without bringing in more jobs.\n\nAccording to Richard Hurd, professor of labor studies at the ILR School at Cornell University, employees in right-to-work states have lower wages, on average, than their counterparts elsewhere. This is because unions are weaker in those states and are less effective in bargaining for higher wages. Only two-thirds of workers join unions in right-to-work states, on average.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning organization, reports that the average full-time, full-year worker in a right-to-work state makes about $1,500 less annually. The rate of workers covered by employer-sponsored health insurance is 2.6 percentage points lower, while pension coverage is 4.8 percentage points lower.\n\nRight-to-work states have seen employment expand by 8.2% between 2001 and 2010, according to State Budget Solutions, an advocacy group that supported the measure. In contrast, those without the law experienced a 0.5% decrease, according to the group's analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.\n\nThe passage of the measure symbolizes the declining fortunes of the nation's once powerful union movement. Only four states have passed right-to-work laws since the 1960s.\n\n\"If right-to-work passes in Michigan, it demonstrates the weakness of the labor movement,\" Hurd said. \"If it can happen in Michigan, there's a feeling it can happen anywhere.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's Visit to Israel Amidst Arab-Israeli Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Barack Obama lands in Israel on Wednesday, he will not be entering a morally neutral landscape, but rather a region fraught with the complexities of the Arab-Israeli conflict. To navigate successfully, Obama should adhere to a moral compass emphasizing inalienable rights, starting with equality and freedom from racial and religious intolerance.\n\nThe Palestinian appeals Obama may encounter will be framed in emotive language, focusing on issues such as Jewish settlements on Arab land and \"apartheid walls\" surrounding them. Settlements are widely perceived as a significant point of contention between the United States and Israel.\n\nIn May 2009, Obama became the first U.S. president to demand a total settlement freeze from Israel, stating this during a press briefing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel responded with a unilateral moratorium on new settlement construction, but it expired in September 2010 without reciprocal action from the Palestinian Authority. Since then, the Palestinian Authority has refused to resume negotiations.\n\nThe Palestinian political machine has leveraged every international forum to make settlements the central sticking point. A recent example is a new UN report from a \"fact-finding mission\" that investigated rights violations allegedly caused by Israeli settlements.\n\nHowever, at the heart of the opposition to settlements lies the endorsement of another Arab country without Jews, with the creation of what is best described as 'apartheid Palestine' being the ultimate goal.\n\nThe Middle East Road Map, endorsed by the Security Council in 2003, labeled settlements a \"final status\" issue to be \"negotiated between the parties\" because the ownership of the land and the longevity of settlements had not, and has not, been determined. If negotiators decide that a particular territory will become part of a future Palestinian state, why should an exodus of current Jewish inhabitants be automatic?\n\nIsrael has a history of uprooting Jewish settlements under difficult circumstances. Israeli governments have included settlements in negotiations and stand ready to negotiate without preconditions. The claim that settlements are an obstacle to peace, therefore, resonates for the wrong reasons, as the UN demonstrates: anti-Semitism and the objection to any Jewish state are at the root of it all.\n\nThe Human Rights Council's settlement report, currently being applauded in Geneva, has one annex. It begins: \"Timeline \u2013 Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestine Territory 1948.\" Not 1967. The report's pseudo-legal analysis objects to \"Settlement Master Plans.\" The lingo \u2013 invented by the report's authors \u2013 is an unmistakable allusion to the deportation \"master plan\" of Nazi SS chief Heinrich Himmler.\n\nThe \"selected sources\" upon which the UN \"fact-finders\" relied (and which are posted on the UN's website) include tales that Israel is deliberately dumping \"waste\" in the territories to increase cancer and miscarriages among Palestinians and declarations that Israelis harbor \"racist beliefs of Jewish supremacy.\"\n\nThe link between the anti-settlement battle cry and the racist challenge to the Jewish state's legitimacy is also apparent from the General Assembly's most recent fall session. Last November, 120 countries, represented by the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement, and its spokesperson Iran, denounced: \"the racism of Israel and its settlers\"; \"Israel's racist, inhumane policies...feverish settler campaigns and systemic killing of civilians\"; \"the terror, violence, and provocations by extremist Israeli settlers\"; \"The era of Zionism is over.\"\n\nIn short, the demonization and delegitimization of settlements are inextricably connected to the demonization and delegitimization of Israel itself. In March 2011, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered 3-month-old \"extremist settler\" Hadas Fogel, and her 11-year-old brother Yoav, 4-year-old brother Elad, and her parents Ehud and Ruth. In January 2012, Palestinian Authority official television broadcast and re-broadcast a program in which family members of the convicted murderers \u2013 egged on by the PA TV host \u2013 praised the \"operation.\"\n\nFacilitating the creation of apartheid Palestine is not a confidence-building measure. It will not produce a peace partner or spawn a law-abiding future neighbor. Enabling apartheid Palestine should be an anathema to every post-segregationist fiber in the American body politic, starting with President Obama.",
    " Title: Obama Reiterates Islam Does Not Represent Terrorism at Countering Violent Extremism Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama emphasized on Thursday that Islamist terrorist groups, such as al Qaeda, ISIS, and Boko Haram, do not represent Islam, referring to the idea that the West is at war with Islam as an \"ugly lie.\" The president made these remarks during the closing session of a summit on \"Countering Violent Extremism,\" hosted by the U.S. State Department in Washington.\n\nObama urged the nations gathered to remain steadfast in their fight against terrorist organizations. In his address, the president seemed to address administration critics who have noted the White House's reluctance to use the term \"Islamic\" when referring to such terrorist groups.\n\n\"Obviously, there is a complicated history between the Middle East and the West, and none of us, I think, should be immune from criticism in terms of specific policies,\" Obama cautioned. \"But the notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie -- and all of us, regardless of our faith, have a responsibility to reject it.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the president explained that he avoids mentioning Islam when discussing terrorism to prevent Islamic radicals from using such references for recruitment purposes. \"We must acknowledge that groups like al Qaeda and ISIS are deliberately targeting their propaganda to Muslim communities, particularly Muslim youth,\" he said.\n\nThe president's refusal to acknowledge any connection between Islamic State terrorists and Islam has been met with criticism. Cliff May, president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, suggested that the president and his administration should acknowledge that radical Islam is the root cause of terrorism and groups like ISIS.\n\n\"We're kind of avoiding making decisions now and we're saying things that really nobody that's informed about these matters can actually believe,\" May told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News. \"He thinks he's doing it because he wants to avoid the impression that this is in any way a religious war \u2013 it was 21 Coptic Christians who had their heads taken off by the Islamic State.\"\n\nThis week's White House summit followed the State Department's recent, quiet meeting with members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has sparked outrage from the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Zvi Mazel, former Israeli ambassador to Egypt, questioned the reasoning behind the meeting.\n\n\"So how come, the United States, the administration, in that case the president himself and the State Department, receive delegation of the Muslim Brothers?\" Mazel asked.",
    " Title: Military's Mavni Program Faces Tightened Vetting and Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (Mavni) program, established in 2008, has seen a significant shift in recruitment and vetting processes in recent years. The program primarily targets individuals with language skills in strategically important languages such as Chinese, Korean, or Russian, as well as those with medical training and college degrees. Over 10,000 troops have joined the military through this program since its inception, with the majority serving in the Army.\n\nIn response to potential security concerns, the Defense Department has implemented stricter vetting procedures for immigrant recruits. These enhanced background checks now extend to recruits seeking roles as clerks, mechanics, and surgeons, mirroring the level of scrutiny previously reserved for troops requiring top-secret clearance. The additional layers of scrutiny include reviews by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a decade-long financial history examination, an extensive questionnaire, and numerous lengthy interviews.\n\nThe increased vetting process has led to significant delays, with thousands of recruit reviews accumulating in a backlog. Recruits have reportedly waited years for the clearances necessary to advance in their military careers, and in some cases, initial screenings have expired and must be repeated. As a result, the Army has reportedly begun discharging recruits, even in the absence of security concerns.\n\n\"They were being discharged even if there was not a security concern,\" said Ms. Cutler, a representative for the Mavni program. \"These are often highly skilled individuals, many have master's degrees.\"\n\nIn July, government lawyers labeled the Mavni program an \"elevated security risk\" and claimed that some recruits had provided false information to obtain student visas and that others had friends associated with foreign intelligence organizations.\n\nHowever, a 2017 report by the RAND Corporation found no evidence that the Mavni program had caused any security problems. The report, which has not been officially released, found that the program's recruits were generally better educated and performed better than the average enlisted soldier, and had not been involved in terrorism or espionage.\n\nMargaret D. Stock, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve who helped create the program and is now an immigration lawyer representing some Mavni soldiers, suggests that the military may be seeking to curtail the Mavni program due to administrative burdens and excessive regulations.",
    " Title: House to Vote on Resolution to Block President Trump's Border Emergency Declaration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives plans to vote on a resolution Tuesday aimed at blocking President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency along the southern border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the move on Friday.\n\nPelosi described the president's declaration as an attempt to honor an applause line in a rally, and criticized the move as disrespectful to the legislative branch and the Constitution. \"Not only is he disrespecting the legislative branch and the Constitution of the United States, he is dishonoring the office in which he serves,\" said Pelosi, who spoke from the border city of Laredo, Texas.\n\nTrump announced the declaration last week as a means of freeing up billions to pay for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border after Congress failed to provide the money he demanded. Democrats have called the declaration an overreach of Trump's power and have vowed to fight it. Their resolution, if passed by both chambers of Congress, would terminate the emergency declaration. However, if Congress approves it, the president could veto it.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump vowed to veto the resolution \"100 percent.\" \"And I don't think it survives a veto,\" the president predicted.\n\nThe resolution is expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House, but its future is uncertain in the Republican-held Senate. Unlike most legislation, the resolution is rooted in a provision from the National Emergencies Act that would require it to be voted upon within 18 calendar days after it is introduced and then be sent to the Senate.\n\nMany Republicans have expressed discomfort with the president declaring a national emergency to secure funding for a wall along the southern border, but it's unclear whether they would vote for such an effort.\n\nThe bill is expected to pass the House, but its future is uncertain in the Republican-held Senate. However, unlike most legislation, the resolution is rooted in a provision from the National Emergencies Act that would require it to be voted upon within 18 calendar days after it is introduced and then be sent to the Senate.\n\nNormally, if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not want to bring legislation from the House to the floor, he can block it from getting a vote. But once this bill passes the House \u2013 which is expected to do so \u2013 the Senate will have to take it up within 18 days of receiving it.\n\nIn addition to the resolution, Pelosi on Friday did not rule out committee chairmen filing lawsuits over the wall. Sixteen states have already filed a lawsuit over Trump's emergency declaration, arguing it exceeds the power of the president and unconstitutionally redirects federal money that Congress had set aside for other purposes.\n\nThe White House officials have said the emergency declaration and other budget maneuvers would free up an additional $6.6 billion, which would build at least 234 miles of border wall. The fight over wall funding led to a 35-day government shutdown \u2013 the longest on record.",

    " Title: Trump Administration Increases Military Involvement in Ongoing War on Terror\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's approach to the war on terror, as outlined fifty days into the new administration, is showing a renewed focus on counterterrorism efforts, particularly in Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nIn Yemen, the U.S. has reportedly increased its bombing campaign against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) following a late January raid. According to Foreign Policy, the Obama administration had handed over plans for a stepped-up campaign to the incoming Trump team in January, and there has been an immediate change in the tempo of operations. The U.S. has now reportedly dropped more bombs on Yemen than in any previous year.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the Trump administration is considering an increase in troop levels in the 15-and-a-half-year war, where the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has recently established a presence. General Joseph Votel, the head of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in Egypt, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia, suggested a few thousand more troops above the 8,500 currently deployed in Afghanistan are needed to break a \"stalemate\" with the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S. is also reportedly deploying additional troops to Syria, with The New York Times reporting the deployment of 400 troops ahead of the campaign to take Raqqa, ISIS' self-proclaimed capital. The U.S. is also deploying 2,500 additional troops to a staging base in Kuwait in support of the campaign against ISIS, although military leaders would not speak to the media about the plans for these troops.\n\nThe Iraqi government took no formal diplomatic action after it was included in President Trump's first executive order travel ban, instead lobbying members of the administration to be removed from the next version. Iraq's removal from the ban was also recognized as being motivated by its assistance in the campaign against ISIS.\n\nFinally, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to expand the use of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called it a \"very fine place\" to hold unlawful enemy combatants, and suggested the military would decide whether to hold suspects there and whether and how to prosecute them. This shift is in line with the Trump administration's privileging of military decision-making priorities in the conduct of the war on terror.\n\nThe Trump administration inherited battlegrounds in the war on terror all over the world and, thanks to years of Congressional inaction, few limits to how to interpret the post-9/11 authorization of the use of military force (AUMF) which has been used since its passage as legal justification for military actions in places like Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq after the Iraq war-related withdrawal, against not just Al-Qaeda and \"associated forces\" but offshoots like ISIS which have become rivals. During the campaign, Trump suggested he would be open to some kind of Congressional vote on an AUMF specifically for ISIS, but despite a bipartisan push no such votes have yet materialized.",
    " Title: PolitiFact's Assessment of Hillary Clinton's Truthfulness in 2016 Election Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2009, the fact-checking organization PolitiFact, run by the Tampa Bay Times, won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the 2008 election. However, the organization's credibility has come under scrutiny in the 2016 election due to its assessment of Hillary Clinton's truthfulness.\n\nAccording to a recent NBC News poll, only 11 percent of voters described Clinton as \"honest and trustworthy.\" In contrast, PolitiFact's rating for Clinton finds that half of her statements are true or mostly true, 22 percent are half-true, and 26 percent are false or mostly false, with only 2 percent being labeled \"pants-on-fire\" false. Donald Trump, on the other hand, was given a \"pants-on-fire\" rating for 19 percent of his statements.\n\nOne of the areas of contention is Clinton's use of a home-brew server for State Department emails. Clinton has stated that the decision was made for convenience and that it was allowed. However, FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress that thousands of Clinton's work-related emails were not returned, and that no other secretary of state exclusively used a private server. PolitiFact rated Clinton's \"allowed\" assertion as \"false,\" but not \"pants on fire.\"\n\nAnother point of contention is Clinton's linking of an \"awful internet video\" with the Benghazi terrorist attack, which PolitiFact did not rate. In October 2012, on CNN, Clinton blamed the \"fog of war\" for her video remarks. CNN's Jake Tapper, however, determined for FactCheck.org that Clinton contributed to a false impression of the attack despite the State Department and Clinton seeming to know from the beginning that it was a terrorist attack.\n\nPolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan explained that the organization \"purposefully didn't rate statements that we couldn't verify.\" Once the facts became clearer, PolitiFact revised its ratings accordingly. Holan stated that the organization's main goal is to tell its readers what it knows and what it doesn't know.\n\nPolitiFact's assessment of Clinton's truthfulness has also been criticized by other fact-checking organizations. The Washington Post fact-checker gave Bill Clinton three \"Pinocchios\" for his attack on FBI Director James Comey, stating that he made a \"pathetic and misleading attempt to normalize Hillary Clinton's use of her personal email account and play down the fact that she was the only secretary of state to use a private server.\" PolitiFact did not comment on Bill Clinton's attack on Comey.\n\nThe discrepancy between public perception and PolitiFact's assessment of Clinton's truthfulness has led some to question the organization's credibility and impartiality.",
    " Title: U.S. Reaffirms Support for Iraqi Government in Battle Against Islamic State as Tensions Mount\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the Obama administration and the Iraqi government have escalated over the quality of Iraqi security forces, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden reassuring Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi on Monday that the U.S. stands behind the Iraqi government in its fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe White House stated that Mr. Biden's phone conversation with Mr. Al-Abadi aimed to \"reaffirm U.S. support for the Iraqi government\u2019s fight against\" the Islamic State. The conversation followed Defense Secretary Ashton Carter's criticism of the weak state of Iraq's military, which he cited as a major reason for the fall of Ramadi last week.\n\nDefense Secretary Carter stated, \"The Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight. They were not outnumbered. In fact, they vastly outnumbered the opposing force, and yet they failed to fight, they withdrew from the site, and that says to me, and I think to most of us, that we have an issue with the will of the Iraqis to fight [the Islamic State] and defend themselves.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Al-Abadi, Saad al-Hadithi, said on Monday that his government was surprised by Mr. Carter's comments. \"Carter was likely given incorrect information because the situation on the ground is different,\" Mr. al-Hadithi told The Associated Press. \"We should not judge the whole army based on one incident.\"\n\nMr. al-Hadithi attributed the fall of Ramadi to mismanagement and poor planning by some senior military commanders. However, no action has been taken against those commanders, and he did not elaborate.\n\nGeneral Qassim Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds forces in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, offered his own assessment of American forces. In Iran, the daily newspaper Javan, which is seen as close to the Revolutionary Guard, quoted Gen. Soleimani as saying the U.S. did not do \"a damn thing\" to stop the extremists' advance on Ramadi.\n\nGen. Soleimani questioned the U.S.'s commitment, asking, \"Does it mean anything else than being an accomplice in the plot?\" He also stated that Iran and its allies are the only forces that can deal with the threat.\n\nThe war of words over the loss of Ramadi, amid other gains by the Islamic State group in recent days, highlights the fissures among countries that have become allies of convenience against the militants. As Iraqi troops continue to flee their advance, governments across the world are questioning whether relying on Iraqi troops and militiamen on the ground alone will be enough to stop them.\n\nThe White House stated that Mr. Biden \"welcomed\" a decision by Iraq's Council of Ministers last week to mobilize additional troops and prepare for counter-attack operations against the Islamic State. The vice president pledged full U.S. support in these and other Iraqi efforts to liberate territory from ISIL.\n\nU.S. officials, including Mr. Carter, have said Iraqi forces fled the Islamic State advance on Ramadi without fighting back, leaving behind weapons and vehicles for the extremists. President Obama was also critical of Iraq's effort last week, stating that the loss of Ramadi was \"indicative that the training of Iraqi Security Forces, the fortifications, the command-and-control systems are not happening fast enough in Anbar, in the Sunni parts of the country.\"\n\nSo far, the American approach to the conflict has been to launch airstrikes as part of an international coalition it leads, as well as equipping and training Iraqi forces. Iran has offered advisers, including Gen. Soleimani, to direct Shiite militias fighting against the extremists. Iran has said it does not have combat troops fighting in Iraq, though some Revolutionary Guard members have been killed there.\n\nBaghdad has said military preparations are underway to launch a large-scale counteroffensive in Anbar province, home to Ramadi, involving Iranian-backed Shiite militias. However, that possibility has sparked fears of potential sectarian violence in the Sunni province, long the scene of protests and criticism against the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Yet to Vote on Impeachment Inquiry Resolution for President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives has yet to vote on a resolution authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, a procedural move that has sparked debate among political analysts and lawmakers. In a recent podcast, Matt Glassman, an expert on legislative procedure at Georgetown University, stated, \"The Constitution is very clear about impeachment, but it is also not specific.\"\n\nIn the two presidential impeachments of the modern era, the House did have an official vote on a resolution authorizing the impeachment process. This precedent, established during the impeachments of Richard Nixon in 1973 and Bill Clinton in 1998, could make the process appear more serious to voters and Republican officials. However, House rules do not appear to require such a step, and it is not a common practice in impeachments of other officials.\n\nThe impeachment process may be initiated through various actions and events, including the receipt and referral of information from an outside source, investigations by congressional committees under their general authority, or the introduction of articles of impeachment in the form of a House resolution, according to a Congressional Research Service overview of current House impeachment rules.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, who has shown little inclination to hold an impeachment-opening vote, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week, \"If we want to do it, we'll do it. If we don't, we don't.\" Many Republicans argue that without such a vote, the current impeachment process is just a typical House oversight action and does not require extra White House deference in regards to the provision of documents, witness testimony, and other information.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House sent a letter to House Democratic leaders stating it would refuse to participate in the inquiry, charging that it lacks \"any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections.\" Earlier on Tuesday, the White House blocked the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, from speaking with investigators from three House committees. President Trump tweeted that he would \"love\" to have Mr. Sondland testify, but that the process was a \"totally compromised kangaroo court.\"\n\nThere are both political and procedural reasons why Speaker Pelosi might not want to hold an impeachment-opening vote or see it as necessary. Drawing up such a resolution would be difficult and politically risky, as Democrats might find themselves divided over what to include. In addition, House rules have changed, and today the House majority has unilateral subpoena power, removing a big incentive for such a vote. Speaker Pelosi may also be holding an impeachment-inquiry vote in reserve, in case she needs it to convince the courts to force the White House to turn over documents or testimony.\n\nThe White House has its own procedural and political reasons for demanding a vote \u2013 which mirror those of House Democrats. Republicans may want an impeachment vote to provide subpoena power to the House minority, allowing them to carry out a parallel investigation of the actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine, or to call witnesses they feel could debunk charges made against President Trump. In the Nixon and Clinton cases, the kickoff vote did provide such authority to minority members. However, in practice, its impact could be limited, as the actual issuance of subpoenas would likely still be subject to full committee votes in which Democrats would triumph.\n\nThe GOP may also believe it can use this issue to raise doubts about the process in the eyes of voters. Last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California sent Speaker Pelosi a letter calling for impeachment to be put on hold \"until transparent and equitable rules and procedures are established.\" William Howell, a professor of American politics at the University of Chicago, told the Los Angeles Times, \"This is almost entirely about framing the narrative.\"",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Hears Closed-Door Testimony from Intelligence Inspector General\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Thursday, Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, appeared before a closed-door meeting of the House Intelligence Committee. The Committee is set to hold an open hearing next week with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who is also scheduled to brief the Senate Intelligence Committee the following week.\n\nThe nature of the complaint that led to Atkinson's testimony remains unclear, but it is known that the incident involves a principle of Congressional oversight. The complaint, which Maguire has not invoked executive privilege to withhold, is seen by some as a disregard for the plain language of the law.\n\nTwo observations can be made from this situation. First, the intelligence community's watchdog, not a disgruntled deep state actor, found the complaint significant enough to inform Congress. Second, the administration is taking steps to keep the complaint from becoming public, even in confidential hearings.\n\nPresident Trump, in a tweet, questioned the validity of the complaint, stating, \"Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\"\n\nHowever, the President's tweet contradicts his history of concealing details of his conversations with foreign leaders, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and his casual disclosure of Israeli classified intelligence to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the Oval Office. The Defense Secretary also resigned after learning that President Trump had discussed withdrawing American troops from Syria with the Turkish president over the phone.\n\nThree House committees are currently investigating whether President Trump attempted to persuade the Ukrainian government to investigate business dealings of the son of the former vice president and current presidential candidate, Joseph Biden. They have requested a transcript of a July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Urged to Highlight Conservative Influence on Supreme Court Nomination Process\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation hearings for President Trump's Supreme Court nominee have sparked a debate over the nominee's judicial philosophy, constitutional interpretation, and alignment with landmark Supreme Court cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and Griswold v. Connecticut. The article argues that Senate Democrats should use the hearings as an opportunity to educate the public about the influence of conservative legal activists, particularly the Federalist Society, on the federal judiciary and constitutional law.\n\nThe Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization, has been instrumental in shaping President Trump's Supreme Court nominees, as evidenced by the preapproved list of potential nominees during the 2016 campaign. The article suggests that the Federalist Society's supposedly neutral interpretation of the Constitution aligns with Republican policy preferences, potentially leading to changes in laws protecting voting rights, reproductive freedom, and labor unions, among others.\n\nThe article also highlights the global movement against liberal democracy and independent judiciaries, citing examples in Hungary and Poland. It warns that the confirmation of the nominee could lead to a loss of rights and the invalidation of several laws over the next several decades.\n\nThe article concludes by urging Americans who care about the court's future and its role in the American system of government to engage in the political process to restore protections and create an environment where radical judges cannot be nominated or confirmed. The article suggests that long-term organizing is crucial, even in challenging times.",
    " Title: Davos Elites Face Criticism for Climate Change and Economic Inequality Commitments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, is under scrutiny as business leaders and politicians gather to discuss climate change and economic inequality. While the attendees express a commitment to addressing these issues, critics question whether their actions will match their words.\n\nAccording to reports, the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) has recently revised global growth estimates, which could potentially undermine corporate commitments to climate-change initiatives. The WEF, in its support of both President Trump and climate activist Greta Thunberg, is being criticized for attempting to maintain a lower-tax environment while pursuing a climate-friendly agenda.\n\nCritics argue that without a clear distinction between genuine change and empty rhetoric, the WEF will continue to be perceived as a hypocritical exercise. The remaking of capitalism is a delicate process, as it requires companies to prioritize stakeholders beyond shareholders to avoid being outperformed by competitors adhering to traditional rules.\n\nSome argue that the current pace of earnings growth may not be sustainable if companies prioritize stakeholders over shareholders. While efforts to broaden the base of stakeholders may contribute to future growth, the scale of the problems addressed at Davos this week may require more drastic intervention.\n\nThe harsher critics posit that the tension between President Trump and the Davos crowd is not a clash between nationalism and globalism, but rather a disagreement between intellectual fads. Both Trump and the Davos set share the assumption that business leaders and wealthy investors are the most important participants in economic life.\n\nRegarding Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments about Greta Thunberg, critics question why Republican Party policymakers do not heed the advice of economists on climate change. A January 2019 letter signed by thousands of economists, including Nobel laureates and former Federal Reserve chairs, advocated for taxing carbon dioxide emissions as the gold standard of climate policy.\n\nCritics suggest that it would be constructive for Mnuchin and other GOP leaders to listen to economists and advocate for moderately aggressive, market-oriented solutions to the climate problem. However, the current government is doing less than nothing to reduce emissions, despite its public lectures on the need to listen to experts.\n\nLastly, the article discusses the potential for increased conflict in the Middle East following the assassination of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani. President Trump's declaration of a red line regarding American targets or assets may not deter Iran's proxy forces, and influential Republican senators are urged to remind Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and prevent further escalation with Iran.",
    " Title: Political Media's History of Biased Debate Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the autumn season marks the start of election year, the political media and partisans are gearing up for their quadrennial fall classic: the presidential debates. However, the media's history of assessing the first presidential debate has often been marked by a confusion between style and substance.\n\nIn 2008, for instance, Mark Halperin criticized John McCain's performance in the first debate as \"Cluttered, jumpy, and often muddled,\" while giving him a surprisingly high grade of \"B-.\" In contrast, Halperin characterized Senator Obama as \"Polished, confident, focused,\" while being \"immersed in the past, present, and future details of policy.\" Despite this, Obama only received an \"A-\" grade from Halperin.\n\nThe 2012 debate saw more of the same kind of misjudgment. President Obama was deemed detailed, patient, and reserved, while Mitt Romney was described as petulant, aggressive, and a liar. Eleanor Clift noted that Romney won on style and debating points, but Obama \"stuck more closely to the facts.\" However, this truthful assessment didn't score the ratings and clicks the national media needed, leading them to drive the narrative of Romney's win into the history books.\n\nAs the upcoming Clinton-Trump debate approaches, many pundits and political zealots are already planning to grade Donald Trump's performance on a severe curve, while setting the bar for Hillary Clinton's victory much higher. Trump and his surrogates have already been \"working the refs,\" warning debate moderator Lester Holt and the nation that Trump won't be held to real-time fact checks.\n\nIt is essential for the media to apply the same set of rules to both candidates, regardless of their previous experience. Both Clinton and Trump are selling their life experiences as equal reasons to think they're qualified to be president. Any member of the media who tries to grade either on a curve is exposing themselves as a biased referee, who should simply be ignored.\n\nIn politics, as in sports, there are rules for competing fairly. Each candidate must follow those rules honestly, avoid provable lies (sorry spin doctors), obey the clock, make their points with style, but more importantly, with substance. Being president isn't just about playing to a crowd or a camera. Finally, no matter who wins the debate, being the President of the United States is not a game.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Signals Interest in 2020 Presidential Run, According to Sources\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a private meeting with Al Hubbard, a top economic advisor from the Bush administration, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence reportedly expressed interest in being prepared for a potential presidential run in 2020, according to two sources briefed on the conversation. However, Vice President Pence himself has not made any overt efforts to separate himself from President Trump, maintaining public praise and private allegiance.\n\nMarty Obst, an aide to Vice President Pence, denied any private insinuations of positioning himself for a 2020 run and called such suggestions \"beyond ridiculous.\" Meanwhile, Mr. Ayers, who has signaled to multiple major Republican donors that Mr. Pence wants to be ready, declined to comment when reached on the phone.\n\nVice President Pence is reportedly taking steps to establish his own identity and build relationships that could benefit him in the future. In June, he spoke at Senator Joni Ernst's annual pig roast, a significant event for Iowa Republicans, and held a separate, more intimate gathering for donors afterward. Upon arriving in Des Moines on Air Force Two, Mr. Pence was greeted by an Iowan who had expressed dissatisfaction with the Affordable Care Act, who also happened to be a member of the state Republican central committee.\n\nFurthermore, the vice president has used his residence at the Naval Observatory as a hub for relationship building. In June, he opened the mansion to social conservative activists like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council and representatives of the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The vice president's actions suggest a calculated effort to position himself for potential future political endeavors, although he has not made any official announcements regarding his plans for 2020.",
    " Title: White House and Congress Remain at Impasse on Student Loan Issue as Obama Visits University of Nevada, Las Vegas\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama visited the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on Thursday to call on Congress to act on the issue of student loans, as the deadline for interest rates on federally subsidized Stafford loans to double on July 1 approaches. The President has been advocating for a solution to this issue for over a month.\n\nDuring his speech, Obama urged students to pressure Congress to prevent the interest rate increase, stating, \"The clock is running out. Some of these folks in Congress are a little stubborn. You've got to tell Congress, 'Don't double my rate.' I need you to stand up.\"\n\nHowever, Republican leaders in Congress have reportedly sent several proposals to the White House on May 31 to pay for the $6 billion cost of subsidizing student loans. Since then, administration officials have been largely ignoring these offers.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, commented on the situation, stating, \"The president has yet to respond. One can only surmise that he's delaying a solution so that he can fit in a few more campaign rallies with college students while pretending someone other than himself is delaying action.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney stated that the administration is working with Congress, but he noted that Republican leaders have resisted solutions prior to sending the letter last week.\n\nIn addition to the student-loan issue, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, offered GOP leaders a \"bipartisan\" proposal to resolve the student-loan issue. The proposal includes changing the formula by which employers calculate their pension liabilities and increasing employers' premiums for insurance provided by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\nThe speech on student loans at UNLV was the only \"official business\" on Obama's two-day trip aboard Air Force One, along with five campaign fundraisers in California that netted him well over $5 million. Mixing business with campaigning allows the president to split the cost of the trip between his campaign and the taxpayers, rather than having his campaign fund pay for the entire trip.\n\nRepublicans have criticized Obama for using the student-loan deadline to curry favor with young voters, whom he needs to energize for the November election.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the president is more interested in campaigning for the students at UNLV then actually working with Congress to find a solution,\" McConnell said. \"Mr. President, open your mail. The solution's right in front of you. The only people dragging their feet on this issue are over at the White House\u2014dragging their feet to fit in yet another college visit.\"\n\nObama held his fifth fundraiser of this trip Thursday morning at the Los Angeles-area home of Chuck Quarles, a real-estate developer. Air Force One costs about $180,000 per flight hour to operate, meaning the cost of the two-day trip is nearly $2 million just to fly the plane. Campaign-finance experts say a president's campaign is expected to reimburse the government for the cost of a first-class commercial airline seat for each person flying on Air Force One to or from a political event.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Governing Trend Emerges in U.S. Politics: Analysis of Virginia and New Jersey Election Results\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's election results in Virginia and New Jersey have highlighted a shift in American politics, as traditional voting patterns seem to have little relevance in the marquee battles. Columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the New York Post, noted that it would be logical for more conservative Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli to outperform Republican Governor Chris Christie in New Jersey during their reelection bids. However, the results of Tuesday's election did not follow this logic.\n\nThe reasons for Cuccinelli's loss are multifaceted. First and foremost, personality played a significant role. Cuccinelli was portrayed as a right-wing Republican, with his positions on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and social issues used extensively against him in ads throughout the growing North Virginia suburbs.\n\nSecond, Cuccinelli was running against the legacy of the Republican Governor Bob McDonnell's administration, which was marred by allegations of corruption and a growing ethics scandal. McDonnell's silence throughout the campaign benefited Cuccinelli initially, but it also left room for Democrats and spending groups to link them with little rebuttal.\n\nThird, Terry McAuliffe benefited from over $35 million in expenditures and substantial fundraising efforts by high-profile Democrats like Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as President Obama himself.\n\nIn contrast, the victors in both races, Governor Chris Christie and Terry McAuliffe, emphasized bipartisan governing. Christie, known for his work with Democrats in the legislature and his collaboration with President Obama on Hurricane Sandy relief, won significant levels of support from Democratic leaning groups.\n\nChristie also navigated the issue of gay marriage effectively. He maintained a principled stand against gay marriage but allowed same-sex marriages to proceed in New Jersey at the 11th hour, limiting the fallout.\n\nMcAuliffe, despite his liabilities, ran as a mainstream centrist Democrat. He used economic issues to present himself as an alternative to the status quo in a state that has experienced increased unemployment and slower than average economic growth.\n\nThe wins for Christie and McAuliffe suggest that Americans are seeking politicians who govern in a bipartisan manner. This is not to say that these politicians are not traditional; they certainly are. However, they have recognized the importance of working across the aisle and the ideological divide in the current political climate. The two candidates who have managed to do this, Chris Christie and Terry McAuliffe, have been successful, and their bipartisan efforts may have been as influential in their wins as any other factors.\n\nThis development, with two bipartisan governors winning their elections, is a positive sign in an overly partisan and polarized America.",
    " Title: Hackers Compromise North Korea's Uriminzokkiri Twitter and Flickr Accounts Amid Rising Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nSeoul, South Korea - Hackers reportedly breached at least two government-run North Korean online platforms on Thursday, as tensions escalate on the Korean Peninsula. The affected sites include the North's Uriminzokkiri Twitter and Flickr accounts, which ceased posting content typical of the regime in Pyongyang, such as photos of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un with military officials.\n\nAn unusual image posted on the North's Flickr site depicts Kim's face with a pig-like snout and a drawing of Mickey Mouse on his chest. Beneath the image, the text reads, \"Threatening world peace with ICBMs and Nuclear weapons/Wasting money while his people starve to death.\" Another posting reads, \"We are Anonymous,\" a name associated with a hacker activist group. A widely circulated statement, attributed to the attackers, claims the compromise of 15,000 user records hosted on Uriminzokkiri.com and other websites. The authenticity of the statement could not be confirmed, as the North's official website did not open on Thursday.\n\nTweets on the North's Twitter account indicated \"Hacked\" followed by links to North Korea-related websites. One tweet read \"Tango Down\" followed by a link to the North's Flickr page.\n\nNorth Korea established its Twitter account in 2010 and has over 13,000 followers. The North uses social media to praise its system and leaders and to repeat commentaries sent out by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.\n\nTensions have been high in recent days between North and South Korea, and the North's military warned on Thursday that it had been authorized to attack the U.S. North Korea is reportedly upset about sanctions against its nuclear program and joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea.",
    " Title: House to Vote on $1.1 Trillion Spending Bill, Ending Government Funding Impasse\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives is expected to vote on a $1.1 trillion spending bill on Wednesday, aiming to fund the federal government through October and potentially ending the ongoing partisan disputes that led to a government shutdown and the threat of default.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the GOP-led House is scheduled to pass the 1,582-page bill on Wednesday, although many Tea Party conservatives are expected to oppose it. A Senate vote is anticipated by the end of the week, with the Democratic-led chamber also expected to pass the plan.\n\nAs reported by NPR's Ailsa Chang to the Newscast Desk, the bill details the broad outlines agreed upon in last month's budget agreement on Capitol Hill. The budget authorizes spending for nearly every aspect of government within the parameters of last month's budget agreement.\n\nOne significant difference between this bill and the December deal involves cuts to military pensions. The budget agreement announced last month reduced the annual cost-of-living increases for military retirees under 62 by one percent. This spending plan reverses that cut, but only for disabled veterans and relatives of deceased military members.\n\nThe measure eases across-the-board spending cuts by providing an extra $45 billion for military and domestic discretionary programs for fiscal 2014, totaling $1.012 trillion. It also provides an additional $85.2 billion for Afghanistan war funding, which is typically handled off-budget.\n\nBloomberg News reports that the funding will run through January 15, and lawmakers plan to pass a separate three-day stopgap bill at current funding levels to extend the deadline to January 18. This would give lawmakers enough time to enact the comprehensive legislation without risking a government shutdown. The House plans to vote on the three-day measure on the same day.\n\nRegarding the political implications, The Hill states that:\n\n1. The bill includes a provision that would allow the Senate to bypass the filibuster for certain nominations, a move that could make it easier for President Biden to fill vacancies in his administration.\n2. The bill includes a provision that would allow the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement net neutrality rules, a move that could face legal challenges.\n3. The bill includes a provision that would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing new regulations on banks with assets under $10 billion, a move that could face pushback from Democrats.\n4. The bill includes a provision that would prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from issuing new regulations on workplace safety, a move that could face pushback from labor unions.\n5. The bill includes a provision that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from issuing new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, a move that could face pushback from environmental groups.",
    " Title: Portugal's Decriminalization of Drugs Reduces Overdose Deaths, Study Shows\n\nArticle:\n\nA neuroscientist, Carl Hart, former chair of Columbia University's Psychology department, has advocated for the end of the war on drugs, citing its negative impact on society and the ineffectiveness of the policy in reducing drug use. In his new video and upcoming book, Hart argues that the war on drugs has led to increased conflict between law enforcement and citizens, higher incarceration rates, and the formation of violent drug gangs.\n\nHart, who grew up in a tough Miami neighborhood, initially believed that drug use caused significant harm. However, after 20 years of research, he concluded that the evidence did not support this hypothesis. He argues that the illegal status of drugs leads to increased profits, which in turn leads to violence and the formation of gangs.\n\nOne of Hart's concerns is the opioid epidemic. He suggests that the tight restrictions on opioid sales contribute to the high number of overdose deaths. If drugs were over-the-counter, he argues, there would be fewer deaths due to tainted drugs.\n\nHart also points to Portugal as an example of a country that has decriminalized all drug use and offers medical help instead of punishment. In 2001, Portugal decriminalized drug use, and deaths from overdoses dropped sharply. In 2017, Portugal had only 4 deaths per million people, while the United States had 217 per million.\n\nHart argues that the war on drugs disproportionately affects black citizens and that a more permissive drug regime would lead to better outcomes in all areas. He believes that the war on drugs funds a prison-industrial complex and that research not in support of the \"tough-on-drugs\" ideology is routinely dismissed to maintain funding and public outrage.\n\nIn conclusion, Hart's research suggests that the war on drugs does more harm than drugs themselves and that decriminalization, as demonstrated in Portugal, can lead to a reduction in overdose deaths. He argues that society should not punish all citizens because of the actions of a few who cannot handle drug use.",
    " Title: The Cost-Effectiveness of Cracking Down on Visa Overstays and Employer Compliance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe federal government has significantly increased border security measures since 2005, including the addition of hundreds of miles of walls and fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, a doubling of the Border Patrol, and rapid spending increases that have led to duplicative programs. President Trump's proposed border wall has been met with skepticism, as it is seen as a potential multibillion-dollar boondoggle.\n\nThe surge in spending on border enforcement has already reached a point of diminishing return, with the federal government spending more on immigration policing than on all other law enforcement activities combined. Most of California, Arizona, and New Mexico already have some kind of barrier, while Texas faces challenges due to the difficulties of building along the Rio Grande River and private land ownership.\n\nSince 2007, the estimated number of undocumented immigrants has dropped from 12.2 million to slightly over 11 million. While illegal immigration has not ceased entirely, it is being offset by people returning to their home countries. An estimated 35% to 50% of the inflow is people who come in legally and overstay their visas, individuals not impacted by walls or other border control efforts.\n\nGiven these factors, the proposed border wall is considered a colossal waste of money. The idea of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall has led to the cancellation of a scheduled meeting between President Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. A proposed 20% tax on imports from Mexico to recoup construction costs would potentially ignite a mutually destructive trade war, effectively making U.S. consumers bear the costs.\n\nCracking down on visa overstays and on employers who hire illegal workers is seen as a more effective means of improving immigration enforcement than spending an additional $12 billion or more on a border wall.",
    " Title: Minneapolis City Council Pledges to Replace Police Department with \"Public Safety\" System\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Minneapolis city council has announced its intention to disband the city's police force and replace it with an alternative system of \"public safety.\" This decision comes in response to the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in late May.\n\nThe city council's decision follows a series of largely peaceful protests across the United States and around the world, sparked by Floyd's death. Over 10,000 protesters have been arrested during the weeks of unrest, many for non-violent offenses.\n\nThe Obama administration introduced measures to hold police forces accountable after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. However, the Trump administration's Department of Justice has allowed these incremental efforts to wither, which may explain the growing support for a more radical solution: \"defund the police.\"\n\nThe city council's decision to disband the police force and replace it with a public safety system is a dramatic step towards reform. The specifics of the new system have not yet been announced.\n\nIn addition to the Minneapolis city council's decision, protests have spread to cities as far afield as Nigeria and Australia. The novelist Ben Okri suggests Floyd's case has caused worldwide reverberations because his words \"I can't breathe\" speak eloquently both to our fears of the coronavirus pandemic and to the implacable nature of institutional racism.\n\nThe unrest in the United States has also sparked a debate about the role of police forces and the need for reform. Some argue that the police are acting like occupying armies, while others argue that they are necessary for public safety. The debate is ongoing, and the future of policing in the United States remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Violence Erupts During Peaceful Ukrainian Unity March in Donetsk\n\nArticle:\n\nA peaceful march advocating for Ukrainian unity in the eastern city of Donetsk was disrupted by pro-Russian separatists, resulting in explosive fireworks, chaos, and physical altercations on the city's main boulevard. The demonstrators, who were waving the sky blue and gold flags of Ukraine and singing patriotic songs, had only walked about half a mile before they were attacked by a mob of masked men carrying clubs.\n\nThe violence began as a large group of these men, who appeared to be pro-Russian separatists, ran out of side streets and attempted to block the road ahead of the marchers. Fireworks and homemade bombs were thrown from the crowd, with separatists responding by throwing stones and beating people with their weapons. Riot police, who had been trailing along beside the marchers, swiftly moved in, clashing with the attackers and trying to separate both sides.\n\nOne member of the mob was seen getting hit in the head with an exploding homemade bomb, and a loud bang was heard at the feet of a police officer. Marchers scattered in all directions, with members of the pro-Russian mob chasing them down the street. One man, with a head gash and visible blood, flashed a simple peace sign as he walked off to find help.\n\nIn the midst of the confusion, an ambulance crew was treating the wounded, where a Ukrainian journalist with a bloody bandage on his head was found. He told reporters he was trying to flee when he was hit by a brick. The demonstration had begun peacefully, but pro-Russian separatists had been calling for their supporters to oppose the march on social media for several days.\n\nThree weeks ago, separatist gunmen occupied the main administration building in Donetsk and have since turned it into a heavily fortified command center in their bid to carve out an independent republic with strong ties to neighboring Russia. Donetsk lies at the center of one of Ukraine's volatile breakaway eastern provinces, and, as witnessed today, it is simmering on the verge of all-out civil war.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Officials Face Challenges in Tracking Extremists Amid Differences with European Counterparts\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. intelligence officials are encountering difficulties in monitoring the movements of American and European-born fighters who travel to the Middle East to join Islamic extremist groups like ISIS, due to varying approaches to information sharing and homeland security from their European counterparts, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe report states that U.S. officials are finding it challenging to trace the movements of suspected extremists once they enter certain European countries. This issue arises despite close intelligence links between U.S. and European security services, with intelligence from both sides of the Atlantic bolstering terror watch lists maintained by U.S. officials, such as the no-fly list.\n\nA point of concern among U.S. intelligence officials is a series of anti-terror proposals made last week by British Prime Minister David Cameron, particularly his proposal to revoke the passports of British nationals who have traveled to fight for ISIS. U.S. counter-terrorism officials reportedly view this move with apprehension, as confiscating passports could prevent individuals who have traveled to Syria and Iraq from communicating with authorities and providing intelligence about the situation there.\n\nA report in The Times of London last week suggested that up to 30 British-born ISIS fighters have grown disillusioned with the militants' brutal tactics and wish to return home, but are hesitant due to the punitive measures advocated by Cameron.\n\nPresident Obama is set to meet with congressional leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss his plan to combat the ISIS threat. Few details of Obama's plan have been disclosed ahead of a scheduled Wednesday address to the nation, though the New York Times reported Monday that the White House is planning a three-phase campaign that some Pentagon officials believe would take at least three years to fully execute.\n\nThe U.S. has already carried out nearly 150 airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, and The Times reported that the final phase of the campaign would involve the extension of airstrikes into Syria, where ISIS has its base.\n\nThe Obama administration is also applying pressure on allies to firmly align behind action against ISIS. Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia and Jordan to meet with Mideast leaders and assess their level of commitment to a growing worldwide coalition. The Associated Press reported that Kerry pressed a core group of 10 countries to form a loose coalition to target last week's NATO summit. Along with the United States, the coalition includes the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Germany, Canada, Turkey, Italy, Poland, and Denmark.\n\nAs he deliberates his next move, Obama is seeking advice from prominent foreign policy experts across the political spectrum over dinner at the White House. Among the guests invited to join Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were former national security advisers from the Obama, George W. Bush, Clinton, and Carter administrations, as well as Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass and former Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell.\n\nIn a call Monday evening, Obama congratulated new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi for the approval of a new government. The White House said al-Abadi \"expressed his commitment to work with all communities in Iraq as well as regional and international partners to strengthen Iraq's capabilities\" to fight the Islamic State militants.\n\nObama also spoke with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on the need to continue addressing the ongoing threat from the Islamic State and to thank Australia for its contributions to humanitarian air drops in northern Iraq, according to the White House.",
    " Title: White House Shifts Focus to Economic Recovery as CDC Releases Guidelines for Reopening Businesses\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released new guidelines for the safe reopening of businesses, schools, churches, and other organizations as states gradually lift their coronavirus restrictions. The recommendations, which are still subject to revision, offer advice on how to reopen various types of entities, including schools, religious facilities, workplaces, and restaurants.\n\nThe CDC has put together \"decision trees\" for at least seven types of organizations: schools, camps, childcare centers, religious facilities, mass transit systems, workplaces, and bars/restaurants. The recommendations were obtained from a federal official who was not authorized to release them publicly.\n\nIn the initial reopening phases, schools should space desks six feet apart, nix any field trips and school assemblies, and have students eat lunch in their classrooms instead of the cafeteria. Churches should hold services through video streaming or at drive-in or outdoor venues as much as possible. They should also encourage everyone to wear cloth face masks, use a stationary collection box, and schedule extra services if necessary to make sure church pews are not packed and congregants stay at least six feet from each other.\n\nRestaurants should consider using throwaway menus, single-service condiments, and disposable forks, knives, spoons, and dishes. They should install sneeze guards at cash registers, limit the number of employees on a shift, and avoid having buffets, salad bars, and drink stations.\n\nThe guidance for religious groups includes providing congregants spiritual and emotional care \"on a flexible or virtual basis or refer them to other available resources.\"\n\nAllen Fagin, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, said that as much as worship in synagogues is \"one of the most fundamental aspects of Jewish life,\" his faith also believes that \"the sanctity of life is more important than any other aspect of observance.\"\n\nThe application of any guidelines is likely to have significant regional and demographic variation, Fagin added. \"There's going to have to be a great deal of both training and soul-searching in particular communities to make certain the guidelines are understood and will in fact be adhered to, to the letter,\" he said.\n\nVarious trade groups have also started coming out with their own recommendations. For example, the National Restaurant Association last week put out guidance to restaurants considering reopening. The association said restaurants should clean and sanitize reusable menus, while the CDC suggests using disposable menus. And the CDC recommends that employees use cloth masks when interacting with customers, but the association doesn't. But some guidance is similar. The association and the CDC both recommend seating dining parties at least 6 feet apart.\n\nLarry Lynch, a senior vice president at the trade group, said the restaurant industry is already heavily regulated in order to prevent foodborne illnesses. So he doesn't think additional guidelines from the CDC are onerous.\n\n\"The fact is we're probably already 80% of the way there with the mandates coming out of the food code,\" he said.\n\nLynch said the biggest concern for restaurant owners isn't federal guidelines, but convincing people that it's safe to return to restaurants.\n\nMany companies, especially those with strong remote work capabilities, are already drawing up plans that go beyond the CDC's guidelines, said Bhushan Sethi, global people and organization leader at PwC, a consulting firm. He said many companies are considering keeping their employees working from home well after authorities lift stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"It's a bare minimum compared to the playbook that many firms are putting in place,\" Sethi said of the CDC guidelines on workplaces. \"Firms are acknowledging that people are going to be fearful.\"\n\nAbout 65% of companies recently surveyed by PwC are planning to reconfigure work sites to allow physical distancing. Some 52% are planning staggered shifts or alternating crews, according to the April 18-22 survey of chief financial officers at 305 U.S. companies.",
    " Title: David Brock Assumes Control of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nDavid Brock, a self-proclaimed former right-wing hitman turned Clinton enforcer, has taken over as chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a leading watchdog group. The move, confirmed by Brock in an interview, marks a significant expansion of his political influence.\n\nUnder Brock's leadership, CREW is set to undergo a transformation, becoming a more politically oriented attack dog organization. The reconfigured CREW will establish a more politically focused arm, expand its focus into state politics, and engage in closer coordination with Brock's fleet of Democrat-backing nonprofits and super PACs, including Media Matters, American Bridge, and the American Independent Institute.\n\nBrock, who founded Media Matters in 2004, described the changes as providing \"potentially powerful tools in the tool box.\" He stated, \"We have been in the accountability for 10 years very successfully. It is kind of a one-stop-shop now.\"\n\nIn addition to the restructured CREW, Brock is also forming a new, overtly partisan watchdog group called The American Democracy Legal Fund. This group, to be run by Brad Woodhouse, president of American Bridge, will operate under section 527 of the Tax Code, allowing it to engage in more political activity than CREW's traditional portfolio.\n\nCREW was founded in 2003 by former federal prosecutor Melanie Sloan and white-collar lawyer Norm Eisen. The group gained a reputation for relentlessly pursuing litigation and ethics complaints against primarily Republican public officials, playing a significant role in the Jack Abramoff scandal and the downfalls of powerful GOP Reps. Tom DeLay and Bob Ney during the Bush administration.\n\nUnder the stewardship of Sloan, who serves as CREW's executive director, the group has maintained a non-partisan approach, pursuing corruption allegations regardless of political affiliation. CREW's annual \"Most Corrupt Members of Congress\" report, which started in 2005, has included 25 Democrats among its 88 featured members. The group has also called for the resignations of embattled New York Democratic Reps. Anthony Weiner and Charlie Rangel, and has pending requests for investigations into the Obama administration.\n\nThe exact details of the new structure and operations of CREW under Brock's leadership are still unfolding. Further information regarding the new executive director and the specifics of the group's expanded focus are yet to be announced.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens Protesters Ahead of Tulsa Rally, Cites Increased Security Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in preparation for his first campaign rally in months in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday, has threatened any protesters who may attempt to disrupt the event, stating that the situation will be \"a much different scene\" compared to how protesters have been handled in cities like New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday morning, Trump wrote, \"Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!\"\n\nThe specifics of Trump's threat and the actions he could take to enforce it remain unclear. However, the president has taken a more hostile stance towards protesters in recent weeks, categorizing \"protesters\" alongside \"anarchists,\" \"looters,\" and \"lowlifes.\"\n\nTrump has previously blamed the antifa movement for violence at protests without providing evidence and has boasted about the National Guard's handling of protesters in Minneapolis, comparing it to a \"knife cutting butter.\"\n\nA curfew was imposed in Tulsa beginning Thursday night and continuing into the weekend, according to Tulsa's mayor, due to concerns about organized groups coming to the city. Mayor G.T. Bynum stated, \"Last night, I enacted a curfew at the request of Tulsa Police Chief Wendell Franklin, following consultation with the United States Secret Service based on intelligence they had received. Today, we were told the curfew is no longer necessary so I am rescinding it.\"\n\nTrump later tweeted, \"I just spoke to the highly respected Mayor of Tulsa, G.T. Bynum, who informed me there will be no curfew tonight or tomorrow for our many supporters attending the #MAGA Rally. Enjoy yourselves - thank you to Mayor Bynum!\"\n\nThe rally was initially scheduled for June 19, known as Juneteenth, the holiday marking when the last enslaved people were informed of their freedom, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. In a rare move, the president, after consulting with two black Secret Service agents, announced last week that he would reschedule the rally for the following day.\n\nTensions in the city are not limited to race, as Oklahoma is still grappling with the coronavirus and has seen a recent increase in cases. The city is also the site of a race massacre in 1921, in which as many as 300 black residents were killed by whites.\n\nConcerns about the rally extend beyond race, as the state is still battling the coronavirus. Trump, in another tweet on Friday, referred to the Tulsa rally as the re-launch of his reelection campaign, stating, \"Big crowds and lines already forming in Tulsa. My campaign hasn\u2019t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!\"\n\nThe rally is expected to draw as many as 100,000 Trump supporters, with some having lined up outside the 19,000-seat Bank of Oklahoma Center in Tulsa days before the rally. Trump claimed this week that over a million people had requested tickets for the event, and his campaign has been exploring possible venues for an overflow crowd.\n\nOklahoma's Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt supported the rally during a meeting with Trump at the White House on Thursday for an unrelated event focused on government assistance for small businesses. Stitt assured the rally would be safe, despite a city health official labeling an event like the rally a \"huge risk factor\" for spreading the coronavirus.\n\nTrump boasted about the demand for tickets to his first rally during the ongoing pandemic and cited the state's handling of the pandemic as one reason his campaign chose Oklahoma. \"We're so excited to have you,\" Stitt told Trump. \"And like you said, I don't know if people caught that but over a million people have requested tickets to come to come to this event so it's just gon na be amazing.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine told ABC News the campaign \"takes the health and safety of rally-goers seriously and is taking precautions to make the rally safe,\" including temperature checks for attendees and providing them with face masks and hand sanitizer.",
    " Title: Criticism of WHO's Response to China's Handling of COVID-19 Pandemic Raises Questions About Organization's Structure and Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has faced criticism from the left for its response to China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, but calls for drastic measures such as cutting its funding during a global health crisis are being met with skepticism.\n\nThe WHO's constant praise for China's response has left many exasperated, with some arguing that the organization has been too lenient towards China due to its status as a major donor and an important backer of its current leader, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the WHO, raising concerns about its handling of the pandemic, but some argue that his approach is misguided. Amanda Glassman, the executive vice-president and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, stated that a deeper problem is the WHO's low budget and relatively toothless structure.\n\nUnlike the International Atomic Energy Agency, the WHO has no redress against governments that do not cooperate. Glassman said, \"It operates in countries at the pleasure and permission of the host country governments. So in the case of China, to be allowed to enter China, it was a negotiation to get there.\"\n\nDisagreements with the WHO should not lead to the US slamming the group or withdrawing support. The global community still needs an authoritative body that sets standards, collates, and studies all of the pieces of the Covid-19 puzzle coming in from affected countries.\n\nEarly on, when the WHO wasn't as harsh on China as it perhaps should have been, it was not getting support from the United States to do anything differently. Global public health expert Stephen Morrison stated that it's important to remember that the WHO is an organization made up of its member states. To forcefully take on one of those members (in this case, China), it needs the backing of the others.\n\nTrump's criticism of the WHO has been inconsistent, as he has repeatedly vouched for China's efforts and transparency in handling the pandemic. Early on, when the WHO wasn't as harsh on China as it perhaps should have been, it was not getting support from the United States to do anything differently.\n\nIn conclusion, the WHO is in need of reform, but at a time when humankind is literally fighting for its life, now is not the wrong time to decapitate the agency leading the global response. If not the WHO, then who?",
    " Title: Potential Pitfalls in Upcoming Republican Immigration Bills: Enforcement, Citizenship, and Visa Reforms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States awaits a Republican-proposed immigration bill, several key issues have emerged that warrant close attention. The potential legislation must address the possibility of immigrants gaining citizenship, enforcement measures, and visa availability.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the citizenship issue. Any legalization plan should allow for the potential of immigrants becoming American citizens. While the principles rule out a \"special\" path to citizenship, they do not exclude the possibility of eventual naturalization for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. The specifics of this process, however, remain unclear at this time.\n\nRepublicans are reportedly demanding \"significant fines\" and other penalties for undocumented immigrants, and the meeting of enforcement benchmarks as a condition for legalization. They also propose mandatory national expansion of the E-Verify hiring database and a new entry-exit visa system. However, new layers of enforcement should not be so onerous as to prevent immigrants from leaving the shadows, and reforms to legal immigration must be expansive enough to ease crushing backlogs that discourage potential immigrants.\n\nIncreased powers for states and localities to enforce immigration laws, potentially leading to racial profiling and other abuses, have no place in any bill.\n\nAs we wait for a bill, deportations continue. The Obama administration has expelled nearly two million people, breaking up thousands of families that President Obama has repeatedly promised to protect. If Congress fails to pass comprehensive immigration reform, will the President protect these individuals through his own administrative action, as he already has by deferring deportations for a relative handful of unauthorized youths?\n\nThe road to comprehensive immigration reform has been long and fraught with obstacles. The hopeful days of bipartisan Senate legislation in 2013, eventually killed by a Republican filibuster, are a distant memory. Now, as Republicans, traditionally advocates of self-deportation and Arizona-style laws, may be edging closer to saying yes to legal status for millions of the undocumented, the question remains: Are they serious, and will any bills get past the party's \"hell no\" caucus? It will soon become clear whether this is the first step back toward the rational, humane reform that should have passed years ago.",
    " Title: House Approves One-Week Extension for DHS Funding, Long-Term Bill Remains Unresolved\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives approved a one-week extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday, following a day of intense negotiations. President Obama signed the bill later that day. The passage of the one-week extension came after a longer three-week stopgap was rejected in the House.\n\nThe contentious issue that has delayed a longer-term funding bill, the inclusion of a push-back on President Obama's executive action on immigration, remains unresolved. The fresh deadline to resolve the impasse is approaching.\n\nAccording to NPR's Ailsa Chang, speaking on Weekend Edition Saturday, the lack of coordination between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner created tension between the two chambers. Many House Republicans resented being pressured by the Senate to pass a long-term funding bill, which is one reason they pushed back with a shorter-term bill.\n\nRepublicans anticipate that next week, the House will likely align with the Senate's bill, funding DHS through September without immigration changes. \"I don't think there's any alternative,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA). \"When we're at the end of next week, what do we do?\"\n\nAn aide to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) stated that the Republican leader had made no commitment, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) expressed expectation that the one-week measure would provide the necessary time to pass a funding measure covering the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nBoehner's allies are concerned that his critics within the Republican Conference may attempt to oust him as speaker if, as expected, he puts a long-term DHS funding bill on the House floor next week. While Boehner dismisses such speculation, close friends believe such a move is a real possibility.\n\nTwenty-five Republicans voted against Boehner for speaker on the floor in early January, signaling his continued problems with his conservative hardliners. Boehner's allies believe that the DHS debacle on Friday, when 52 Republicans voted against the three-week plan, was in part aimed at toppling the speaker.\n\nChang notes that Boehner has a vocal and determined contingent of conservatives in his caucus who are not afraid to challenge him, and this group is larger now than before the election. More than 50 Republicans voted against Boehner's first plan on Friday.",
    " Title: Democrats Express Concern Over Hillary Clinton's Public Remarks on 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats, including staunch supporters and former aides of Hillary Clinton, have expressed concern over the former Secretary of State's public remarks regarding her loss in the 2016 presidential election. Many Democrats believe that her continued criticism of the Democratic National Committee and her handling of the election are hurting the party and making her appear bitter.\n\nIn interviews with over a dozen Democrats, they acknowledged the need for Clinton to explain her election loss and empathized with her anger over the FBI's investigation into her private email server. However, they unanimously agreed that Clinton needs to rethink her public blaming tour.\n\nOne longtime aide questioned Clinton's strategy, stating, \"Good God, what is she doing? She's apparently still really, really angry. The election was stolen from her, and that's how she feels. But to go out there publicly again and again and talk about it? And then blame the DNC?\"\n\nFormer Obama aides are also puzzled by Clinton's strategy. At the Recode conference, Clinton stated that she had inherited nothing from a \"bankrupt\" Democratic Party led by Obama for eight years. A former senior aide to Obama commented, \"If she is trying to come across as the leader of the angry movement of what happened in 2016, then she's achieving it. But part of the problem she had was she didn't have a vision for the Democratic Party, and she needs to now take a break and let others come to the forefront.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently feeling somewhat leaderless after the eight years of Obama and the surprise Clinton defeat. President Obama has largely gone out of public view, though he reappeared this week with a statement criticizing President Trump for pulling the United States from the Paris climate deal. Advisers to Obama have said he wants to give a new generation of leaders room to grow.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders is perhaps the leading figure on the left after he gave Clinton a run for her money in the 2016 primary. However, he is not even a member of the Democratic Party. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is still adjusting to his leadership position after winning his post in a contest with Rep. Keith Ellison. The two have worked hard to forge a united front since the election.\n\nThe former Obama aide stated that Clinton's criticisms of the DNC can make it tougher for new leaders to come forward. \"It's hard to do that when you have the former nominee out there in a newsy, aggressive manner,\" the aide said.\n\nWhile Obama has made public appearances since leaving office, he has generally refrained from talking about Trump. Instead, he has held events focused on getting young adults active in civic engagement. This puts Obama in the tradition of other past presidents who have generally sought to avoid public criticisms of their immediate successors. Whether Obama will continue to avoid public criticisms of Trump is unclear.\n\nLongtime aides and advisers say Clinton will not run for public office again and that she feels liberated to finally speak her mind. They anticipate that Clinton will keep discussing the election, particularly to promote her upcoming book, which is expected to be published this fall.\n\n\"She's saying the same stuff she would say on a phone call with me,\" said one former aide who worked on the 2016 campaign. \"And I think she'll continue to have a national dialogue on what needs to be fixed.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist Brad Bannon stated, \"I'm not sure there is a political strategy here. It sounds to me like more of a personal strategy.\" Bannon added, \"Complaining about an outcome and blaming everyone else is not a good political strategy.\"\n\nJamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist, acknowledged some frustration among Democrats over Clinton's remarks. \"Some people I know are just frustrated that it's happening,\" he said. \"She is a national hero and a great public servant and has the right to be upset.\"\n\nSimmons added that if she's going to discuss the loss, \"it would be nice to hear a little more about the things she did wrong, which I believe mattered more than what she has discussed.\" Simmons, who worked for Al Gore, stated, \"When Al Gore lost the election, he went to Europe, gained weight, and grew a beard. He walked away. And there's something to that.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Urges West Virginia Voters to Oppose Don Blankenship in Senate Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, President Donald Trump urged Republican primary voters in West Virginia to oppose former coal baron Don Blankenship in the upcoming Senate primary. Trump instead endorsed two of his rivals, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins.\n\n\"To the great people of West Virginia, we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can\u2019t win the General Election in your State... No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe president's tweet comes ahead of Tuesday's primary in West Virginia, aiming to prevent a loss in the general election against Senator Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in November.\n\nAttorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins have intensified their attacks on Blankenship, who is a former coal industry executive serving a year in prison for conspiring to violate mine safety laws in connection with the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion in West Virginia in 2010 that killed 29 workers. Blankenship's parole is set to end on Wednesday, the day after West Virginians cast their ballots.\n\nOver the weekend, Morrisey announced plans to have Blankenship disqualified from the race for failing to submit a financial disclosure, a violation of election law. \"My campaign will be informing his probation officer in Nevada about this issue right away, to determine if this refusal to comply with federal law violates the terms of his supervised release,\" Morrisey said.\n\nBlankenship's campaign stated that if he wins the primary, it will release paperwork detailing his finances the following week. Blankenship also responded to Trump's tweet, expressing confidence that \"we\u2019re still going to win\" and stating that the president must not understand West Virginia politics.\n\n\"Neither of my opponents can beat Joe Manchin without my support, but I will beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment,\" Blankenship vowed. \"... Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message\u2014no one, and I mean no one, will tell us how to vote. As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump, and this morning proves it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Morrisey has started using \"robo-calls\" to potential voters, stating, \"Convicted criminal Don Blankenship didn\u2019t vote for President Trump and is a resident of Nevada, where he must report to his parole officer.\"\n\nBlankenship has campaigned as an outsider against the Washington establishment. However, top Republicans see similarities to GOP candidate Roy Moore, who lost the Alabama special election race amid allegations of sexual misconduct, ultimately flipping the seat blue for the first time in decades.\n\nBlankenship has also been accused of running racially charged ads in recent weeks. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., came out against Blankenship just days ago, citing the Moore example.\n\n\"I hate to lose. So I\u2019m gon na go out on a limb here and ask the people of West Virginia to make a wise decision and reject Blankenship! No more fumbles like Alabama. We need to win in November. # wv # wvpol,\" Trump Jr. tweeted.\n\nBlankenship has also taken direct aim at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., another move from Moore's playbook. The candidate has called McConnell \"Cocaine Mitch\" and attempted to link the leader to a 2014 report about drugs purportedly found on a ship owned by his in-laws.\n\nBlankenship has accused McConnell of creating jobs for \"Chinapeople\" and said his \"China family\" has given him millions of dollars. McConnell's wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, was born in Taiwan. Her father, entrepreneur and philanthropist James S.C. Chao, was born in China.\n\nIn addition to West Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Indiana will hold primary elections on Tuesday ahead of the midterms. Trump won each of the four states in the 2016 presidential race.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Establishes Right to Unanimous Jury Verdicts in State and Federal Trials\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision on Monday, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 6-3, overturned a previous ruling that the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee a right to a unanimous jury in state trials. The ruling, which was a reversal of a 1972 decision, will now apply to both federal and state courts.\n\nThe ruling overturned the conviction of Evangelisto Ramos, who is serving a life sentence in Louisiana for a 2016 murder conviction following a jury vote of 10-2. The court's decision is significant as it continues a trend in which the court has held that protections in the Bill of Rights that originally applied only to the federal government also apply to actions by state governments.\n\nThe court's ruling is important because it establishes that most of the significant protections of the Bill of Rights\u2014the ones dealing with personal liberty\u2014do apply to the states. This is not just a legal nicety. At a time when the relationship between the states and the federal government is being newly debated, it's important that there is no daylight between the two when it comes to fundamental rights. Where basic rights are concerned, this must be one country.\n\nLouisiana and Oregon, which have long since renounced the racist underpinnings of their non-unanimity rule, nonetheless retained it on less noxious but still ill-conceived reasoning. The theory that non-unanimity discourages hung juries, which waste resources, since cases then have to be retried, has been criticized for ignoring that a unanimous jury is a fundamental right and for proceeding on two faulty assumptions: (1) Hung juries are worse than wrongful convictions or acquittals, and (2) permitting non-unanimous verdicts makes hung juries less likely\u2014to the contrary; it undermines the spirit of open-minded deliberation that encourages juries to arrive at a consensus.\n\nA 2018 report from the New Orleans Advocate validated what many had long suspected: that split-decision verdicts were particularly harmful in cases where the defendant was black, or when black people served on majority white juries. According to the paper's research, black defendants in Louisiana were 30 percent more likely to be convicted by a split jury decision. When jurors don't have to agree on a decision, jury members with strong dissenting opinions are effectively silenced. The Advocate found that in some parishes, this happened more frequently to black jurors.\n\nJustice Alito pointed out in Monday's dissenting opinion that Louisiana and Oregon now face 'a potential tsunami of litigation' as defendants seek new trials for convictions that weren't decided unanimously. However, this crush of appeals signifies something valuable\u2014it's proof of the necessity of today's ruling. The sheer fact there could be so many people denied a fair and just trial is exactly what made today's majority opinion so important, and for too many, so overdue.",
    " Title: President Obama to Discuss Counterterrorism Strategies Amidst Increased Fears of Terrorism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to alleviate concerns regarding terrorism, President Obama will spend a significant portion of the coming week discussing his strategies for combatting the Islamic State (IS) militant group both domestically and internationally. The president has adopted a more reassuring tone in response to terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, urging Americans not to succumb to distrust and fear.\n\n\"Terrorists like ISIL are trying to divide us along lines of religion and background,\" Obama stated in his weekly address on Sunday, using an acronym for the extremist group. \"That's how they stoke fear. That's how they recruit.\"\n\nHowever, for an increasing number of Americans, these fears are becoming increasingly real, following terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. A recent poll found that 5 in 10 Americans believed the risk of a terrorist attack in the United States was high. A new survey reveals that this number has increased to 7 in 10, despite attempts by the government to assure citizens that there are no credible threats to the US.\n\nIn an effort to publicize the government's counterterrorism efforts, the president has scheduled a series of high-profile visits to the Pentagon and the National Counterterrorism Center this week, before leaving Washington for his annual two-week family holiday in Hawaii.\n\nThe Dec. 2 mass shooting in San Bernardino has raised concerns about the US government's ability to identify lone-wolf radicals who may have been inspired by Islamic State. The US government has been successful in intercepting would-be terrorists who have been in contact with terrorist recruiters online, but the fact that the shooters in the San Bernardino attacks managed to remain under the government's radar until they killed 14 people at a health department holiday party has fueled fears that the government may not be doing enough.\n\nThe recruitment strategies employed by IS, including an online approach that focuses on inspiring lone attacks, have forced US intelligence officials to engage in a war on multiple fronts, from the Middle East to social media.\n\nObama will begin the week with a National Security Council meeting at the Pentagon, followed by a public update about the US strategy against Islamic State. On Thursday, Obama will visit the National Counterterrorism Center, which analyzes intelligence to stay abreast of recruiting methods and other information on terrorist groups. Obama is scheduled to address reporters after a briefing at the suburban Virginia facility.\n\nThe visits are seen as counterweights to the increased fear over terror attacks in the public and in the widely-viewed presidential election campaigns. Previously, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the US, a suggestion that the president has alluded to in public comments urging Americans to remain united.\n\n\"We cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam,\" Obama said on Sunday.",
    " Title: Clinton Accuses Sanders of Seeking to Abolish Obamacare Through Single-Payer Healthcare Proposal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has accused her primary rival, Bernie Sanders, of aiming to abolish the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) through his proposal for a single-payer healthcare system. The attack stems from a bill Sanders introduced in the Senate in 2013, which would have established national single-payer healthcare with state-run programs overseen by a federal board.\n\nSanders' bill, in some ways, mirrors Obamacare, allowing each state the option to set up a marketplace exchange for insurance plans, with the federal government operating a large exchange for states that opt out. The bill would have folded federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP into these state-run programs.\n\nHowever, Clinton's specific accusation that Sanders' single-payer plan would allow states to opt out entirely is questionable, as it contradicts the progressive nature of the proposal. The Clinton campaign has aggressively pursued this attack throughout the week, with Chelsea Clinton, who is not typically an attack dog, criticizing Sanders' plan for potentially stripping millions of people of their health insurance.\n\nThe debate between Clinton and Sanders over healthcare proposals is a contentious issue within the Democratic party, with some suggesting that it could lead to a sharpening of the general Democratic healthcare platform before the general election. Some have also proposed the possibility of Sanders and Clinton uniting to push for a public option, a proposal that was taken off the table during the drafting of the ACA in 2009, damaging the progressive credibility of the law in some circles.\n\nRegardless of the specific healthcare proposals, it is unlikely that any will pass through the Congress that the next president will be saddled with. The major barrier to enacting single-payer or adding a public option to the ACA remains Congress and the army of industry lobbyists who will descend on it when the insurance companies perceive their bottom lines to be in jeopardy. Additionally, the House of Representatives is likely to remain under Republican control after November, and these Republicans are expected to continue their obstructionist tactics.\n\nEven if the House flips to the Democrats, a president would still have to contend with the Senate, where the Democratic majority is not guaranteed. The Senate, like the House, is a complex and often unpredictable body, with a history of bipartisan cooperation and obstruction.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate between Clinton and Sanders over healthcare proposals is a valuable discussion for the Democratic party, as it sharpens the party's platform and highlights the challenges of enacting progressive healthcare reform. However, it is essential to remember that the major barrier to enacting single-payer or adding a public option to the ACA remains Congress and the powerful lobbying forces that oppose such reforms.",
    " Title: Texas Authorities to Seek Adult Court for Ethan Couch, Missing Teen Involved in Fatal Drunk-Driving Accident\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas authorities have announced their intention to seek adult prison for Ethan Couch, the teenager who used the \"affluenza\" defense in a juvenile court case for a drunk-driving accident that resulted in the deaths of four people in 2013. Couch was taken into custody in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Monday, nearly two weeks after he failed to appear for a probation appointment.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, authorities outlined potential legal options for the state to pursue. Couch is scheduled for a court hearing on January 19, where the district attorney will motion to move the juvenile case to adult court. The juvenile judge will make the final decision on the case's location.\n\nCouch and his mother, Tonya Couch, were located and arrested by Mexican authorities on a road in Puerto Vallarta. Couch, who was previously known for his blond hair, had brown hair during the arrest, but authorities were able to make a positive identification.\n\nAuthorities believe the two planned their escape, with Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson stating, \"They even had something that was almost akin to a going-away party before leaving town.\"\n\nAn arrest warrant will be issued for Tonya Couch on charges of hindering an apprehension. Prosecutors plan to ask a judge to transfer Ethan Couch's case to adult court during a hearing next month.\n\nCouch's attorneys, Scott Brown and Reagan Wynn, have stated they will not comment on the case until they speak with their client, which is unlikely to happen before Couch returns to the United States. The two are currently being held at immigration offices in the state capital, Guadalajara, and are expected to return to the United States aboard a commercial flight to Houston on Tuesday.\n\nMexico's Jalisco state prosecutors' office stated its agents had been working with American authorities since December 26 to track down and capture Couch and his mother. They were found in a less affluent section of Puerto Vallarta's old town, far from the city's glitzy resorts, golf courses, and high-rise hotels.\n\nCouch was apparently trying to lie low; a photo distributed by the Jalisco state prosecutor's office shows him in detention with his blond hair dyed black and his normally blondish beard a light brown.\n\nTarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson believes the two fled in late November after a video surfaced that appears to show Couch at a party where people were drinking. If found to be drinking, Couch's probation could be revoked, and he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.\n\nCouch was driving drunk and speeding on a dark two-lane road south of Fort Worth in June 2013 when he crashed into a disabled SUV off to the side, killing four people and injuring several others, including passengers in Couch's pickup truck.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury. Because of his age, he was not certified as an adult for trial, and a judge sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years' probation and a stint in a rehabilitation center.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service had issued a wanted poster promising a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to Ethan Couch's whereabouts and capture.",
    " Title: McAuliffe's Campaign Focused on Virginia, Not the Clintons, Despite Clinton Associates' Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nTerry McAuliffe's 2013 gubernatorial campaign in Virginia is attracting attention as a potential testing ground for Hillary Clinton's political influence, according to several donors and operatives. McAuliffe, a close associate of the Clintons, has stocked his campaign with top-tier talent likely to be involved in any potential Hillary Clinton presidential effort.\n\nNotably, McAuliffe's campaign has raised nearly $2 million in March alone at a half-dozen out-of-state fundraisers featuring former President Bill Clinton or other Clinton insiders. Robby Mook, Patrick Hallahan, Jonathan Mantz, and Jackson Dunn are among the key figures in McAuliffe's campaign team.\n\nThe success or failure of McAuliffe's campaign serves as a measure of Clinton's strength and organization in a critical swing state, as Virginia now rivals Ohio in its significance for winning a presidential election. However, McAuliffe's campaign and its surrogates have officially discouraged the perception that it is a Clinton farm team.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Clinton has endorsed McAuliffe's fundraising pitches, with Clinton herself leaving campaigning and fundraising to her husband. Discussions of 2016 could potentially complicate McAuliffe's message in his tight race against Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli.\n\nMcAuliffe has sought to portray himself as a moderate Virginia businessman rather than a Washington insider, despite his close ties to the Clintons. James Carville, a longtime political strategist and Clinton loyalist, stated that McAuliffe and his team have not pitched his campaign as a Clinton effort-in-waiting. Carville, who hosted a fundraiser for McAuliffe last month, emphasized that McAuliffe has his own political base.\n\nAnother McAuliffe fundraiser in Georgetown last month raised $170,000 from a group of longtime allies and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s that resembled a Clinton kitchen cabinet-in-waiting. The event, held at Harold Ickes' Washington home, was co-hosted by Ickes, Dick Gephardt, and their lobbying partners, as well as Jonathan Mantz and other Clinton loyalists. The invitation described McAuliffe as \"a mentor to all of us...now it is time to elect him governor.\"",
    " Title: BD Medical Technology Company Shifts Manufacturing to Mexico Due to U.S. Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nBD, a medical technology company, announced last month that it was relocating some of its manufacturing from China to Mexico, in part due to the Trump administration's tariffs. Troy Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for BD, stated on Friday that the company was still in the process of making the shift, involving diagnostic devices and other products, and was assessing the latest tariff announcement.\n\nOn Thursday evening, President Trump announced via Twitter that he would impose a 5% tariff on Mexican imports starting June 10, with the potential to increase to 25% by October if immigration issues were not resolved. The immediate impact of these tariffs could be felt by consumers, particularly in the fresh fruits and vegetables market, where distributors may have little choice but to pass on costs.\n\nEmily Blanchard, an economist at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, expressed concern, stating, \"As a consumer, that was my first thought. Those are my avocados and strawberries. What are you doing?\"\n\nFor other products, the effects could be more gradual. Companies may initially absorb some of the costs to avoid losing business or on higher-margin items where they face competition from domestic producers. However, economic research shows that consumers eventually bear the brunt of tariffs. The impact could be greater in the case of trade with Mexico because many imports from there contain parts or materials from American factories.\n\nKatheryn Russ, an economist at the University of California, Davis, commented, \"We're taxing ourselves on our own goods.\"\n\nEconomists suggest that the direct effects of a 5% or even 10% tariff would likely be small, especially with a strong economy and low inflation. The larger threat, they say, is the disruption these tariffs could cause for automakers and others who have come to rely on supply chains that seamlessly cross international boundaries. Over time, these supply chains could break down, particularly if companies decide they cannot trust trade rules to be consistent from one year to the next.\n\nBrian Dunch, a trade expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers, stated, \"It's the cumulative effect of all this uncertainty. You'll see supply chains Balkanize.\"",
    " Title: Sanders Loses in States with Higher Income Inequality\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who has built his campaign on addressing income inequality, has been losing in states where income inequality is worse. Conversely, Hillary Clinton, his main rival, has been winning in states with higher income inequality.\n\nThis counterintuitive trend is evident in a chart of all 50 states showing their distance from the median of the Gini index, a widely used statistic that measures income inequality on a scale from 0 (total inequality) to 1 (total equality). The states are lined up from left to right, from the most equal (Alaska, at 0.4146, or 0.455 from the median) to the most unequal (New York, at 0.5048, or 0.447 from the median).\n\nThe pattern is striking: Clinton clearly wins in the most unequal states. And even in the one fairly equal state she won\u2014Iowa (that lonely, farthest-left green bar)\u2014she barely won, and even then only among \"state delegate equivalents,\" not voters.\n\nThis trend does not necessarily mean that Clinton is beating Sanders at appealing to voters on the basis of inequality. Instead, it may suggest that primary turnout is far more about party organization and campaign mobilization.\n\nThere are several factors that may be contributing to this trend. Race may play a role, as the South is both heavily unequal and heavily black. American blacks in general are more economically disadvantaged than whites nationwide, due in part to what they call \"deep-rooted, systemic problems.\" Sanders also appeals explicitly to rural voters in particular with his gun control stances, which may have helped fuel his performance in states with larger rural populations.\n\nThe simple geography of where candidates are from also played a small role here. Sanders happens to be from Vermont, the 11th most equal state. Clinton, meanwhile, claims New York (most unequal) as her home state, and just won there.\n\nIt's also true that inequality in New York is not the same as inequality in Louisiana, despite the fact that their Gini measures are pretty close. High poverty levels help drive Southern inequality, while in states like New York, Wall Street executives help push inequality higher.\n\nThe Gini index covers the full spectrum of income inequality, but the results are a bit more mixed when you look at another measure, like how much of the income the one-percenters earn. True, Clinton is still leading in the most-unequal state (New York) and Sanders still wins some of those most-equal states (Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont). But those Southern states are more mixed into the middle.\n\nStill, given Sanders' focus on the issue, he and his campaign might have thought he would be able to break through in places where inequality was worst. It just hasn't happened.",
    " Title: Schumer Criticizes Trump's Nominees, Cites Lack of Transparency and Paperwork Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) criticized President-elect Donald Trump's nominees during a press conference on Wednesday, labeling the cabinet picks as a \"swamp cabinet\" due to their backgrounds as bankers and billionaires. Schumer expressed disapproval over the scheduling of hearings for some nominees who had not yet submitted their paperwork to the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nSpecifically, Schumer pointed to Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Education, as her paperwork was not completed before Tuesday's hearing. \"The last two weeks have not been good for open and transparent government,\" Schumer stated.\n\nDemocrats have called for another hearing for DeVos, and Schumer warned that if Democrats feel Republicans are rushing nominees, they will force \"extensive debate\" on the Senate floor. This could potentially slow down the Republicans' efforts to get nominees confirmed.\n\nSenate leadership is currently negotiating over how many nominees will receive a vote before the full Senate on Friday.\n\nIn addition, Schumer suggested that Republicans should block Rep. Mick Mulvaney from leading the Office of Management and Budget due to his failure to pay taxes on a household employee. Schumer compared this to a scandal that derailed President Obama's initial Health and Human Services pick, Tom Daschle, who withdrew his 2009 nomination amid reports of unpaid taxes.\n\nMulvaney has since paid the $15,000 in taxes, as well as penalties, and the Trump team has dismissed the criticism, stating that Mulvaney has already taken \"appropriate follow-up measures.\"",
    " Title: Jack Lew's Confirmation Hearings: Questions on Fiscal Policy, Offshore Tax Havens, and Balanced Budget Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nJack Lew, President Obama's nominee for Treasury Secretary, faces a series of questions during his confirmation hearings today, primarily focusing on his role in the private sector, offshore tax havens, and his past claims about the federal debt and budget.\n\nLew, who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, is expected to answer questions about his lucrative layover at Citigroup, including a $940,000 bonus he received before the bank received a government bailout. Senators will also inquire about his role in the accumulation of bad mortgage debt that led to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe hearings will delve into Lew's understanding of finance, as he is an expert on fiscal issues but may lack knowledge about the private sector beyond the fact that large, highly regulated banks often hire powerful government officials. Senators will also question Lew about his decision to shelter his wealth in the Cayman Islands, and whether this action is consistent with the character he is expected to uphold as the head of the Treasury Department.\n\nIn addition to these personal questions, senators will ask about the president's disregard for budget and fiscal laws, such as the lack of a budget proposal this year and the president's failure to offer a solution when the Medicare trust fund is running low.\n\nThe hearings will also address the mounting federal debt, with Lew expected to finance an estimated $4 trillion in additional borrowing during President Obama's second term. With negotiations ongoing over the next fiscal crisis, Lew's answers will provide insight into the president's fiscal policy and his thoughts on the ongoing spending cuts agreed upon in the 2011 debt-limit deal.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues for Lew is his past claims that Obama's fiscal plan would lead to an end of borrowing and eventual debt reduction. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, has accused Lew of \"deliberate artifice\" for claiming that Obama's plan would lead to balanced budgets.\n\nSessions argues that Lew's claims were misleading, and he is counting on his colleagues to build a case against Lew, question by question. Democrats argue that Lew's claims were based on the expectation that Obama's plan would stimulate the economy, leading to increased revenues that could be plotted on a budget graph.\n\nThe hearings are unlikely to change many minds about the controversial nominee, but they will set the stage for a potential filibuster of Lew's nomination. If a powerful, high-ranking Republican accuses someone of lying under oath, his fellow Republicans will have to render their own judgment on the matter.\n\nLew is hoping to transition from a career focused on budget management into a role focused on policy and power. He will find that the stakes and consequences are much higher for the ones borrowing and spending the money rather than just counting it. With much eye-rolling about Obama's claims in his State of the Union speech that his new spending proposals wouldn't add \"one dime\" to the debt, it's a difficult moment for Lew to face Sessions' trap.",
    " Title: US Government's Intervention in Sugar Market Leads to Artificial Price Hikes and Taxpayer Losses\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been running a series of farm-and-rural programs and subsidies that, in practice, function as corporate welfare for agribusiness. One of the most significant consequences of the government's persistent interference is the creation of an artificially high sugar market, which benefits a limited number of farmers at the expense of the economy at large.\n\nThe federal government has implemented complex loan programs, import barriers, and production quotas to maintain artificially high domestic sugar prices. This results in American taxpayers supporting domestic sugar producers against free-market competition, and consumers across the country paying higher prices as a result.\n\nThe USDA is expected to buy sugar in the domestic market this year to drive prices up and prevent defaults on loans made to sugar processors. According to Barbara Fecso, an economist at the USDA, the department may need to buy 400,000 tons of sugar to boost prices to an \"acceptable level.\" A purchase of this amount would represent approximately 4.4% of projected U.S. sugar production in the marketing year ending on September 30.\n\nTo encourage ethanol producers to buy the sugar, the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation is expected to sell it at a loss of about 10 cents per pound, totaling $80 million. According to Ms. Fecso, the USDA would incur losses if it acquires sugar in a down market, as it would need to dispose of the sugar to avoid owning it. The USDA is expected to lose money regardless of how it disposes of the sugar, but selling it to ethanol producers at least provides some return on the investment.\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided does not offer a clear explanation of the \"acceptable level\" of sugar prices or the specific economic ripple effects of the government's sugar market intervention. Additionally, the article does not provide a comparison of the cost of the sugar subsidies to the potential benefits for the economy at large.",
    " Title: Study Highlights Concerns Over Declining Role of Facts in Public Life\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study, \"Truth Decay: An Initial Exploration of the Diminishing Role of Facts and Analysis in American Public Life,\" published by the Rand Corporation, examines the declining role of facts and analysis in public discourse. The study suggests that the increasing volume and velocity of information from the internet, social media, cable television, and talk radio are contributing factors to this trend.\n\nThe study identifies four trends that are detrimental to fact-based discourse and policymaking:\n\n1. Increasing disagreement about facts and their interpretations.\n2. The blurring of the line between fact and opinion.\n3. The increasing quantity of opinion relative to facts.\n4. Declining trust in formerly respected sources of factual information.\n\nThe authors, Michael D. Rich, the president of Rand, and his colleague Jennifer Kavanagh, argue that the information deluge, combined with the ability to curate personalized information, erodes society's assumption of a shared set of facts. This situation deepens the human proclivity for confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, leading to the formation of information silos.\n\nThe study also highlights the impact of gerrymandering, assortative mating, and geographic segregation of like-minded individuals, which contribute to the creation of echo chambers and polarization. Furthermore, the authors note that when filters and gatekeepers are removed, barriers to entry into public discourse become negligible, allowing for the proliferation of toxic digital subcultures.\n\nThe authors propose several suggestions to combat truth decay, ranging from teaching critical reasoning in schools to supporting long-form and investigative journalism with public funds. However, their primary purpose is to suggest research projects that will yield facts about the consequences of the new media and intellectual landscape.\n\nThe study also mentions the issue of simple mendacity, citing examples such as social-justice warriors at Google claiming that Lincoln was a member of the National Union Party instead of the Republican party. The authors caution that a default position of skepticism is defensible, given the historical context of deception in public life, such as Watergate, the Pentagon Papers, Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction, and the \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" controversy.\n\nThe study concludes by expressing concern over the spread of truth decay due to the proliferation of dime-store Nietzscheans on college campuses, who argue that there are no facts, only interpretations. The authors warn that what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses, and this ideology can have far-reaching consequences for public discourse and policymaking.",
    " Title: Romney and Ryan Accuse Obama Administration of Inconsistency in Libya Attack Explanation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint interview with running mate Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney accused the Obama administration of not being truthful about the circumstances surrounding the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, which resulted in the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Romney stated, \"We expect candor from the president and transparency, and he continues to refuse what is said by the other members of his administration: This was a terrorist attack. We were attacked apparently by Al Qaeda and it is a very troubling development.\"\n\nRomney's comments echoed complaints made by Republican lawmakers who question the administration's shifting explanation of the September 11 attack, initially described as \"spontaneous\" violence tied to protests over an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S. Obama officials have gradually walked back that description, and Obama acknowledged on Monday that it \"was not just a mob action.\"\n\nNational Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen was more direct last week, testifying to Congress that the four Americans \"were killed in the course of a terrorist attack.\" Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, questioned the president's consistency with his own administration officials, stating, \"When the director of the Counterterrorism Center comes to Congress and testifies and says that this is a terrorist attack... I think you would want to ask that question of the president, why he is not on the same page with his own administration officials?\"\n\nObama devoted much of his address to the United Nations General Assembly to the attack in Libya and unrest in the Mideast. He paid tribute to Ambassador Chris Stevens, recalling Stevens' time serving in the Peace Corps as an English instructor in Morocco. The president went on to restate his administration's support for the Arab Spring, calling it a \"season of progress.\" However, he did not mention terrorism in his U.N. speech and has yet to elaborate on how extremists were able to launch what now appears to have been a coordinated attack on the consulate.\n\nObama, in an interview taped Monday on ABC's \"The View,\" condemned extremist elements in the Muslim world and vowed the U.S. is \"not going to shrink back from the world because of this.\" He also stated, \"We are going to hunt down those who did this, we will bring them to justice.\" In the interview, which aired Tuesday, Obama said there was \"no doubt\" that the assault \"was not just a mob action\" but a sign of extremism in nations lacking stability.\n\nIn interviews and at campaign events Monday, Romney criticized Obama's leadership abroad, leading a chorus of Republicans in criticizing the president for what they said was minimizing the death of Ambassador Stevens. Obama, in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" said recent violence in the Mideast was due to \"bumps in the road\" on the way to democracy. Romney on Monday also suggested Obama was leaving American foreign policy at the mercy of events instead of working to shape global politics in America's interest.",
    " Title: Congress Considers Gun Control Bills as Trump Outlines Policy Preferences Remain Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will take up legislation on Tuesday aimed at preventing mass shootings, as lawmakers and the White House respond to a recent series of attacks across the country. The bills under consideration include measures to limit access to high-capacity gun magazines, block individuals convicted of hate crimes from obtaining firearms, and incentivize states to adopt extreme risk protection orders, also known as \"red flag\" laws.\n\nHowever, the Republican-controlled Senate's stance on these bills remains unclear, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he will not hold any votes on the issue until President Trump outlines his preferred policies. To date, Trump has called for action but has not publicly identified specific policies he supports, causing frustration among some of his Senate allies.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) expressed this sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press, stating, \"The president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do.\"\n\nThe White House has been meeting with members of Congress and those affected by mass shootings to gather feedback on potential next steps. Tony Montalto, president of Stand with Parkland, which advocates for measures to prevent such tragedies, said, \"We hope the president can take the lead.\" Montalto's 14-year-old daughter, Gina, was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nAfter back-to-back shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, killed 31 people, Trump called for strong action on expanding background checks. However, in recent weeks, Trump has expressed more concern about addressing mental health issues and the effectiveness of universal background checks.\n\n\"We have to protect our Second Amendment very strongly,\" Trump told reporters on Monday when asked about gun control.\n\nThe White House has stated that various measures are being weighed at this point. \"It's a deliberative process,\" said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley. \"We want to do something that will actually help...not just something that will make people feel good.\"\n\nMax Schachter, who attended the August White House meeting, lost his son, Alex, in the Parkland shooting. Schachter supports closing loopholes in background checks for gun buyers and expediting the death penalty for mass murderers.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have stated that they do not plan to abandon their push for gun control measures. \"We are not taking no for an answer. We are not going away,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) vowed at a news conference on Monday. She cited recent public opinion polls indicating widespread support for proposals like the House-passed bill requiring background checks for almost all gun sales.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has reportedly spoken to the president several times in the past month, stating that Trump is \"all over the lot\" on the gun issue. Schumer argued that the public support for new gun control measures indicates \"it's a different era\" from previous times when Congress failed to advance any legislation.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates' Plans to Address Iran Nuclear Deal and U.S.-Cuba Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo significant events are currently unfolding on August 14, 20XX. The first involves the visit of Secretary of State John Kerry to Cuba, and the second pertains to President Obama's ongoing efforts to secure Congressional approval for his nuclear deal with Iran. This article will outline the key points of each event and the proposed plans of a potential future president to address these issues.\n\nIran Nuclear Deal:\nThe Iran nuclear deal, a contentious topic, is centered around radical Shia clerics in Iran who seek to unite the world under their version of Islam and are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. They finance terrorists that seek to kill Americans and wipe Israel off the map. The deal, as proposed by President Obama, allows Iran to retain its existing nuclear infrastructure and endorses the construction of a full-scale, industrial-size nuclear program within 15 years.\n\nThe proposed plan by the unnamed presidential candidate aims to roll back the deal through a three-part strategy. First, the candidate plans to reimpose sanctions on Iran, limiting its nuclear program and economy. Second, the candidate will ask Congress to pass new measures targeting human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism. Third, the candidate intends to link any future talks with Iran to its broader conduct, including human rights abuses, support for terrorism, and threats against Israel.\n\nU.S.-Cuba Relations:\nThe normalization of relations with Cuba, another point of contention, involves the Castro regime's repressive tactics and opposition to American interests. The candidate's plan to address this issue includes a three-part strategy. First, the candidate will give the Castro regime a choice: either continue repressing its people and lose the diplomatic relations established by President Obama, or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased U.S. trade, investment, and support. Second, the candidate will restore Cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, helps North Korea evade international sanctions, or harbors fugitives from American justice. Third, the candidate will support Cuba's pro-democracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the Cuban people.\n\nIn conclusion, the unnamed presidential candidate has outlined plans to address the Iran nuclear deal and U.S.-Cuba relations through a three-part strategy for each issue. The candidate aims to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and to ensure the United States stands with the Cuban people, not their oppressors. However, the candidate acknowledges that these tasks will not be easy and will require strong, principled leadership.",
    " Title: Science Education Activist Challenges Wall Street Journal's Stephen Moore on Myths About Science Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, science education activist Zack Kopplin confronted The Wall Street Journal's Stephen Moore over misconceptions about science funding. Moore, who questioned the necessity of funding research on \"snail mating habits,\" was criticized for his lack of scientific background.\n\nThe purpose of such research, as Kopplin explained, is due to the fact that snails carry parasitic worms that cause schistosomiasis, a disease that is the second most socioeconomically devastating after malaria. These parasitic worms are transmitted to humans through infected snails, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water and sanitation facilities is limited. The worms' infectious larvae emerge from the snails, travel in shallow water, and easily penetrate human skin, maturing in internal organs. The result is schistosomiasis. As of 2009, 74 developing nations had reported significant rates of schistosomiasis in human populations.\n\nMoore is not a fringe right-wing figure; he is a senior economics writer and an editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal. During a nationally televised show, he advocated for ending a government-funded scientific study while boasting about his lack of understanding of the research behind it.\n\nThis incident echoes similar sentiments expressed by Rush Limbaugh on his radio show the same day, suggesting that science today is an extension of the Democratic Party.\n\nFor conservative media figures like Moore and Limbaugh, scientific ignorance appears to be a deliberate choice rather than an oversight. From climate science and polar bears to economics to condoms to social sciences to duck penises, conservative media perpetuate the same anti-science behavior repeatedly. The argument is that scientists are inherently biased because they are passionate about science. This is a third-rate sophism combined with fourth-rate Luddism.\n\nIt is essential to note that this article does not imply that all scientists are correct by default. Instead, it advocates for respecting the scientific method, where scientists present arguments with data and rigorously test ideas until a consensus emerges. This is essentially a free market for scientific ideas. Is this approach something conservatives should be interested in?\n\nFor more information on the scientific method and research projects, readers are encouraged to visit Zack Kopplin's petition.",
    " Title: Virginia's Off-Year Elections: A Test for the GOP in a Swing State\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party in Washington is facing a significant challenge in the form of Virginia's off-year elections, which they view as an opportunity to recover from the losses of 2012 and reset the political debate in a crucial swing state. The elections could also serve as a platform to send outgoing Governor Bob McDonnell on a high note and deliver a national message about the direction of the Republican Party.\n\nHowever, the Republican state Legislature, local conservative leadership, and the de facto gubernatorial nominee have caused concerns among party strategists. The GOP-held state Senate has stirred national attention with controversial proposals, such as a plan to redraw the legislative map and a suggestion to divide Virginia's Electoral College votes by congressional district.\n\nThese actions followed the 2012 uproar over a Virginia measure, championed by conservative state Del. Bob Marshall, mandating ultrasound procedures for women seeking abortions. This issue was used by Democrats as a national cause, driving Virginia women away from the Republican ticket and undercutting McDonnell's vice presidential contender and Senate candidate George Allen, who ultimately lost to former governor Tim Kaine.\n\nThe same legislative body that steered the 2012 GOP message off course has struggled to refocus on a winning agenda for 2013. The unresolved redistricting controversy has been a distraction from McDonnell's ambitious proposals to overhaul education and transportation. The Virginia House of Delegates is expected to decide soon whether or not to take up the Senate's provocative new legislative map, with McDonnell's legacy and national profile once again at stake.\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who has criticized the state GOP since withdrawing from the governor's race late last year, lamented the partisan atmosphere in the Virginia capital. \"I've been very disappointed that this session has taken on such a partisan tone,\" Bolling, who has toyed with an independent run for governor, told a news outlet. \"We have some very big issues on the table this year like transportation funding and education reform, and we don't want to see those issues compromised because of partisan spats over redistricting or anything else.\"\n\nThe stakes are high, as Virginia has become one of the most important swing states in the country, a traditional GOP stronghold that now has two Democratic U.S. senators and voted twice for President Barack Obama. A triumphant last year for McDonnell, capped by a victory for Republicans in the 2013 governor's race, could at least start the process of turning back that tide.\n\nAt the moment, it's an open question whether the GOP will have the discipline to pull that off. While polls show the 2013 governor's race is highly competitive, Republicans have felt distinctly anxious in recent weeks over a series of hard-right comments by state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a hero of national conservatives who has continued to speak out on issues such as contraception and the Affordable Care Act despite outside pressure to pivot toward the middle.",
    " Title: Investigation Launched into Alleged Hoax of Fake Sexual Assault Allegations Against Robert Mueller\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Gateway Pundit writer Jacob Wohl and Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman have been exposed for attempting to promote false sexual assault allegations against FBI special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a report by NBC News.\n\nApproximately two weeks ago, prominent reporters received an email from a woman claiming that someone associated with Burkman was offering money to make false sexual assault allegations. After reporters contacted Mueller's office to inquire about the claims, Mueller requested that the FBI investigate the apparent hoax.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, told NBC News, \"When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the special counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation.\"\n\nReporters began investigating the source of the claims, which were being promoted by Wohl and Burkman online. Wohl tweeted on Oct. 19 that a \"prominent DC insider\" told him that women were \"prepared to make credible allegations\" against Mueller.\n\nOn Tuesday, Burkman announced that he would reveal the first of Mueller's accusers at a Nov. 1 press conference. One of the women was supposed to claim that she worked at the law firm Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro in 1974, and that was when the alleged assault would have taken place. However, the law firm told NBC News that there was no record of that woman ever having worked there.\n\nBurkman claimed he was investigating sexual misconduct and alcohol allegations. When media inquiries were made, Burkman responded by telling The Hill Reporter that Jacob Wohl ran Surefire Intelligence, a firm that was supposedly involved in the investigation. Wohl, however, denied any connection to the sexual assault investigation and to Surefire Intelligence.\n\nHowever, evidence suggested otherwise. Wohl's email was listed in the domain records for Surefire Intelligence's website, the phone number for the company redirected to Wohl's mother's voicemail, and alleged Surefire employees had fake LinkedIn profiles using headshots of random people pulled from the internet. One alleged employee even looked suspiciously like Wohl himself, under the name \"Matthew Cohen.\"\n\nThere were other tells that Surefire was a fraudulent company. The company's LLC was just incorporated a few weeks ago, and the address Surefire listed is occupied by a law firm that said it had no connection to Surefire. Wohl stopped responding to NBC News when they called him out about the phone numbers.\n\nGateway Pundit published alleged \"exclusive documents\" about the fake sexual assault allegation, but later took them down and is reportedly looking into the allegations that Pundit writer Jacob Wohl was involved in the scheme. The documents posted on Gateway Pundit indicated that one woman would accuse Mueller of sexual misconduct at a New York City hotel on Aug. 2, 2010. However, Mueller was serving jury duty in Washington, D.C. on that day.\n\nUPDATE: Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft tweeted that the site has taken down documents it posted related to the fabricated allegations against Mueller, and that it is also looking into the allegations that Pundit writer Jacob Wohl was involved in the scheme.",
    " Title: Amtrak Train Collides with Freight Train in South Carolina, Killing Two Crew Members and Injuring 116\n\nAn Amtrak passenger train, traveling from New York to Miami, collided with a parked CSX Corp freight train in Cayce, South Carolina, on Sunday, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 116 others. This is the fourth fatal crash involving an Amtrak train since December.\n\nThe incident occurred at approximately 2:35 a.m. local time (0735 GMT) when Amtrak Train 91, carrying nine crew members and 136 passengers, hit a CSX freight train that was stopped on a side track, or siding. The section of track was operated by CSX, and the Amtrak train was diverted onto the siding at a switch where a padlock had been attached, according to Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Board (NTSB).\n\nThe NTSB is investigating the cause of the collision, with a particular focus on understanding why the switch was lined in the direction that led to the collision. The damage to the locomotives has been described as \"catastrophic.\" An NTSB investigation team is at the site.\n\nAmtrak engineer Michael Kempf, 54, of Savannah, Georgia, and conductor Michael Cella, 36, of Orange Park, Florida, were killed in the crash. Autopsies are currently being conducted.\n\nTwo of the 116 injured individuals are in critical condition. The collision occurred approximately 5 miles (8 km) southwest of the state capital, Columbia.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster described the scene as \"horrible\" and stated that the first engine of the freight train was \"torn up,\" and the single engine of the passenger train is \"barely recognizable.\"\n\nAmtrak expressed its condolences for the deaths and stated that CSX owns and controls the dispatching of all trains, including the signal systems that control access to sidings and yards. Amtrak President and CEO Richard Anderson stated that the passenger train hit the tail end of the CSX train, which had two locomotives and 34 empty auto racks.\n\nImages from the scene show the passenger train's locomotive lying on its side, and the first car bent and derailed, although it remained upright. At least four of the freight train's cars were crumpled but remained on the tracks.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump received regular updates on the crash while at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. He tweeted, \"My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this morning's train collision in South Carolina.\"\n\nIn December, three people were killed when an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Washington state. In late January, an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of the U.S. Congress killed one person in a garbage truck with which it collided in Virginia.\n\nA Federal Railroad Administration Investigative team is also on the scene in South Carolina to help establish what happened. The U.S. Department of Transportation stated, \"It is important to understand the factors that contributed to this tragic accident and how all stakeholders can ensure a safe and reliable rail system going forward.\"",
    " Title: Facebook's Removal of Protest Information Sparks Free Speech Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Facebook has faced criticism for removing information related to anti-lockdown protests, citing potential violations of large public gathering restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The move has sparked a debate over free speech, with some accusing Facebook of colluding with state governments to suppress free speech, while others praise the company for combating harmful misinformation.\n\nSenator Donald Trump Jr. accused Facebook of colluding with state governments to quash free speech, calling the actions \"chilling and disturbing.\" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned the company's decision, asking, \"Because free speech is now illegal America?\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) expressed concern that Facebook and government officials are partnering to shut down views with which they disagree.\n\nOn the other hand, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal praised Facebook's move, stating that the company is right to take a stand against harmful misinformation. Protesters have demonstrated against stay-at-home orders, and Facebook initially indicated that it had removed the protest information at the request of states whose authorities said they violated restrictions on large public gatherings. However, the company later clarified that it sought guidance from states but ultimately made its own decision to take the posts down.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered a slightly different explanation in an interview with ABC News, suggesting that the company removes content that disputes social distancing practices and therefore poses a \"risk of imminent physical harm.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Facebook has faced criticism for its policies on removing content. The company has faced blowback for its handling of misleading political ads and vaccine misinformation. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, stated that Facebook, which controls a platform for the speech of billions, should not be censoring political speech online.\n\nDavid Greene, civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argued that Facebook seemingly deciding to remove protests based on whether they violate state law provides an objective yardstick. However, he noted that without further clarity, it can be difficult to judge the fairness of the company's decisions and ensure that they do not disadvantage certain groups or types of protests.\n\nMatthew Feeney, the director of the libertarian Cato Institute's project on emerging technologies, contends that preventing deaths during a pandemic offers Facebook a defensible rationale for removing content. However, he noted that Facebook and other social networks are not bound by the First Amendment and often \"punt\" by looking to state laws or non-government groups for rules they can enforce.\n\nFacebook, Google, Twitter, and other social media companies have long denied that politics is a factor in their decisions about what content they will and will not allow. The companies have sought to make their process more transparent, with Facebook in particular announcing the creation of an independent board to review content moderation judgments. However, when it comes to content or advertising that is explicitly political, Facebook has at times concluded that inaction is the best action. For example, when Twitter and Google imposed new restrictions on political advertising last year, Facebook stuck to its policy of not fact-checking political ads or limiting their reach.\n\nIn a speech at Georgetown University last fall, Zuckerberg laid out an aggressive approach to \"freedom of expression,\" acknowledging that \"free expression has never been absolute.\" Zuckerberg cited social and civil rights activists over the centuries as examples that inspired his stance, saying free speech and protests have enabled progress no matter how disquieting they felt at the time. However, in recent years, Zuckerberg said, people have expanded what they consider to be dangerous speech.",
    " Title: U.S. Congress and President Obama Negotiate \"Fiscal Cliff\" Deal, but No Agreement Reached as New Year's Day Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nWith New Year's Day fast approaching, the U.S. Congress and President Obama are engaged in last-minute negotiations to avoid the \"fiscal cliff,\" a combination of across-the-board tax increases and automatic spending cuts set to take effect. As of Sunday evening, no deal has been reached, but negotiations are ongoing.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, announced Sunday that there is still a significant distance between the two sides, but there is still time to reach an agreement by Monday's midnight deadline. He stated that negotiations would continue.\n\nTalks stalled at one point on Sunday, prompting the top Republican negotiator, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to bypass Mr. Reid and speak directly with Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nThe impasse seemed to lift somewhat when Republicans dropped their demand to change Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment formula, and both sides traded offers on the income level at which taxpayers will see an income-tax rate increase and debated what other incentives would be included.\n\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, explained why the party decided to forgo demands for entitlement reform, stating, \"You can't win an argument that has Social Security for seniors versus taxes for the rich. So we need to take it off the table.\"\n\nA deal would need to clear not only the Senate but also the House, where conservative Republicans hold sway. In the absence of an agreement, Senate Democrats are preparing to force a vote on Monday on their own fallback solution, which would raise taxes on families making more than $250,000, extend unemployment benefits, and could include other party priorities.\n\nHowever, this legislation is unlikely to reach President Obama's desk, leaving a small window for a deal that could prevent millions of taxpayers from facing rate increases.\n\nThe fiscal cliff encompasses the combination of across-the-board tax increases set to take effect on Tuesday, followed by $110 billion in automatic spending cuts imposed as a result of last year's deal to raise the debt ceiling. Analysts predict that the combination will plunge the economy into a short, sharp recession, though in the long run, the deficit would drop, government debt would return to manageable levels, and the economy would be stronger over the next decade.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner traded blame for the situation. Mr. Obama stated on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" program that Republicans prioritize protecting tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, while Mr. Boehner countered that the House has passed bills to cancel the tax cuts and the automatic spending \"sequesters,\" and that Mr. Obama could have prevented the situation by pressuring Senate Democrats to send the House a bill.\n\nBoth sides have moved substantially. The Republicans have conceded one of their major principles in agreeing to higher tax rates, while Mr. Obama has stated he could accept tax increases beginning at income levels higher than the ones on which he campaigned: $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families. The latest offer from Republicans is to let rates rise on individuals making more than $450,000 and families making more than $550,000, according to Democrats, who countered with rates above the $360,000 and $450,000 levels.\n\nRegardless of what happens with marginal rates, all taxpayers are likely to see at least some tax increases with the expiration of the 2 percentage-point payroll-tax holiday, which was worth about $1,000 to the average taxpayer last year. It is also unclear whether any final deal will cancel the other part of the cliff: the $110 billion in automatic spending cuts set to take effect on Wednesday.\n\nAs leaders continue to negotiate, some senators are preparing their own workarounds in case the negotiations break down at the leaders' level. Sen. Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican, stated, \"I've talked with numerous Democrats and Republicans on the floor, and there are a lot of subgroups who are eager to tackle this issue and try to come up with a solution if the negotiations break down at the leaders' level.\"",
    " Title: No Charges Filed in NASCAR Noose Incident, FBI Determines Rope Was Present Since October 2019\n\nArticle:\n\nNASCAR went to Talladega Superspeedway on heightened alert after Bubba Wallace, its only Black driver, took an active role in a push for racial equality. The noose found hanging in Wallace's garage stall at Talladega had been there since at least last October, federal authorities announced Tuesday, stating there will be no charges filed in the incident that rocked NASCAR.\n\nU.S. Attorney Jay Town and FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr. stated that the investigation determined \"nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned\" to the stall in question. NASCAR said it was the lone garage stall with a pull-down rope that resembled a noose.\n\nNASCAR has defended its reaction and insisted it would call the FBI again if a similar situation arises. Wallace, who never saw the rope, said it had been fashioned into a noose.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure this wasn't just a knot,\" Wallace said on CNN. \"It was a noose.\"\n\nWallace, who instantly began to fear for the safety of his family, remained angry at what he perceives as constant tests of his character. He holds no ill-will toward NASCAR.\n\n\"I stand behind Steve and I stand behind NASCAR,\" he said. \"NASCAR was worried about Talladega. We had that one circled on the radar with everything going on.\"\n\nNASCAR opened the Talladega gates to 5,000 fans, its highest number so far during the coronavirus pandemic. Since finding his voice over the last month, the 26-year-old Mobile, Alabama native has embraced an international role in NASCAR's attempt to push past its rocky racial history.\n\nThe FBI sent 15 agents to Talladega for Monday's rescheduled race at the same time the industry rallied around Wallace. In an unprecedented show of solidarity, every team member on pit road lined up behind him during the national anthem.\n\nNASCAR President Steve Phelps has taken nine questions about the finding in Wallace's garage and none provided any details of the incident. Roughly 48 hours after the discovery, federal authorities said video confirmed the rope \"was in that garage as early as October 2019\" hanging from a garage door. The rope was referred to as a noose, but can be used as a handle when closing the door.\n\nPhelps continued to call it a noose after authorities said no charges would be filed, and held firm in that NASCAR is investigating why the rope was tied that way. He was pleased it wasn't a hate crime directed at Wallace, but insisted NASCAR would have conducted its investigation the same way even now knowing it was just a coincidence.\n\n\"We would have done the same investigation,\" he said. \"The evidence was very clear that the noose that was in the garage was in there previously. The last race we had in October, that noose was present. The evidence we had, it was clear we needed to look into this.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wood Brothers Racing team said it cooperated with the investigation and an employee recalled \"seeing a tied handle in the garage pull-down rope from last fall,\" when the team had the stall. NASCAR, which first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order, has yet to detail how it will answer Wallace's call to stop the display of the flag.",

The training is a response to the atrocities committed by the Islamic State (ISIS) against the Yazidi community.\n\nOn Sunday, a Reuters photographer visited a training camp at the Serimli military base in Qamishli, northeastern Syria, on the border with Iraqi Kurdistan. The photographer observed 55 Yazidis being trained to fight ISIS. The trainees, both young and old men, were taught how to use assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades by Syrian Kurds, sweating in the 40-degree Celsius heat.\n\nThe Yazidi civilians wish to remain in Syria due to safety concerns, but the volunteers are eager to return to Iraq to fight. The training period for these newly armed civilians is relatively short, with several days of training before they risk their lives fighting ISIS.\n\nIn Syria, the Yazidi volunteers undergo training in weapon use and fighting tactics for several days before being sent back to Mount Sinjar to fight, according to Anas Hani, a member from the media office of the Kurdish YPG. Hani stated that there are several training camps for Yazidi men who have volunteered, and hundreds have graduated in the past ten days, with more training ongoing.\n\nISIS is a highly sophisticated fighting force, but the brave, all-women battalion already fighting these murderous jihadists in Iraq may find support from these Yazidi volunteers. The exact number of Yazidis massacred by ISIS remains unknown, but reports of the atrocities committed against this peaceful group have been disturbing. Kidnapped Yazidi girls continue to be forced into slavery and unwanted compulsory marriages.",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Order on Climate Change, Announces New White House Office of American Innovation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken swift action to restore momentum following his unsuccessful attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order that rolls back some of President Obama's key policies on climate change and carbon emissions. The previous day, Attorney General Jeff Sessions made a surprise appearance at the White House daily media briefing to discuss the administration's opposition to so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nOn Monday, the president announced the new White House Office of American Innovation, led by his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. The group aims to develop fresh solutions to persistent problems afflicting American society.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether this burst of activity can help Trump find his footing or settle jangled nerves on the right. The failed push to repeal ObamaCare, which reached its denouement last Friday, was a significant setback even for the president's natural allies. While some Republicans, such as Speaker Paul Ryan, are vowing to revisit ObamaCare, there is no clear path forward.\n\nInvestigations into alleged connections between Russia and people in Trump's orbit, as well as the related controversy over the conduct of Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, are also pestering the administration. The next big-ticket item on Trump's agenda is tax reform, but any push toward that goal will be subject to the same treacherous cross-currents on Capitol Hill that sank the healthcare push.\n\nExecutive orders repealing Obama-era regulations and hard-edged rhetoric on illegal immigration at least give supporters heart. \"I don't think his agenda has changed,\" said Barry Bennett, who served as a senior adviser for Trump's presidential bid. \"But, Bennett added, items that did not require congressional approval 'are going to happen, so [the White House] can shift the narrative when they desire, which is what they are doing.'\"\n\nTrump has not focused only on policy since the healthcare push went awry. He has taken to Twitter to blame the conservative House Freedom Caucus for his defeat and has insisted that ObamaCare will \"explode.\" Fueling the kind of palace intrigue that has surrounded his White House, Trump tweeted a recommendation that his followers should watch Jeanine Pirro's Fox News show over the weekend. Pirro used that platform to call for the resignation of Speaker Paul Ryan. The White House pushed back at suggestions that Trump knew what Pirro was going to say.\n\nTo some critics, Trump's feverish level of activity has a negative flip side: an unwillingness to do the honest self-reflection that might help him avoid repeating mistakes. \"He lives in a sort of reality-distortion field where he doesn't want to acknowledge that he makes any mistakes,\" said Timothy O'Brien, the author of a biography of Trump. \"He very rarely acknowledges making mistakes, and I think that is largely because he has been insulated from the consequences of his mistakes his whole life.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump often displayed a propensity to create the kind of big news that drowned out his rivals. His initial announcement that he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the United States came with the Iowa caucuses looming. It was made within hours of a poll showing his then-rival Sen. Ted Cruz leading Trump in the state.\n\nTwo months later, Trump again threw out the political rulebook and hit back at criticism from Pope Francis. Another Trump biographer, Michael D'Antonio, noted at the time on CNN's website that \"even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles.\"\n\n\"If he did not bounce back from adversity, he would be hosting 'The Apprentice' at the current time,\" said Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor who specializes in political communication. \"He's the maestro of agenda-setting, both for good and bad. All it takes is 140 characters [on Twitter] and at least one or two news cycles get converted to focusing on a new aspect of Trump and his presidency.\"\n\nCritical voices like O'Brien's believe Trump is in a different world now, however\u2014subject to the intense scrutiny that faces any president and with the Russian controversy lapping at his feet. \"The most dangerous thing, staring him right in the face, is the Russia investigation,\" O'Brien said. \"And all of his diversionary tactics haven't actually taken that away as the central thing that the media and Capitol Hill are looking at. He hasn't changed the narrative on that and, in fact, the response has been very ham-handed. Exhibit A on that is Devin Nunes.\"\n\nBut Trump loyalists remain convinced that he can bounce back once again, even when the stakes are at their highest. \"I am still very optimistic,\" said Bennett. \"We had bad days in the campaign. Next day, we're on to the next fight.\" The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump's presidency.",
    " Title: \"Rove Criticizes Defunding Obamacare Efforts as Unrealistic, Predicting Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nKarl Rove, a prominent Republican strategist, has expressed skepticism towards the efforts of the Defund-Obamacare Caucus to defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Rove, who was a key advisor to former President George W. Bush, has stated that the defunding strategy is unrealistic due to the lack of support from Democrats in the Senate.\n\nAccording to Rove, the defunders would first need to convince some Democrats or a significant number of them to join their quest. However, he believes this is highly unlikely. If, hypothetically, the defunders were able to garner enough support, the president would simply veto the measure. Overturning the veto would require a majority in both the House and Senate, which Rove states is not feasible.\n\nDespite these challenges, the defunders continue their efforts, even after Senator Ted Cruz admitted the votes were not available and after the principal cheerleader for defunding, Jim DeMint, admitted that the effort is primarily a public relations stunt. Last week, the defunders staged a power move against House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, who had been trying to negotiate a more tactical approach.\n\nThe standoff between the defunders and the House leadership could lead to a government shutdown, potentially affecting nearly all federal activities. In the event of a shutdown, public outrage would likely fall upon the Republican Party, as it did during the 1995 shutdown.\n\nWhile the Democrats are not without fault in this situation, the article notes that they have the necessary votes to maintain their position. As Oscar Wilde said, \"It would take a heart of stone not to laugh out loud\" at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's complaint that \"bipartisanship is a thing of the past.\" Reid's history of intransigence is also central to the current standoff.\n\nThe article also touches on the upcoming debate over the debt ceiling, another fiscal issue that will follow the appropriations fight. President Obama and the Democrats have stated that they will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, while some argue that congressional conservatives are holding the debt ceiling and the country's credit rating hostage.\n\nThe article concludes by comparing the situation to a Hollywood action movie scenario, where the hero is faced with a villain threatening an innocent hostage. In this case, the hero, President Obama, is not backing down, instead willing to let the conservative Republicans shoot the innocent bystander in the head, so he can shoot them in the foot. The article suggests that this is not a noble approach.\n\nFinally, the article highlights the long-term fiscal challenges facing the country, with the Congressional Budget Office reporting that the nation's long-term fiscal trajectory is unsustainable without real and deep cuts to entitlements. The article argues that the defunding of Obamacare is a denial of mathematical reality, but the question of the national debt is a far graver issue that the whole country is facing.\"",
    " Title: Kushner's \"Shadow Task Force\" on Coronavirus and the Role of Health Insurance Company Oscar\n\nArticle:\n\nFor several weeks, Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, has reportedly led a \"shadow task force\" on the coronavirus, separate from Vice President Mike Pence's official committee. This task force, which includes federal officials allied with Kushner and outside corporate executives, has been meeting at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, an HHS senior official contacted Oscar, a health insurance company, on March 13, the day of Trump's press conference, to seek its help. Kushner's group has focused on expanding and publicizing coronavirus testing, particularly at drive-through locations.\n\nOscar was developing a coronavirus-testing website prior to the HHS call, and the company offered its work freely to the government. The website, which resembled a tool Oscar had already built for its customers, was designed to look like a government-developed product provided freely by the Department of Health and Human Services to the American public. The site listed a limited number of testing locations nationwide, including some drive-through sites that Trump had promised.\n\nHowever, the website was never launched. Jackie Kahn, an Oscar spokesperson, stated that the company's involvement was a coincidence and had nothing to do with Kushner. She declined to discuss whether Oscar had discussed its site with Joshua Kushner or any board members or investors before Trump's March 13 press conference.\n\nThe ad hoc nature of Kushner's task force has already raised federal law concerns. The involvement of Oscar in the task force deepens Kushner's ethics and conflict-of-interest problems, according to experts.\n\nJessica Tillipman, an assistant dean at the George Washington University School of Law and an expert on anti-corruption law, stated that Oscar's relationship with the Trump administration could breach federal law in two ways. First, companies are generally not supposed to work for the federal government for free, though some exceptions can be made in a national emergency. \"The concern, when you have some free services, is that it makes the government beholden to the company,\" Tillipman said.\n\nThe second potential breach of federal law involves the use of private resources for government work. Tillipman and other experts noted that if Oscar's work was not compensated, it could be considered an in-kind contribution, which is prohibited under the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n\nThe exact nature of Oscar's relationship with the Trump administration remains unclear, as does the extent of Kushner's role in the \"shadow task force.\" The ad hoc nature of the task force and the potential legal issues it raises continue to be a topic of discussion and concern.",
    " Title: Intra-Party Disagreements: Gillibrand Criticizes Obama on Military Sex Crimes, Pelosi Opposes Trade Bills\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has criticized President Barack Obama for his handling of the fight against military sex crimes, stating that he has not fulfilled his December 2013 promise to overhaul the Defense Department's judicial system if progress was not made within a year. Gillibrand's remarks come after the Senate voted down an amendment she sponsored that aimed to change the way sexual assault is prosecuted in the military, removing it from the military justice chain of command.\n\nGillibrand's public rebuke of a fellow Democrat follows House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) decision to vote against two related trade bills last week. Pelosi, who had been seen as a silent ally to Obama and the Republican-led House in promoting Obama's trade agenda, kept her position secret until the end of Friday's debate, when she announced her opposition.\n\nPelosi stated that her opposition was to win a broader fight, arguing that \"our people would rather have a job than trade assistance.\" She added that while she supported a bill to help workers who lost their job due to foreign trade, she opposed fast-track legislation, which would allow the president to negotiate trade deals with limited Congressional interference.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential election, appeared to back Pelosi, mentioning Pelosi's efforts to challenge Obama's free trade deal negotiations twice. Clinton stated, \"The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact a weak agreement would have on our workers, to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible.\"\n\nToday, Gillibrand's amendment failed in the Senate, but Democratic opposition to President Obama on trade, military sexual assault, and other issues is likely to continue.",
    " Title: Boy's Distress Call Preceded Sewol Ferry's Distress Call, South Korean Coast Guard Confirms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe South Korean coast guard has confirmed that a distress call from the sinking ferry Sewol was not made by the crew, but by a boy who used a cell phone to contact emergency services from aboard the ship. The boy's fate remains unclear.\n\nThe boy dialed South Korea's emergency number, telling dispatchers for a local fire service, \"Help us. The boat is sinking.\" This revelation is likely to add to questions about the conduct of the crew, nine of whom are facing charges in last week's sinking.\n\nThe first distress call from the ferry Sewol came three minutes after the initial call from the boy. The ship's crew made a distress call to maritime officials three minutes later.\n\nAt least 146 people are confirmed dead, according to the joint task force leading the search. Earlier, when the death toll was reported to be 128, authorities had said that 174 people were still missing. The death toll had been expected to climb as divers were able to reach the ship's cafeteria, where many passengers were thought to be when the ship began to have troubles last week. However, early Wednesday, the coast guard said no bodies had been found in the cafeteria.\n\nRescuers will continue to focus on the third and fourth decks of the five-level ship, said Koh Myung-seok, a spokesman for the joint task force. Above the ship, two buoys marked its location in the water, surrounded by dozens of vessels, ranging from dinghies to warships. Inflatable powerboats zipped across the sea, ferrying divers to the area.\n\nSearchers used guide ropes to lead them into the submerged ferry. Bard Yoon, one of the divers, said conditions are so bad \"my heart aches.\"\n\n\"We're going in thinking there may be survivors,\" he said. \"When we have to come back with nothing, we can't even face the families.\"\n\nOn shore, relatives of missing passengers waited anxiously, many of them parents of high school students who were on a field trip. As bodies come in, they are called into white domed tents to identify the remains of their loved ones.\n\nAuthorities said the efforts are still a search and rescue operation, but no survivors have been found since 174 people were rescued soon after the ferry went down.\n\nAs the search continues, investigators are trying to figure out what happened to make the ship list before finally capsizing and sinking into the ocean. Initial criticism has focused on the captain and some crew members. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Monday that their actions were \"akin to murder.\"\n\nThe captain, Lee Joon-seok, has defended his decision to tell passengers to stay put as the ferry began sinking, saying he was concerned about the sea's strong currents and cold water as well as the lack of rescue ships. Questions have been raised about why the third mate was steering the ship when it ran into trouble on its way to a popular vacation island. The captain was in his cabin at the time.\n\nChonghaejin Marine, which operated the ferry, has posted an apology on its website. \"We pray for the Sewol victims who lost their precious lives due to the accident,\" it said. \"We prostrate ourselves before the victims' families and beg for forgiveness.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Agencies Conclude COVID-19 Not Manmade, Investigating Possible Lab Leak\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the novel coronavirus was not manmade or genetically modified but are still examining whether the origins of the pandemic may be traced to contact with infected animals or an accident at a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of U.S. spy agencies, comes as President Donald Trump and his allies have promoted the unproven theory that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic that has killed over 220,000 worldwide.\n\nThe statement reads, \"The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified. The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\"\n\nTrump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have made public statements speculating about the lab, with Trump stating, \"More and more, we\u2019re hearing the story.\" Pompeo added, \"The mere fact that we don\u2019t know the answers\u2014that China hasn\u2019t shared the answers\u2014I think is very, very telling.\" Pompeo also pressed China to allow outside experts into the lab \"so that we can determine precisely where this virus began.\"\n\nWhile Trump and Pompeo have made public statements speculating about the lab, a U.S. intelligence official disputed the notion that there was any pressure on agencies to bolster a particular theory. The intelligence official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nScientists say the virus arose naturally in bats. However, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the SARS virus, finding new bat viruses, and discovering how they could jump to people.\n\nU.S. officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but they have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later. The Chinese government said Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory are \"unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing.\"\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang cited the institute's director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen. Geng also criticized U.S. politicians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on \"better controlling the epidemic situation at home.\"\n\nHowever, a Chinese government spokesman, Zhao Lijian, demonstrated that China was not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic. He tweeted in March the falsehood that the virus might have come from the U.S. Army.",

In a series of tweets on March 19, Omar commended Trump's recent efforts to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, describing them as \"incredible\" and the \"right response in this critical time.\"\n\nOmar retweeted comments from Democratic Massachusetts Representative Ayanna Pressley, who praised \"unprecedented leadership\" in the country during these unprecedented times. Omar agreed, stating, \"we should never let politics get in the way of good policy.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Omar expressed hope that other politicians would join a \"united front\" to push for policies that would help the nation navigate the economic anxiety caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOmar's praise for the president comes as other notable Trump critics have also voiced favorable opinions of the president's response to the coronavirus crisis. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, a frequent Trump critic, urged his viewers to rally around the president and his efforts on March 17. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and CNN's Dana Bash have also praised Trump's reaction to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency on March 13, promoted a $1 trillion stimulus bill, and has ordered military hospital ships to the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the U.S. to treat coronavirus victims.",
    " Title: Nick Sandmann Discusses Lincoln Memorial Encounter, Claims Lack of Disrespect Toward Nathan Phillips\n\nArticle:\n\nNick Sandmann, one of the Covington Catholic High School students involved in the controversial encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., has stated that he was not disrespectful towards Phillips during the incident. In an interview with Savannah Guthrie airing Wednesday on TODAY, Sandmann expressed regret for the encounter but maintained his innocence regarding any disrespectful behavior.\n\nIn a preview clip released Tuesday evening, Savannah asked Sandmann if he felt he owed anyone an apology for his role in the incident, which went viral. Sandmann replied, \"As far as standing there, I had every right to do so. My position is that I was not disrespectful to Mr. Phillips. I respect him. I'd like to talk to him. 'In hindsight, I wish we could have walked away and avoided the whole thing.'\"\n\nThe incident occurred after a widely circulated video showed Sandmann, wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat, appearing to grin close to Phillips' face as the activist sang and played a drum during an Indigenous Peoples March. Sandmann's family released a statement over the weekend through a public relations firm, in which Sandmann claimed that the encounter followed an incident in which four African-American protestors directed \"derogatory insults\" at his school group. He stated that, with permission from a chaperone, he led students in school spirit chants to counter the hateful things being shouted at their group.\n\nIn the statement, Sandmann said he \"never interacted\" with Phillips and was \"startled and confused as to why he had approached me.\" Phillips has stated that he approached the students, hoping to defuse the tension from a heated exchange he said he saw the group have with Black Hebrew Israelites.\n\nPhillips has criticized the school chaperones, telling MSNBC's Joy Reid, \"Where were they? How did they allow these students to come to this point after an hour of this happening? Were they with them? Were they encouraging them?\" Phillips told NBC News in an interview, \"Instead of being expelled, the students should go through some kind of sensitivity training. That they should...cultural education of some kind. And if they don't, then don't graduate.\"\n\nCovington Catholic High School has stated that the students were in Washington, D.C., to attend the March for Life rally.

    " Title: Trump's Tax Reform Plan and Its Potential Impact on National Debt\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's long-awaited tax reform plan, recently unveiled in a one-page outline, appears to cater to conservative ideals, with proposed reductions in corporate and top income tax rates, the repeal of the Obamacare tax on investments, and a doubling of the standard income tax deduction. The plan aims to help both the working class and the wealthy, but it has been met with concerns regarding the potential increase in the national debt.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, in analyzing Trump's campaign tax plan last year, estimated that the plan could add around $6 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. However, approximately one-third of this deficit impact could be offset by economic growth, leaving about $400 billion per year in additional debt.\n\nTo address this issue, potential spending cuts have been suggested. The Government Accountability Office's 2017 study of duplication and fragmentation identified at least $20 billion in potential savings per year. Past estimates by former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn have been as high as $95 billion per year. Assuming a conservative total of $25 billion year or $250 billion over a decade in savings, this would help offset a portion of the tax reform's impact on the national debt.\n\nFurther savings could be found in the Pentagon, where an internal report, initially buried, found administrative waste that could be reduced by $125 billion over a 5-year period without requiring layoffs or personnel reductions. Additionally, there is an estimated $25 billion per year in savings from the country's biggest discretionary department.\n\nImproper government payments, totaling $144 billion for fiscal year 2016, also present an opportunity for savings. Most of this is overpayments by Medicare and Medicaid, along with other programs like federal education grants and the EITC.\n\nWhile spending cuts are not without controversy, focusing on eliminating duplicative programs, self-identified waste, and improper payments could help offset a significant portion of the tax reform's impact on the national debt. The potential savings identified so far total just under $200 billion, assuming no increases since 2016.\n\nIt is important to note that no spending cut is easy, as every dollar in waste has its own interest group advocating for its preservation. However, the fact that a few items can account for as much as half of the shortfall from a massive tax cut suggests that focusing on spending cuts is a viable option for policymakers.\n\nIf Republicans believe that cutting duplicative programs, self-identified waste, and improper payments is not politically possible or not worth fighting for, they may want to question their purpose in Washington.",
    " Title: Midterm Election Results Show Democratic Gains, Challenges for Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe midterm elections of 2018 have resulted in a significant shift in power, with Democrats making substantial gains in the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as in various state-level positions. As of the latest count, the Democratic Party has gained at least 35 seats in the House, with the possibility of this number reaching 40 as the remaining close races are settled.\n\nIn the Senate, the Democratic Party has flipped a second seat from red to blue with Kyrsten Sinema's victory in the Arizona race, following the earlier win of Jacky Rosen in Nevada. This shift solidifies the Democratic takeover of the House and keeps the Republican Senate majority thin.\n\nDemocrats have also taken over at least seven governors' mansions, won back majorities in eight state legislative chambers, and flipped at least 329 state legislative seats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, commented on the results, stating, \"The more time that passes since Election Day, the better things keep looking for Democrats.\" He boasted about his party's \"Women of the West\" \u2013 Sens.-elect Sinema and Rosen.\n\nIn Florida, the results of the Senate and Governor's races are still uncertain due to ongoing recounts. As of Tuesday, Republican Governor Rick Scott led Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson by more than 12,500 votes, or 0.15 percent of the roughly 8.2 million votes cast. In the Governor's race, Republican Ron DeSantis had a 33,000-vote advantage over Democrat Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.\n\nPresident Trump initially declared the midterms a Republican success, stating that they \"defied history\" with Senate gains. However, the current Senate pickups are likely to be one or two, rather than the four or more initially suggested.\n\nDemocratic strategist Brad Bannon commented, \"If the GOP has many more'victories' like this, it will go the way of the Whigs.\" The White House did not respond to questions about the growing Democratic wins.\n\nThe Republican losses in the midterms are less severe than the 63 Democratic House seats and seven Democratic Senate seats lost by President Obama in his first midterm, which he called a \"shellacking.\" However, the setbacks this year still sting for the president and congressional Republicans.\n\nChris Grant, founder of the Republican consulting firm Big Dog Strategies in Buffalo, described the election as \"a tough night all around\" for the party. He attributed the Democratic success partly to candidates raising more money through ActBlue, a fundraising platform that allowed small-dollar donors to give to a variety of Democratic candidates across the nation.\n\nGrant suggested that the Trump presidential campaign's focus on small-dollar donors in 2016 could benefit Republicans in 2020 as President Trump seeks re-election. He also noted that the lessons learned from the 2018 midterms could help Republicans in the 2020 presidential race.",
    " Title: Senate Fails to Advance Chuck Hagel's Defense Secretary Nomination Due to Filibuster\n\nArticle:\n\nThursday marked a significant development in the ongoing saga of Chuck Hagel's nomination as President Obama's second-term defense secretary. The nomination fell two votes short of the required 60 in the Senate, which would have allowed it to proceed to a final vote. The vote, largely along party lines, was 58 to 40 with one senator voting present.\n\nFour Republicans joined Democrats in voting to end debate and proceed to a final vote. They were Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) expressed disappointment, stating, \"Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, it gets worse.\" Reid plans to schedule another procedural vote for the week after next to try to advance Hagel's nomination to a final vote.\n\nThe debate over Hagel's nomination has been labeled as the first time a defense secretary has had their nomination stalled in such a manner. Republicans, however, insist they have not filibustered the nomination. Instead, they argue that they are seeking more time to have additional questions answered.\n\nInitially, it appeared that while many Republicans would vote against Hagel's confirmation, no one would actively try to block it. However, the situation has since escalated, with Senate Republicans requesting answers to questions about speeches Hagel has given since leaving the Senate in 2009, as well as inquiries about his financial dealings. Senate Democrats argue these questions are unwarranted.\n\nIn the aftermath of the filibuster, Senate Republicans have expanded the questions they want answered before allowing a vote on Hagel's nomination. Some of these questions concern an issue unrelated to Hagel: the September 11, 2012, Benghazi attack on the U.S. Consulate and its aftermath, which led to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nThe Democrats who control the Senate have 55 votes they can count on, a number that includes the Senate's two independents. Two Republicans have also stated they will vote for Hagel, Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Thad Cochran of Mississippi. However, this still leaves Reid three votes short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster. The source of the remaining three votes remains unclear.\n\nEven Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the closest thing to a moderate in the Senate Republican caucus, stated on Wednesday that she would be voting against Hagel. If the Hagel nomination is not confirmed, the president would be left with two options: finding a nominee more acceptable to Senate Republicans or adopting a John Paul Jones approach, telling Senate Republicans he has not yet begun to fight and sending them another nominee who would provoke their opposition.",

However, the officials did not provide details on how they arrived at this conclusion.\n\nThe hearings have been criticized for potentially being used to undermine the election, as per the Russians' intentions. The hearings followed the release of emails containing sensitive information from the DNC, which exposed various issues within the Democratic Party.\n\nThe hearings also addressed the long-term cyberattacks on the United States by not only Russia but also China, Iran, and other adversaries. The ineffectiveness of the efforts taken by President Obama and his national security team to thwart these damaging intrusions was highlighted.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, a failed vice-presidential candidate, was criticized for his attempts to make light of the situation during the hearing, with his comments falling flat. Kaine took aim at President-elect Donald Trump and his new security team, as well as complaining about \"fake news.\"\n\nJames Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, was a key figure in the hearings. Clapper has been criticized for his past dishonesty, including lying about the National Security Agency (NSA) collecting data on millions of Americans during a 2013 hearing. During the hearing, Clapper attempted to differentiate between hacking into American email systems and the use of that information to supposedly influence the election, a political question outside of his area of expertise.\n\nThe hearings also touched on the Obama administration's failure to punish foreign entities for their cyber espionage against the United States. Clapper defended this failure, stating, \"I was a bit reticent... You know, people that live in glass houses shouldn't publicly throw too many rocks.\" This comment was seen as a reflection of the Obama administration's approach to international relations, known as the \"Glass House Doctrine.\" This doctrine suggests that the United States is just another country in a world of struggling nations, with nothing unique or exceptional to offer.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Aids Oil Industry Facing Economic Impact of Coronavirus\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump announced on Friday that the Department of Energy would purchase crude oil for the nation's strategic petroleum reserve, aiming to support the oil industry that has been struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic. The move is expected to save taxpayers \"billions and billions of dollars\" while helping an industry in crisis.\n\nOil prices increased nearly 5% following the announcement, but this was only a fraction of the amount lost earlier in the week. In South Texas, Rudy Martinez, who rents rooms to out-of-town oilfield workers, has experienced the effects of the recent collapse in crude oil prices.\n\n\"I actually have a little man camp, and these guys are on the way out because they lost contracts,\" Martinez said. He added that the workers' per-diem payments and his weekly rental fees have decreased significantly due to the current economic situation.\n\nBefore the oil business downturn, Martinez could charge up to $2000 a week per person. This is just one example of the impact declining oil prices have on rural communities that rely on the oil industry. The United States, the world's largest producer of crude oil, stands to lose a lot if oil prices remain low.\n\nOil prices had been falling due to fears that the coronavirus epidemic could threaten global economic growth and decreased demand as large gatherings were canceled and people stayed home to avoid getting sick. The situation worsened last Sunday when Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on production cuts, leading to a price war. In a surprising turn of events, Saudi Arabia announced it would increase oil production and offer substantial discounts to its customers.\n\nU.S. oil companies, particularly smaller ones, are now considering significant cuts. Industry analysts warn of potential bankruptcies, especially if oil remains in the $30 per barrel range. Companies operating in Texas's Eagle Ford Shale need prices between $40 to $60 a barrel to remain profitable.\n\nKarnes City, Texas, was transformed by the oil drilling boom that began about a decade ago. Karnes County National Bank President Trip Ruckman recalls local farmers and ranchers who were barely getting by, only to suddenly receive large oil royalty checks. Although the town still appears busy with trucks on the roads and a few local hotels still full, Ruckman anticipates a slowdown in activity within a few weeks to a month or two.\n\nThere have been reports that the Trump administration may offer additional aid to the oil industry, such as reducing federal royalties for oil pumped on government land or offshore, or providing low-interest government-backed loans. However, environmental groups, like Greenpeace, have expressed opposition to such measures.\n\nOne potential positive outcome of the current situation is lower gasoline prices for motorists in the coming months. However, with many limiting travel due to coronavirus concerns, increased consumption, as typically occurs when gas prices decrease, may not occur this time.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee Releases Bipartisan Report on Benghazi Attacks, Blames Obama Administration for Security Failures\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, released on Wednesday, has attributed the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, to a series of failures by the Obama administration. The report, which is the result of a long-delayed investigation, lays out more than a dozen findings regarding the assaults on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012, on the diplomatic compound and a CIA annex in Benghazi.\n\nThe report states that the State Department failed to increase security at the sites despite warnings, and faults intelligence agencies for not sharing information about the existence of the CIA outpost with the U.S. military. The committee determined that the U.S. military command in Africa didn't know about the CIA annex and didn't have the resources to defend the diplomatic compound in an emergency.\n\nThe report specifies that four Al-Qaeda-linked groups participated in the attacks: Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar al-Sharia, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and the Mohammad Jamal Network.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee's assessment comes on the heels of a Fox News report re-confirming that U.S. officials knew that the Benghazi attacks were acts of terrorism within minutes. The report also notes that the State Department ignored or rejected requests for more security from its own ambassador, failed to heed security warnings, and lacked intelligence analysis post-attack, showing an \"unsettling\" lack of concern.\n\nThe report also alleges that the Obama administration unnecessarily hampered the committee's review, and Republican committee members' notes go further, accusing the administration of still withholding relevant documentation. The Senate Intelligence Committee's assessment comes amidst a series of developments, including the State Department knowingly renewing its lease on the Benghazi compound without sufficient security in July 2012 and declining to renew a Defense Department security team that departed the country one month before Amb. Stevens was assassinated, and rejecting an offer of a Marine detachment. These are an awful lot of developments for a \"phony scandal,\" the report suggests.",
    " Title: Global Stocks Plummet to Three-Year Low as Coronavirus Cases Surpass 200,000\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a volatile trading session on Wednesday, global stocks plunged to a three-year low as the worldwide cases of the coronavirus surpassed 200,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 1,300 points, settling below the psychologically-important level of 20,000, marking its lowest close since February 2017 and entering bear market territory. The S&P 500 also plummeted, triggering a market-wide temporary halt to trading before closing down by over 5% on the day.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 crisis has prompted governments worldwide to consider stimulus measures and stringent restrictions to curb the virus's spread. However, the economic fallout is already being felt, with several indicators deteriorating sharply. Wall Street predicts a recession this year, with JPMorgan Chase economist Bruce Kasman stating, \"There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to keep investors on edge, as one major economy after another shuts its borders to stem the outbreak and considers measures to combat the financial and economic disaster that COVID-19 is leaving in its wake. The Trump administration is working on a fiscal stimulus package to counter the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the stimulus likely to exceed $1 trillion. The Senate approved a bill on Wednesday that would provide for sick leave, expanded job benefits, and coronavirus testing.\n\nMonetary policymakers also stepped in with further stimulus on Tuesday. In a move anticipated by many market participants, the Federal Reserve announced the relaunching of its financial crisis-era Commercial Paper Funding Facility, a program designed to help U.S. companies gain increased access to financing amid the pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nVolatility stemming from the outbreak has seen the Dow move up or down by 1,000 points or more for 8 straight days, and 11 times in the last month, according to Yahoo Finance data.",
    " Title: Bill Clinton Advocates for Honoring Health Insurance Promises, but Obama's Promise is Unfulfillable\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton has suggested that President Barack Obama should honor his commitment to allow Americans to keep their health insurance plans, despite the latter's infamous promise that has been proven false. In an interview with Ozy.com, Clinton stated, \"I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to these people and let them keep what they got.\"\n\nClinton's statement carries weight, given his reputation for verbal dexterity and his history of dissembling under oath, which led to the suspension of his law license. However, the problem with Clinton's advice is that Obama's promise on insurance was not only an injudicious statement, but one that was impossible to fulfill.\n\nThe promise ran counter to the central premise of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). People losing their current insurance is not an unintended consequence of the law; it is an intended consequence without which much of the law doesn't work. In essence, Obama's lie runs so deep that even Clinton, who had his law license suspended for dissembling under oath, may not fully comprehend its implications.\n\nThe Obama administration's posture is that the president is sorry for misleading people and wants them to keep their coverage, but it just can't be done without unraveling a key element of Obamacare. The White House's strategy is based on spin and muddling through, hoping to brazen it out and come up with administrative \"fixes\" to the problem of cancellations. The politics of Obamacare are becoming increasingly toxic due to the immediate and concrete costs, such as canceled policies and higher premiums, which are more politically significant than the promise of a direct benefit.",

In a series of tweets, she expressed concern over the reported tax breaks the company will receive and described the local community's reaction to the news as \"outrage.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez's position on Amazon may distance her from some of the state's top Democrats, including Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who have been involved in negotiations over the deal. The Democrat's stance may further cement her status as an outsider among New York's establishment Democrats, many of whom endorsed Joe Crowley, the longtime incumbent House member she unseated in the Democratic primary.\n\nOcasio-Cortez criticized the tax breaks reportedly offered by the state's economic development arm, Empire State Development. She suggested they may come at the expense of critical pieces of the city's infrastructure, such as its mass transit and public housing, which face billions of dollars in repair needs.\n\n\"Amazon is a billion-dollar company,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted late Monday night. \"The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\"\n\nAmazon's split decision means the selected locations can expect to share as many as 50,000 jobs and roughly $5 billion in investment. New York and Arlington, Virginia's Crystal City neighborhood won the Amazon competition, beating out places including Newark, New Jersey, Boston, and Austin, Texas. Ocasio-Cortez's district includes parts of Queens adjacent to Long Island City, including Sunnyside and parts of Astoria.\n\nState and local officials are expected to make an official announcement on Tuesday, a source with knowledge of the plans told \u2588\u2588\u2588 late Monday.\n\nOcasio-Cortez stated that the deal must include substantial benefits for the surrounding community, which is home to the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing project in the country.\n\n\"We need to focus on good healthcare, living wages, affordable rent. Corporations that offer none of those things should be met with skepticism,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \"It's possible to establish economic partnerships with real opportunities for working families, instead of a race-to-the-bottom competition.\"\n\n\"Lastly, this isn't just about one company or one headquarters,\" she said in a tweet sent Tuesday shortly after midnight. \"It's about cost of living, corps paying their fair share, etc. It's not about picking a fight, either. I was elected to advocate for our community's interests\u2014& they've requested, clearly, to voice their concerns.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, 29, is set to become the youngest member of Congress when she's inaugurated next year following her upset victory over Crowley.",
    " Title: Frustration Mounts as Jeb Bush Struggles in New Hampshire Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary, frustration within the Bush family's political circle has become increasingly apparent, with some supporters acknowledging that it may soon be time for Jeb Bush to exit the race. The former Florida governor trails Marco Rubio in polls, and there is a growing sense that he is running out of time to demonstrate strength.\n\nMany donors and influential supporters, bound by a deep and longstanding connection to the Bush family, say they will remain with Bush as long as he is in the race. However, others, distressed by the rise of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and eager for the Republican Party to rally around a mainstream candidate with viability, say they have come to terms with Bush's long odds and the possibility they will eventually support someone else.\n\nVin Weber, a Jeb Bush adviser who also worked on George W. Bush's presidential campaigns, said, \"I acknowledge reality. There's going to be three or four candidates remaining after New Hampshire.\" He added, \"We'll see what happens in South Carolina, and from there you can see the dynamic starting to winnow the field pretty quickly.\"\n\nBarring a strong showing in New Hampshire, some top Bush fundraisers and supporters say Wednesday could be a day of deep reflection for them. One top Bush fundraiser who played a key role in his brother's administration said, \"If he doesn't do well in New Hampshire, I think he needs to think long and hard about what he wants to do.\"\n\nWhile Bush's top aides are still struggling to keep restless supporters in line, there is still some reason for optimism. If recent polls are to be believed, Bush has climbed to within striking distance of second place, putting him in a head-to-head competition with his chief rival, Rubio. Bush might have more upside after Saturday night, when he emerged relatively unscathed from the GOP debate while Rubio stumbled under a barrage of attacks, largely from Chris Christie.\n\nHowever, Bush's top aides are still struggling to keep restless supporters in line. On Thursday, three days after the former governor barely registered in the Iowa caucuses, the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise held a conference call with top donors to outline the path forward. At one point, Mike Murphy, a longtime top Bush adviser who oversees Right to Rise, was pressed by a donor on why the super PAC's substantial spending had yet to improve the former governor's poll numbers.\n\nFor Bush's supporters, the question of whether to desert him is a complicated one. Bush's network of loyal donors and political supporters is far more extensive than that of any of his rivals. The ties between them and the Bush family, to which many remain deeply indebted, are strong and long-lasting. This weekend, dozens of longtime Bush family friends and supporters from across the country descended on New Hampshire to trudge through the snow and knock on doors.\n\nIf some backers do begin to walk away, it could alter the trajectory of the campaign. The former governor, who has raised well over $120 million, has a deep well of donors who could go on to fill another contender's coffers. To date, Bush has lost relatively few high-profile contributors. One exception came in November when Brian Ballard, a top Florida-based fundraiser, announced he was ditching the campaign over disagreements over strategy.\n\nSome say they are hesitant to leave Bush because there is a growing sense that he has no intention of departing the race soon. He has said publicly to supporters and privately to senior aides that he will fight on to South Carolina and his team has begun planning a campaign event there with George W. Bush. His campaign is getting ready to send a bus of Bush loyalists from Washington, D.C. to South Carolina.\n\nTo many of Bush's closest followers, the thought of him dropping out is almost unthinkable, particularly if Rubio emerges as the leading establishment candidate. Among Bush's top advisers, the dislike of Rubio, who for years was a junior figure to Bush in Florida politics and is seen as deeply disloyal, is intense. One top Bush fundraiser said that on conference calls with the campaign, Rubio has been called \"Judas,\" a reference to the biblical figure who had betrayed Jesus.\n\nHowever, with the governor struggling, some, for all their feelings of closeness to the family, hint that they are beginning to think about the possibility of a 2016 campaign without him. Francis Rooney, who served as an ambassador under George W. Bush and has been a major donor to Jeb Bush's campaign, said, \"Sooner or later the process is going to unfold, and we'll see who gains traction.\"\n\nAt times in recent weeks, the gloomy outlook in the campaign has been interrupted by moments of humor. Shortly after kicking off the Right to Rise conference call last week, Mike Murphy introduced himself to listeners and began his initial remarks. Then, he was suddenly interrupted. \"Ah, f--- you,\" one person on the line blurted out. There was silence. Those on the call wondered: Was a frustrated donor, unhappy about Bush's lagging poll numbers and his crushing defeat in Iowa, directing venom toward Murphy? (As it turned out, the expletive-using caller was none other than Charlie Spies, the veteran Republican election attorney who represents Right to Rise. Spies had been cut off by a driver and had forgotten to turn on his mute button, though at the time the listeners on the call \u2013 and Murphy \u2013 didn't know that.)",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Vow to Reverse Obama's Foreign Policy Achievements in 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 U.S. presidential election, foreign policy has emerged as a significant issue, with several Republican candidates vowing to reverse key foreign policy achievements of President Barack Obama. This has led to comparisons with the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have consistently pledged to repeal.\n\nDuring Obama's second term, the administration has been working to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in over half a century and negotiating a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Several GOP presidential contenders, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), have vowed to reverse these policies if elected.\n\nSen. Rubio, who announced his presidential campaign on Monday at Miami's Freedom Tower, a symbolic location for Cuban exiles, is a fierce critic of Cuba's government and U.S. relations with it. When asked if he would re-break diplomatic relations with Cuba if elected, Rubio responded, \"Absolutely.\" He expressed a desire for \"free and fair elections\" in Cuba and stated that U.S. policy can provide \"major leverage.\"\n\nRegarding Iran, Rubio contends that any agreements made by one president can be undone by the next. He suggested that if elected, he would re-impose sanctions, even if other world powers and the United Nations failed to follow suit. Such a move could lead to a new confrontation with Iran.\n\nThe possibility of such dramatic foreign policy reversals raises questions about the feasibility of these actions. A president can break diplomatic relations with Cuba, even if they've just been restored. However, supporters of Obama's Cuba policy expect a different dynamic, with the U.S. opening to Cuba potentially bringing economic opportunities.\n\nIn theory, a president could also tear up an agreement made by their predecessor. However, the legality of such actions is contested, with Iran's foreign minister insisting that an agreement would be binding and withdrawal would be a \"blatant violation of international law.\"\n\nObama has been critical of the Republican candidates' foreign policy proposals, describing them as \"foolish\" ideas that would undermine the presidency. The election's outcome may not hinge on foreign policy, but the issue is generating significant discussion among candidates and the public. Republicans are running against the retiring president's foreign policy legacy, providing one last opportunity to critique Obama's policies.",
    " Title: A Neutral Analysis of the Debate on Gun Control in Light of Recent Mass Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest in modern U.S. history, has sparked renewed discussions on gun control. This article aims to present a neutral analysis of the arguments for and against stricter gun laws in the context of this tragedy.\n\nTo resist calls for more or tougher gun laws or enforcement in the wake of tragedies like Las Vegas, one must first accept that existing laws and regulations may not reliably prevent such crimes as long as guns exist. The new or expanded national gun control laws advocated as sensible and necessary would have had no effect on the Las Vegas shooting, even if perfectly enforced, as Jacob Sullum explained at Reason earlier today.\n\nOne argument for stricter gun laws is the prevalence of gun-related crimes. In Nevada, over the course of three years prior to 2017, rifles were used in murders four known times, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. However, Nevada's figures show an unusually large number of gun murders where the type of gun used is unknown. If we assume the ratio of handgun to rifle murders is similar for known and unknown gun types, we should add 20 more rifle murders, for a total of 24 in the three-year period. This larger number represents 4% of total murders in Nevada over that three-year period. Killers used hands or fists to murder 25 times during that same period.\n\nWith its \"lax\" gun laws, Nevada saw 67% of its murders committed with a gun last year. This is one percentage point lower than the 68% for the country as a whole in 2016.\n\nAnother argument against stricter gun laws is the belief that some individuals are bizarre and horrific outliers who can and do horrible things. However, noticing how rare are such events, despite the millions of rifles out there, might give one pause when imagining a national legal solution to such bizarre individual crimes.\n\nGuns are not the only tools that allow an evil maniac to cause so much harm. The driver of the truck that produced 84 casualties in 2016 in Nice, France, shows this. Legal solutions short of bans are largely irrelevant to these sorts of crimes.\n\nThe unwillingness to leap to a legal solution to mass gun murders requires recognizing that guns are tools, with genuine uses for personal safety, personal fulfillment, and convenience, just as are cars. A tiny number of people who own or have access to these specific tools ever use them to harm another human.\n\nSome people do not see getting rid of guns as a proportionate response to the actual demonstrated threat of rifles, even post-Las Vegas America. One reason is the threat of severe civic unrest if the U.S. government attempted a mass confiscation, even with the promise of an absurdly expensive buyback, of that many almost universally legally and peacefully owned weapons.\n\nVast harm can come to individuals and communities from ultimately futile attempts to extirpate such things. One might consider how police, who would be the confiscators, behave, especially in America's poorest and least-respected communities. What might it be like unleashing them on a contraband potentially lethal to them?\n\nYou might disagree with these value judgments and assessments of proportionality, but a failure to fall back on a legal solution to mass gun murder events is a plausibly reasonable understanding of the extent and proportion of the problem weapons cause versus the costs in civic peace and innocent lives damaged.\n\nFor the vast majority of their owners, guns are no more worthy of banning than any other element of their peacefully enjoyed liberty, one tool among many to shape their chosen life and leisure. Banning something that tens of millions of people innocently value and imposing onerous costs on American citizens, generally downward in socioeconomic terms, is a recipe for disaster. There is intellectual room to understand and internalize the pain and damage that weapons can cause in the hands of an evil maniac, yet still sincerely believe that any effective legal solution is either impossible or requires an unacceptable level of police interference into innocent lives.",
    " Title: US-China Emissions Agreement: A Significant Political Step, But Falls Short of 2-Degree Target\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2009, the United States pledged to reduce its emissions by 30% compared to 2005 levels by 2025, following the Copenhagen Accord. The agreement was met with criticism and was labeled a failure by many. Fast forward to today, the US, in an \"historic\" agreement with China, has committed to cutting emissions by less than that, with a target of 26-28% by the same date. This new agreement, however, has been met with cheers rather than boos.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant moment as China, for the first time, has named a date when their emissions will peak. The Chinese government has promised not just to peak their emissions by 2030 but to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in their energy mix to 20% by the same date. Interestingly, a report from analysts GlobalData suggested that China is already on course to get 20% of its energy from greener sources by 2020.\n\nThe agreement, while significant in terms of China's commitment to cap its emissions, is not seen as a game-changer in terms of global warming. \"This does not put us on a pathway to 2 degrees,\" said Samantha Smith from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). \"This announcement is a political signal from these two countries. If we understand it as a signal, it is a good thing and it is a first for China to stand up and say it will cap its emissions.\"\n\nThe China-US step has received a muted welcome from the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), a group of countries facing threats from rising sea levels. \"We look forward to more detailed information about how the commitments match up against what is needed to ensure a safe global climate,\" the Aosis ministers said in a statement. \"We recognize the importance of bilateral cooperation between these two countries, but the numbers must add up.\"\n\nThe real significance of the US-China deal lies in the changes it signals in the United Nations political process. Every nation has committed to agreeing a new deal by the time the parties gather in Paris next year. Next month, the negotiators will meet in Peru to draft the text of that agreement.\n\nThe Beijing deal is significant because it underlines the fact that China is changing its position. \"It signals a shift,\" according to Liz Gallagher from environmental think-tank E3G. \"At the highest level, there is a recognition that China is not a deeply poor society and that they are distinct from other developing countries.\"\n\nThe deal should also put pressure on some developed countries who have been moving away from tackling emissions. \"The ball is in play, so now others, not just developing countries but the likes of Japan, Canada, and Australia, there is now pressure on them to come forward with something themselves,\" said Samantha Smith.\n\nTaken together with the EU's recent announcement of new climate targets for 2030, one could be forgiven for thinking that a deal in Paris is in the bag. However, cutting emissions is just one part of the negotiations, and for many countries, the least important bit. For many, the bigger questions are about cash to cope with the impact of climate change. Many nations want a financial mechanism that would put a legal responsibility on those who have done most to cause climate change to compensate those who suffer most from it. This is a potential iceberg for the whole process.",
    " Title: One-Third of U.S. Voters Unaware of Their Congressional Candidates, Poll Finds\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos has revealed that approximately one-third of registered voters in the United States are unaware of the names of their party's candidates for Congress in their respective districts. This finding, published less than five weeks before the midterm elections, highlights the importance of name recognition in motivating voters.\n\nThe poll, conducted between September 24-30, surveyed 2,597 registered voters and had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. According to the poll, 34% of Republican registered voters and 32.5% of Democratic registered voters did not know the names of their party's congressional candidates.\n\nProfessor Robert Erikson of Columbia University in New York City suggests that the current level of party polarization in the U.S. may lead voters to base their decisions on their feelings towards President Donald Trump rather than the local candidates.\n\nIn terms of party affiliation, 54% of U.S. adults surveyed disapprove of the way Trump is handling the presidency, and Democrats currently hold a 9 percentage point lead in a generic question on which party they expect to vote for in Congress. Democrats need to win 23 seats in the House to secure a majority, which they could use to more effectively oppose Trump's agenda.\n\nBeyond party and name recognition, gender may also play a role in voters' decisions this year, according to Michael Cornfield, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University. The #MeToo movement and protests surrounding Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have contributed to this trend.\n\n\"In these cases, it's not just the name,\" Cornfield said in an email. \"Gender relations may be the top issue.\"\n\nThe poll's findings suggest that name recognition may be a critical factor in motivating voters, but the current political climate and the role of gender in voters' decisions could also significantly impact the midterm elections.",
    " Title: Trump Endorses Cruz in Texas Senate Race, Praises Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally in Houston on Monday, President Donald Trump endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz for re-election in the upcoming midterm elections. Trump described Cruz as \"a really good friend of mine\" and emphasized the importance of maintaining the Republican majority in the Senate to pass key legislation, such as the proposed border wall.\n\nThe event, which was moved to a larger arena due to high demand, attracted a boisterous crowd. According to Trump's campaign, over 100,000 people expressed interest in the free tickets for the event, although the Toyota Arena, which holds 18,000, was not at capacity during the rally.\n\nWhile polls show Cruz with a comfortable lead over his Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, many attendees expressed that they had come to see Trump rather than Cruz. One attendee, Rick LaBlanc, a retired oil industry executive, stated, \"I do like Ted Cruz a lot but I'm here to see Donald Trump. I'm a Trump man.\"\n\nThe last Democrat to win a statewide race in Texas was in 1994. The Democratic Party has long hoped to capitalize on shifting demographics in urban areas, while Republicans have relied on Texas as a solid block across the south and southwest.\n\nCruz's opponent, Beto O'Rourke, has made a notable impression on voters with his campaign, raising $38.1 million in the three-month Federal Election Commission reporting period that ended on September 30, a record for a Senate candidate.\n\nTrump described O'Rourke as \"a radical, open borders left-winger,\" while Cruz labeled O'Rourke as a \"gun-grabbing liberal.\" O'Rourke has expressed support for impeaching Trump and has advocated for relaxed immigration policies and gun control.\n\nCruz and Trump exchanged bitter insults during the 2016 presidential campaign, but their relationship has improved since Trump took office. Cruz has been an outspoken advocate for Trump's efforts to crackdown on immigration, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and nominate conservative judges to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump praised Cruz for his role in the recent Supreme Court battle, stating, \"We had our little difficulties, but actually if you remember in the beginning it was a lovefest...then it got nasty. And then it ended, and I'll tell you what nobody has helped me more.\"",
    " Title: Alabama Rejects Federal Plan to House Coronavirus-Positive Cruise Ship Passengers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed a plan to house some American passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was stuck in Japan due to the coronavirus outbreak, at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama. However, state officials have rejected the plan, potentially causing authorities to shelve the idea.\n\nAs of Sunday night, the global death toll from the virus surpassed 2,600, with over 79,000 confirmed cases. The U.S. has 35 confirmed cases. The HHS plan called for the FEMA Center in Anniston to serve as a quarantine center for passengers with minor or no symptoms. Those who become seriously ill would be taken to pre-identified hospitals, according to HHS.\n\nThe plan received a swift and negative response from Alabama's mayor, governor, and multiple congressmen. Representative Bradley Byrne stated on Twitter, \"The people of Alabama DO NOT want the coronavirus brought here.\" He added, \"I\u2019m fighting to bring this to a full stop. Leave these people in the place they came from, don\u2019t spread them around the US, and keep them OUT of Alabama. The risk is much too high.\"\n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers claimed he had spoken with President Donald Trump, who Rogers said agreed that the HHS plan was the \"wrong decision.\" Governor Kay Ivey stated that the HHS announcement was \"inadvertently, and perhaps prematurely, sent.\" She clarified that Anniston was being considered only as a backup plan and no decision had been made to send anyone to Anniston.\n\nWorldwide, South Korea reported its sixth and seventh coronavirus deaths and announced that cases have surpassed 760. President Moon Jae-in raised the virus alert level to red, the highest in its four-tier system, for the first time in more than a decade. Schools that were supposed to open in a week will be delayed until March 9.\n\nIn China, President Xi Jinping pledged unrelenting efforts to control the outbreak that has killed over 2,400 of his countrymen. \"The epidemic situation remains grim and complex,\" Xi told state media. More than 77,000 of the infection cases are in mainland China. The silver lining is that over 24,000 of those patients have been confirmed as \"totally recovered.\"\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani of Iran issued a decree setting up a national committee for managing the epidemic, which has killed eight people in the country \u2013 the highest death toll outside China. Another 43 cases have been confirmed. Cultural centers, schools, and universities in 14 provinces were ordered closed, and Turkey closed its border with Iran.

Greenwald expressed his surprise at the apparent short-sightedness of Obama supporters, who, despite their reservations about a potential future president, do not urge the current administration to limit executive power.\n\nGreenwald pointed out an apparent contradiction in the stance of some Obama supporters, who express concern about the president's policies but remain silent on the issue of executive power. He cited examples of Obama's policies, such as the secret kill list, which have raised concerns among some, yet are met with acceptance by others.\n\nGreenwald also criticized the lack of concern from some Republicans regarding Obama's policies, despite their vocal opposition to other aspects of his administration. He cited examples such as Sarah Palin's criticism of Obama's Medicare treatment review board, while remaining silent on the president's literal death panel that has resulted in the deaths of American citizens.\n\nGreenwald urged voters to focus on the issue of executive power and the potential dangers of granting such powers to any administration, regardless of political affiliation. He emphasized the need to defeat Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, due to their perceived bellicose and malign nature, but also acknowledged that the current administration has set precedents that could be inherited by a future administration.\n\nFinally, Greenwald addressed the issue of privilege and the ability to write about certain issues.

With just a few days left before the election, the Romney campaign is facing challenges in gaining media attention.\n\nTom Rath, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, stated, \"It interrupted the news cycle at a time when there were favorable horse race stories for Mitt. In a campaign, you do not get to design the racetrack; you play the cards you're dealt.\"\n\nRomney has responded to the storm by collecting donated food in Ohio, calling for donations to the American Red Cross, and sending out messages of sympathy. However, his efforts have not received the same level of attention as President Obama, who has been touring New Jersey with Republican Governor Chris Christie, who has praised Obama's handling of the disaster.\n\nWilliam Schneider, a senior fellow at Third Way, a centrist think tank, commented, \"It's going to be a little harder for [Romney] to argue that this is a failed presidency, because the president appears to have performed well in this crisis.\"\n\nDavid Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University, stated, \"I don't see a rallying-around-the-president effect.\" He also noted that the storm is unlikely to reshape the electoral map, as the worst of the destruction occurred in northeastern states that were considered certain to vote for Obama.\n\nSpeaking strictly in terms of media attention, the storm is a dominant event that may take several days to play out before the focus returns to the presidential election. David Carney, a Republican consultant, suggested that voters have already made up their minds and that a strong closing argument from a candidate or increased media coverage may not change the eventual outcome.\n\nRath, the Romney adviser, suggested that voters are invested in the presidential race and will make their choices known, regardless of the shape and coverage of any final campaign sprint. \"Everybody is overwhelmed and moved by the pictures, which are compelling beyond measure, but at the end of the day, they'll think, 'We've got to vote,'\" Rath said. \"The American people are going to say, after putting up with this race for 18 months, 'It's time for me to make my decision.'\"",
    " Title: Delay in GOP Lawsuit Against President Obama Over Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans' announced lawsuit against President Barack Obama over the implementation of the Obamacare law has yet to be filed four months after the initial announcement, despite being expected to take place in September. The suit, which alleges that the president exceeded his constitutional authority by failing to implement certain provisions of the law, was intended as a rallying point for aggrieved Republicans during the election season.\n\nLawyers close to the process initially expected the legal challenge to be filed in September, but now they do not expect any action before the elections. Some attribute the delay to electoral politics, suggesting that Republicans were concerned that filing the suit could rile up the Democratic base. However, the GOP has remained silent on the reasons for the delay.\n\nThe delay means the core of the suit could be moot before the Obama administration even responds to it in court. The case was expected to center on an employer mandate provision that Obama twice delayed but is now set to kick in for many employers on Jan. 1.\n\nFormer House Counsel Stan Brand, a Democrat, questioned the seriousness of the lawsuit, stating, \"I thought this was a constitutional crisis and the republic was in jeopardy because Obama overstepped his bounds. Now, they can\u2019t even get around to filing it?\"\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said the date for filing the litigation remains up in the air. \"No decisions on timing at this point,\" spokesman Kevin Smith said Friday. He declined to comment on speculation about the reasons for the delay.\n\nSome Democrats suspect the filing has been delayed because Boehner's announcement of the suit over the summer backfired to some extent, spurring fundraising by Democratic committees. Raising the issue again so close to the election could agitate those in the president's base who view such a lawsuit as disrespectful and part of an effort to delegitimize Obama.\n\nDemocratic consultant David DiMartino argued that the delay could push an even wider swath of the country away from the GOP. \"I think it goes beyond the Democratic base in terms of the Americans who thought this was beyond the pale,\" he said. \"Republican leaders are really good at finding really efficient ways to alienate huge swaths of the American public, and this is one of those issues.\"\n\nSome conservatives, however, see the suit's postponement until after the election as important to rebutting charges that it's only about politics. Todd Gaziano of the Pacific Legal Foundation stated, \"After the election, it ought to garner more serious commentary, evaluation, and judicial review. It can have some very helpful consequences for a principle that I think liberals and conservatives should both be concerned about, and that is the president's unilateral authority to rewrite a statute in dozens of ways.\"",
    " Title: Pentagon to Allow Transgender Recruits as Court Orders Military to Accept Them\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Defense has confirmed that it will allow transgender individuals to enlist in the military starting January 1, 2023, following a federal court order. This decision comes despite opposition from President Trump, who announced a ban on transgender servicemembers via Twitter in the summer of 2017.\n\nLast year, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban on transgender service members, allowing them to serve openly in the military. He stated that within 12 months, transgender people would also be able to enlist. However, President Trump's tweet in July 2017 stated that the federal government \"will not accept or allow\" transgender troops to serve \"in any capacity\" in the military.\n\nThe new policy sets a strict set of physical, medical, and mental conditions that potential transgender recruits must meet to join the armed services. The Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition, and those who have undergone reconstruction. However, such recruits are allowed if a medical provider certifies they have been clinically stable in their preferred gender for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy also must be stable on their medication for 18 months. Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, stated that the enlistment of transgender recruits will start on January 1 and will proceed amid the legal battles. The Defense Department is also studying the issue.\n\nThe government's decision was quickly challenged in court, and two U.S. district court judges have already ruled against the ban. Part of one ruling required the government to allow transgender individuals to enlist beginning January 1.\n\nThe Justice Department spokeswoman, Lauren Ehrsam, told Fox News, \"We disagree with the Court's ruling and are seeking to stay the Defense Department's obligations under that ruling as we evaluate next steps. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons, including that the Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements, as the President ordered, and because none of the Plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service.\"\n\nThe government had asked that the January 1 requirement be put on hold while the appeal proceeds. The Pentagon's move on Monday signals the growing sense within the government that authorities are likely to lose the legal fight.",
    " Title: Snowden's Asylum in Russia and Ongoing Investigation into NSA Leaks\n\nArticle:\n\nEdward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, is currently living and working in Russia under a one-year asylum. The Russian government has refused to extradite Snowden, who was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in June on charges of espionage and theft of government property.\n\nSnowden has expressed a willingness to return to the United States if offered amnesty, but it remains unclear whether President Obama, who would likely have to make such a decision, would extend such an offer. The damage that Snowden's leaks have allegedly caused to national security is a point of contention.\n\nThe NSA is still uncertain about the extent of the data Snowden took. In some cases, government officials first learn about specific documents from reporters preparing their articles for publication, leaving the State Department with little time to notify foreign leaders about incoming disclosures.\n\nThe Justice Department continues its investigation into Snowden, with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents from the Washington field office leading the probe. According to senior government officials, Snowden methodically downloaded the files over several months while working as a government contractor at the Hawaii facility. The officials also believe that he worked alone.\n\nDespite Snowden's technical expertise, some American officials also place blame on the NSA for being slow to install software that can detect unusual computer activity carried out by the agency's workforce, which, at approximately 35,000 employees, is the largest of any intelligence agency.",
    " Title: Tahrir al-Sham's Technologically Advanced Recruitment Tactics Alarm Western Intelligence Agencies\n\nArticle:\n\nA recently deleted YouTube video showcases a young man, dressed in the attire of a modern jihadist, promoting the Levant Liberation Committee (Tahrir al-Sham), an umbrella group created through a merger between the Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front and other militant groups in Syria. The group, often referred to as ISIS 3.0, is known for its younger and less religious fighters, lack of interest in governance, and nimble operations.\n\nTahrir al-Sham's recruitment efforts have reportedly alarmed Western intelligence agencies due to the group's sophisticated use of technology. The group has employed a crowdfunding approach on the anonymous Telegram app to recruit new fighters, bypassing traditional recruitment video methods.\n\nThe group's potential capabilities pose significant threats to critical infrastructure. With a limited number of dedicated actors, Tahrir could potentially disrupt power grids, cellphone, GPS, and satellite communications, or hack into government computers and publish classified military and intelligence information, endangering Western agents and assets.\n\nTahrir's digital networks, operating on the principle of \"The narrower the audience, the bigger the impact,\" are difficult to detect and censor. Their use of encrypted communication channels and social networks on the Dark Web are not visible to satellites or vulnerable to bombing.\n\nThe still-emerging digital battlefield is a lesser-understood component of the 16-year war on terror. Tahrir militants have learned from ISIS's successes and failures on the battlefield, using multiple platforms to amplify their impact. While ISIS sent messages using a broadcast model, Tahrir has experimented with platforms like Sarahah, an app that allows users to send anonymous messages to one person, providing a honeypot approach for Tahrir to A/B test different messages.\n\nGovernments are still trying to censor ISIS on Twitter, while Tahrir is reportedly experimenting with an app that reaches over 16 million young people and is the top download in over 25 countries, including Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon. Tahrir can fail, quickly measure what resonates, and retool their pitch before the activity is detected by officials, leveraging their speed for an advantage.",
    " Title: Report Estimates 25 Million Americans Exempt from ObamaCare Penalty in 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nA new congressional report suggests that more than 25 million Americans without health insurance will not be subject to the penalty in 2016 due to an increasing number of ObamaCare exemptions. The Wall Street Journal, citing an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, reported that the number of people expected to pay the fine in 2016 has decreased from the previous projection of six million to four million.\n\nThe report is likely to raise fresh concerns among insurers, who have expressed concerns that the number of exemptions to the law's individual mandate are leading to fewer young, healthy people signing up for health insurance. An insurance pool skewed toward older, comparatively unhealthy people is likely to result in premiums rising.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the penalty for not purchasing health insurance is either $95 per adult or 1 percent of family income, whichever is greater. This amount is set to increase to $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of family income in 2016, with a total family penalty capped at $2,085.\n\nThe Act provides exemptions to the penalty for certain groups, such as illegal immigrants and members of certain Native American tribes or religious sects. The Obama administration has since added exemptions for hardships like domestic violence, property damage suffered in a fire or flood, or having a health plan canceled when ObamaCare came into effect this past October 1. One exemption, written as being for people who \"experienced another hardship acquiring health insurance,\" does not require documentation.\n\nResidents of 21 states who have opted not to expand their Medicaid program under the health law may also be exempt from the penalty. The Journal reports that more than 4 million Americans who receive subsidies through the federal ObamaCare exchange could qualify for hardship waivers if the subsidies are struck down in court.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was narrowly upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2012 in a ruling based in part on acceptance of the administration's argument that the law's individual mandate was not a tax. Republicans have argued that the Obama administration has undermined its own argument by issuing so many exemptions and should scrap the mandate completely.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the Journal that approximately 77,000 individuals and families have requested an exemption as of this past April. However, that number is expected to rise because many exemption requests can only be claimed on tax returns filed in 2015. The Obama administration has given people whose insurance plans were canceled because they did not meet ObamaCare's minimum coverage requirements an exemption that runs until October 2016. They are also allowed to buy a minimum amount of coverage originally available to people under 30.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Takes on Same-Sex Marriage Cases, Potentially Resolving Constitutional Right to Marry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has taken on two same-sex marriage cases, a move that could lead to a final resolution on the constitutional right to marry for same-sex couples in the remaining states that prohibit it. The court's decision to hear both cases, one from California and another seeking to establish a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, has some gay rights advocates bracing for a split decision.\n\nThe court's move comes eight years after Massachusetts became the first state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry, and four years after California voters rejected a ruling of their Supreme Court allowing same-sex marriages. The speed at which the court is moving has some advocates anticipating a resolution within months.\n\nThe court could strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman for federal purposes, or it could reject the idea that the Constitution requires states to allow same-sex marriage. This dual approach could lead to a split decision, with the court allowing same-sex marriages in some states but not others.\n\nSupporters of traditional marriage have expressed optimism, with Brian S. Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, stating, \"Taking both cases at the same time exposes the hypocrisy on the other side.\"\n\nThe court could also limit the trial court decision requiring California to allow same-sex marriage to just two counties or even to the couples who brought the case. The justices could also affirm a California-only rationale, which would mean Proposition 8, the voter initiative that banned same-sex marriage in the state, would fall, but its impact would be limited.\n\nThe court could also pursue what Kenji Yoshino, a law professor at New York University, calls the \"eight-state solution,\" affecting California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island. These states give gay and lesbian couples all the benefits and burdens of marriage but withhold the name \"marriage.\" A ruling in favor of this solution could violate equal protection principles, but it could also have \"perverse effects,\" according to Professor Yoshino.\n\nThe eight-state solution could discourage states from enacting laws allowing gay and lesbian couples to join in civil unions, fearing they would be forced to adopt same-sex marriage if they do. However, it is unlikely to provoke the same level of reaction as imposing same-sex marriage on states that currently prohibit it.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to consider the California case marks a change from the caution of an earlier era, when the court avoided cases that would require a decision on the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws. The court did not strike down laws banning interracial marriage until 1967, in Loving v. Virginia, when 16 states still had them on the books. It has been just four years since the California Supreme Court struck down two state laws limiting marriage to a man and a woman.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a major social change,\" wrote Justice Carol A. Corrigan in dissent. \"For some the process is frustratingly slow. For others it is jarringly fast.\"",
    " Title: Iranian Police Deny Using Live Ammunition Against Protesters Following Downing of Ukrainian Plane\n\nArticle:\n\nPolice in Tehran, the Iranian capital, have denied using live ammunition against protesters who took to the streets in outrage over the shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner. Officers were reportedly given orders to \"show restraint,\" according to the chief of police. Videos posted online on Sunday appeared to record gunfire and showed an injured woman being carried away. Protests erupted on Saturday, after Iran admitted to mistakenly firing missiles at the Ukraine International Airlines jet that crashed near Tehran, killing all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Canadians.\n\nFor the first three days after the crash, Iran denied that its armed forces had shot down the plane and suggested there had been a technical failure. The admission of responsibility, which came after video emerged of a missile appearing to hit the plane, provoked widespread anger in Iran against the establishment.\n\nDays earlier, Iranians had been united in grief over the killing of Gen Qasem Soleimani, their country's second most powerful man, in a US drone strike in Iraq. The latest reports of a possible crackdown echo the protests in Iran in November over rising fuel prices, during which human rights groups say hundreds of people were killed.\n\nSunday's demonstrations went on late into the night, as people vented their fury against the Iranian government and the powerful Revolutionary Guards, who shot down the Ukrainian plane. A video posted to social media shows a protester kicking and then ripping down a large poster of Soleimani. There were reports that a number of people were injured when security forces broke up a protest in Tehran's Azadi Square, during which people chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nOne video posted on social media allegedly showed members of the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force, which is often used to suppress domestic dissent, attacking protesters in the area. What appears to be gunfire can be heard. Another video shows an injured woman being carried away by people who shout that she has been shot in the leg. A pool of blood is seen on the ground.\n\nA protester who saw the injured woman told the BBC: \"They started to come with sticks, they started to beat us. When we started to shout slogans, they started to bombard us with fire, they started to shoot.\" Despite such reports, Tehran police chief Brig-Gen Hossein Rahimi insisted that his officers did not fire live ammunition at protesters.\n\n\"The police treated the people who had gathered with patience and tolerance,\" he said, before warning that \"those who intend to manipulate the situation\" would face consequences. Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei meanwhile dismissed as \"crocodile tears\" US President Donald Trump's expressions of support for the protesters.\n\nFresh protests reportedly took place on Monday afternoon outside universities in Tehran and the city of Isfahan. Footage showed students at the capital's Sharif University of Technology chanting \"They killed our elites and replaced them with clerics\" - a reference to Iranian students who were on flight PS752.\n\nThe captain of the national men's volleyball team, Said Marouf, wrote on Instagram that he hoped Iran had seen its \"last show\" of \"deceit and stupidity.\" And one of Iran's most famous actresses, Taraneh Alidoosti, posted that Iranians were being treated not as citizens but as \"hostages.\"\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister, Vadym Prystaiko, told the BBC that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had assured the Ukrainian government in a telephone call that \"no-one who is to [blame] will escape punishment.\" Mr Prystaiko added that five of the countries that had citizens on board the airliner - Canada, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden, and an unnamed country - would meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action.\n\nHe said the \"grieving nations\" would work out what steps to take individually and collectively to \"bring the perpetrators to justice and how we can repay those families who have suffered.\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also told a memorial service for the 57 Canadian victims that their country would \"not rest until we get the accountability, justice, and closure that the families deserve.\"\n\nLater, the head of Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB), Kathy Fox, said Iran still had the black boxes from the aircraft, and that they were damaged. But Ms Fox said there were early signs that Iran was \"allowing the TSB to play a more active role than normally permitted\" - such as by inviting its investigators to take part in downloading and analyzing data.\n\nThe Iranian government meanwhile denied there had been a cover-up. \"On these sad days, numerous criticisms were raised against the country's officials; some of us have been accused of lying and secrecy,\" spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters on Monday. \"But honestly, it was not like that.\"\n\n\"The reality is that we did not lie,\" he added, blaming \"a lack of valid information\" and also \"the US's psychological warfare\" for his own and other officials' denials that the plane was shot down. Mr Rabiei insisted that senior officials, including President Rouhani, did not know that missiles had been launched at the airliner until Friday evening. However, the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Force Commander, Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, had said when admitting its role in the \"unintentional\" strike that he had informed officials about it on Wednesday.\n\nGen Hajizadeh said on Saturday that Iran's air defenses had been on the highest state of alert because the Revolutionary Guards had just fired ballistic missiles at US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani. The operator of a missile defense system near Tehran's airport mistook flight PS752 for a US missile and due to problems with a communication system was unable to contact the command center, according to the general. \"He had 10 seconds to decide,\" he added. \"He could have decided to strike or not to strike, and under such circumstances he took the wrong decision.\"\n\nIn a separate development on Monday, the UK Foreign Office summoned Iran's ambassador in London following the detention of his British counterpart in Tehran after he attended a vigil for victims of the Ukrainian plane crash. The CEO of Canadian company Maple Leaf Foods, Michael McCain, meanwhile criticized the US government for escalating tensions in the Middle East in the days before the crash, in which he said a colleague lost his family.",
    " Title: NSA's Middle East and North Africa Group Updates Sigint Collection Capabilities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2008, the National Security Agency (NSA) made changes to its Signals Intelligence (Sigint) collection capabilities within its Middle East and North Africa group. The changes resulted in a significant reduction in the number of search terms, or selectors, and the daily messages added to the agency's Pinwale database.\n\nThe reduction in volume was considered a major achievement, allowing for new collection on Iranian leadership and Saudi and Syrian diplomats, according to a report. The NSA's Middle East analysts discovered major glitches in their search software, with one target missing over 500 messages in a week due to the software's inability to search for email addresses.\n\nJoel F. Brenner, the agency's former inspector general, believes much of the criticism directed at the NSA is unfair, reflecting a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the realpolitik of spying. However, he also stated that technology has outpaced policy at the NSA, and that routine targeting of close allies may be bad politics and is foolish in an era where spying may be exposed.\n\nWilliam E. Binney, a former senior NSA official who has become an outspoken critic, is less concerned about foreign leaders' sensitivities and more about the potential danger the NSA poses at home. He believes without new leadership, new laws, and top-to-bottom reform, the agency will represent a threat of \"turnkey totalitarianism\" - the capability to turn its immense power, now directed mainly against other countries, on the American public.\n\nBobby R. Inman, who served as NSA director from 1977 to 1981, offers a radical suggestion for the agency: to release everything they believe Edward Snowden has and make it public. Inman suggests this would be a shock to the agency but could help them move past the controversy and begin rebuilding.",
    " Title: Trump's Campaign and Policy Shifts Raise Concerns Among Experts\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been known for his shifting policy positions and controversial statements, particularly regarding immigration, international affairs, and economic policies.\n\nTrump's campaign strategy has been marked by the use of divisive and controversial rhetoric, such as the \"birther\" campaign against former President Barack Obama's legitimacy and repeated denunciations of trade deals and relations with China. NBC News has reported that Trump has made 117 distinct policy shifts on 20 major issues, including three contradictory views on abortion in one eight-hour stretch.\n\nTrump's tax-cut plan has been a source of concern, with initial estimates suggesting it could cost $10 trillion in tax revenue, later revised to $3 trillion by one adviser. However, there is no credible indication of how this would be paid for, with assurances that those in the upper brackets will be favored.\n\nTrump's plan for cutting the national debt has also raised eyebrows, with his suggestion that he might try to persuade creditors to accept less than the government owed. This idea, imported from Trump's debt-steeped real estate world, would undermine faith in the government and the stability of global financial markets.\n\nTrump's open doubts about the value of NATO and his repeated denunciations of trade deals present a major diplomatic and security challenge. His plan to renegotiate the Iran nuclear control agreement and his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin have also raised concerns among experts.\n\nTrump's admiration for Putin and his urging Russia to meddle in the presidential campaign by hacking Hillary Clinton's emails have been particularly contentious issues. Experts warn that if Trump were to become president, Putin might obtain favorable deals if Trump, his admirer, wins the White House.\n\nVoters should consider the potential consequences of Trump's policies, such as the potential for trade wars leading to recession, the impact of a large deficit on the economy, and the potential loss of the new national health insurance system that millions now depend on. Trump has yet to provide a clear plan for replacing the health insurance system.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's campaign and policy shifts have raised concerns among experts, with many warning of the potential negative consequences of his proposed policies on the economy, diplomatic relations, and national security. Voters should carefully consider the kind of change they want and whether Trump's policies align with their values and goals.",
    " Title: Biden and Bloomberg Push for Tougher Gun Control Legislation, Citing Reduction in Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe push for stricter federal gun control laws has encountered a political impasse, but this has not deterred Vice President Joe Biden and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. On Thursday, they advocated for the \"importance of passing common sense legislation to reduce gun violence,\" including the implementation of a comprehensive background check system for all gun sales.\n\nThe duo spoke at New York City Hall, with prospects for a ban on semi-automatic weapons resembling military assault weapons seemingly stalled. Bloomberg cited public opinion polls showing widespread support for background checks, stating, \"there's no real debate among Americans about this issue.\" He argued that nationwide background checks on all gun sales would save lives, and that the only question \"is if Congress has the courage to do the right thing.\"\n\nBloomberg emphasized that guns purchased in states with \"weak gun laws\" often end up in states with stricter requirements. Biden, who praised Bloomberg's \"immense\" and \"committed\" gun control work, criticized those who argue that the proposals would infringe upon rights.\n\n\"Tell me how it violates anyone's constitutional rights to limit (ammunition clips) to 10 rounds,\" Biden said. \"Think about Newtown... Think about how many children and teachers may be alive today had (the shooter) had to reload (more often than) he did.\"\n\nBiden expressed optimism that Congress will take action this spring, stating, \"There is no question that if this becomes law, it will keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. It will reduce violent crime. It will save lives. We know that's true, because in states that already require background checks on private sales, the rate of women murdered by an intimate partner armed with a gun is 38% lower than in states that do not have such background checks.\"\n\nThe ban proposal, vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association, is expected to receive fewer than 40 votes, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday, falling short of the threshold needed to defeat a filibuster or pass the Senate. Instead, the ban could be offered as an amendment to the gun legislation on the Senate floor to secure a vote on it, Reid said.\n\nBiden, who lauded Bloomberg's \"immense\" and \"committed\" gun control work, criticized those who say the proposals would violate rights. \"Tell me how it violates anyone's constitutional rights to limit (ammunition clips) to 10 rounds,\" Biden said. \"Think about Newtown... Think about how many children and teachers may be alive today had (the shooter) had to reload (more often than) he did.\"\n\nHe worked to raise the spirits of people discouraged by the power of the gun lobby. \"I was told in 1992, when I introduced many of these reforms, that there was no way, you never beat the gun lobby, it's not possible. Well, in 1994, we did. In 1994, reason prevailed, and we passed the assault weapons ban, a limitation on the size of magazines, and a number of other measures, including expanding the so-called Brady Bill and background checks.\"\n\nMany reforms have since expired. But, he said, \"One thing I want to lay to rest at the outset: They worked. They all had a positive impact on public safety.\"\n\nBiden said that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown was carried out with \"a weapon of war, and that weapon of war has no place on American streets.\" The shooter, Adam Lanza, used a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to kill 20 children and six adult staff members.\n\n\"Taking it off American streets has no impact on one's constitutional right to own a weapon,\" Biden said. He also noted that conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \"acknowledged that government has a right to limit certain weapons from being able to be possessed by American citizens.\"\n\nBiden expressed his admiration for the Newtown families and said their presence has helped move legislation through the Senate Judiciary Committee and gives such gun control reform a \"fighting chance.\"\n\n\"It takes an enormous amount of courage to be here,\" Biden said to the families. \"And you say, well, what's the courage? Having lost a child, I understand that every time you show up at something that ranges from a memorial service, or to talk about the circumstances in which your child was lost, it comes back to you in a flash, as if they got that phone call yesterday. And I told you before, I do not know how you do it, but you do it. You do it.\"\n\n(Biden's first wife and the couple's 1-year-old daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972.)\n\nBiden argued against those who say assault weapons and high-capacity magazines cannot be banned. He said gun-trafficking legislation will give police \"the power 'to be able to deal more rationally with straw sales, those sales where people go in, buy multiple guns, and then sell them to the bad guys.\" He said the more police are on the streets, the better.\n\nThe proposed reforms, Biden said, \"will not solve every problem. It will not end every gun death. But it will substantially reduce it. And it matters.\"",
    " Title: The Broken Process of Supreme Court Justice Appointments: A Look at the Current State of SCOTUS Nominations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, following the contentious political climate that ensued after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, has highlighted the broken process for selecting Supreme Court justices in the United States. In 2016, Senate Republicans, in response to Scalia's death, established the principle that open seats on the Supreme Court should not be filled during an election year. This principle, if applied consistently, would mean that Supreme Court seats would be unfilled 50 percent of the time, given America's biannual national elections.\n\nThe ensuing political tension led to Democrats filibustering Neil Gorsuch, a broadly qualified nominee who would have likely passed easily in previous eras. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. This tit-for-tat escalation, as political scientist Steven Smith terms it, is known as \"Senate syndrome.\"\n\nCurrently, the minority party holds no power over Supreme Court picks. The majority party can and will appoint their preferred candidate, who will serve for life. However, when the Senate and the White House are controlled by different parties, there is almost no chance that any seat on the Court will be filled.\n\nFor instance, if Democrats win the Senate in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg retires in 2019, the chances of Trump replacing Ginsburg and giving conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court are slim. This situation, where the stakes are too high and the process is unpredictable, has led to Supreme Court nominations becoming a contest of power, with real consequences for American life.\n\nThe Supreme Court decides how elections are funded, whether abortions are legal, and whether millions of people will continue to have health insurance. Given the life-altering impact of these decisions, it is no surprise that elected politicians and activist groups view the composition of the Court as a matter of life and death.\n\nWhile Merrick Garland was relatively moderate, his appointment would have shifted the Court to a 5-4 liberal majority, leading to a series of transformative rulings that Republicans might find abhorrent. Neil Gorsuch, though qualified, has ruled in ways that Democrats find awful, and the clarity of his opinions will not soften their effects.\n\nThe core problem lies in the high stakes of Supreme Court nominations. Candidates serve for life, and the timing of open seats is unpredictable. President Jimmy Carter served four years and saw no open seats, while President George H.W. Bush served four years and filled two. Barack Obama served eight years and named two justices, and Donald Trump has already been given two vacancies in less than two years.\n\nTo deescalate Supreme Court fights, a possible solution is to limit terms. Holding justices to a 10-year, nonrenewable term would lower the stakes of any individual Supreme Court nomination and make the timing of fights more predictable. This reform could have bipartisan support, as it would ensure that every President would have the opportunity to replace two Justices per term, and that no court could stretch its ideology over multiple generations.\n\nImplementing a reform like this would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that is now dangerously broken, infuriatingly random, and distorting both our politics and the judges we choose to interpret our laws.",
    " Title: Cory Booker Drops Out of Presidential Race After Failing to Qualify for December Primary Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrat Cory Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, has ended his presidential campaign following his failure to qualify for the December primary debate. His departure leaves a field that was once the most diverse in history with only one remaining African American candidate, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick.\n\nSince launching his campaign in February 2019, Booker struggled to raise the necessary funds for a White House bid. He was at the back of the pack in most surveys and failed to meet the polling requirements needed to participate in Tuesday's debate. Booker also missed last month's debate and exits the race polling in low single digits in the early primary states and nationwide.\n\nIn an email to supporters, Booker stated that his failure to make the debates prevented him from raising the money required for victory. He also mentioned that the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump would deal a significant blow to his campaign by pulling him away from Iowa in the final weeks before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.\n\nBooker had hinted at the challenges facing his campaign last week in an interview on The \u2588\u2588\u2588' \"Ground Game\" podcast. He stated that if they couldn't raise more money in the final stretch, they wouldn't be able to do the things that other campaigns with more money could do to show presence.\n\nIn his email to supporters, Booker pledged to do \"everything in my power to elect the eventual Democratic nominee for president,\" though his campaign states he has no immediate plans to endorse a candidate in the primary.\n\nCory Booker was once lauded for his role in the renewal of Newark, New Jersey, as the \"rock star mayor\" who helped lead the city's revitalization. During his seven years in City Hall, Booker was known for his headline-grabbing feats of local do-goodery, including running into a burning building to save a woman, and his early fluency with social media, which brought him 1.4 million followers on Twitter when the platform was little used in politics.\n\nBooker's rhetorical skills and Ivy League background often brought comparisons to President Barack Obama, and he had been discussed as a potential presidential contender since his arrival in the Senate in 2013. Now, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has mastered the art of the selfie on social media. Another former mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is seen as the freshest face in the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden has built a strong base of support with black voters.\n\nBooker's message of hope and love seemed to fall flat during an era characterized perhaps most strongly by Democratic fury over the actions of the Trump administration. An early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in Iowa and South Carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run, as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary, when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads.\n\nOn the stump, Booker emphasized his Midwestern connections and delivered an exhortation to voters to use \"radical love\" to overcome what he considered Trump's hate. However, he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail, even when asked directly. Even some of Booker's supporters worried his message on Trump wasn't sharp enough to go up against a Republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud.\n\nBooker struggled to land on a message that would resonate with voters. He's long been seen as a progressive Democrat in the Senate, pushing for criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. And on the campaign trail, he proposed establishing a $1,000 savings account for every child born in the U.S. to help close the racial wealth gap.\n\nHe was among the first candidates to release a gun control plan, and at the time it was the most ambitious in the field, as it included a gun licensing program that would have been seen as political suicide just a decade before. He also released an early criminal justice reform plan that focused heavily on addressing sentencing disparities for drug crimes.\n\nHowever, he also sought to frame himself as an uplifting, unifying figure who emphasized his bipartisan work record. That didn't land in a Democratic primary that has often rewarded candidates who promised voters they were tough-minded fighters who could take on Trump.\n\nBooker's seat is up for a vote this year, and he will run for reelection to the Senate. A handful of candidates has launched campaigns for the seat, but Booker is expected to have an easy path to reelection. Booker's exit from the presidential race further narrows the once two dozen-strong field, which now stands at 12 candidates.",
    " Title: Rolling Thunder Ride for Freedom Faces Potential Decline as Vietnam Veterans Age\n\nArticle:\n\nThe annual Rolling Thunder Ride for Freedom, America's largest single-day motorcycle rally, took place in Washington on Sunday, with concerns about a potential decline in participation as Vietnam veterans, who form the event's core, age. Artie Muller, executive director of Rolling Thunder Inc., the nonprofit foundation that sponsors the freedom ride, expressed concerns about the future of the organization.\n\nThe Ride for Freedom, which began in 1988 with approximately 2,500 motorcycles and riders, has grown steadily over the years, with 1 million riders and spectators attending the rally on Sunday. However, the growth is primarily due to supporters and family members of younger veterans, as veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have gravitated toward other organizations.\n\nOne such organization is Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). IAVA riders, on Victory motorcycles, rode alongside Rolling Thunder for the Memorial Day weekend event. IAVA has started its own parades, with Victory providing bikes to escort the veterans.\n\nHarley-Davidson has a significant market share in the U.S., with approximately 52% of the market, and Rolling Thunder bikers predominantly ride Harley-Davidson motorcycles. However, younger riders and those who ride for IAVA have increasingly been choosing Victory motorcycles. Victory motorcycles were introduced in 1998 and were designed to compete directly with Harley-Davidson.\n\nVictory has pursued a partnership with IAVA. On Veterans Day last year, Victory announced it would donate $500 for each bike sold in November and December to IAVA. This year, IAVA riders rode alongside Rolling Thunder for the Memorial Day weekend event.\n\nIAVA's deputy director of strategic corporate and foundation partnerships, Matt Colvin, sees the group as the next generation of riders. He expressed hope that the younger veterans would eventually integrate with Rolling Thunder. Rolling Thunder's executive director, Artie Muller, echoed this sentiment and expressed hope that more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans would participate in the event.\n\nDespite the potential decline in numbers, the sentiment behind the Ride for Freedom remains strong. IAVA and Rolling Thunder will continue to work together, but it is not yet time for the younger veterans to take over, according to Mr. Colvin. He believes that there is a next generation that will step up and take over in the future.",
    " Title: New Electronic Voting Machines Deployed in U.S. Elections Amid Concerns Over Foreign Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week's national elections marked the first use of new electronic voting machines in two states, as well as a shift in governorships and legislative control in Virginia to the Democrats. The elections also served as a test for the new voting systems, which were implemented to protect the 2020 election from foreign interference.\n\nThe deployment of these new machines follows the 2000 Bush v. Gore election, which was marred by disputes over hanging chads and confusing butterfly ballots. In response, Congress approved over $3 billion to replace older voting methods with easy-to-use electronic voting machines. However, cybersecurity was an afterthought at the time, leading to the current systems that rely on voting machines vulnerable to hacking.\n\nRussia targeted election systems in all 50 states during its effort to influence the 2016 election, and is expected to launch a similar campaign in 2020. Intelligence officials also fear that foreign powers like China and Iran may engage in similar activities.\n\nTo address these concerns, more than 130,000 new machines have been purchased to replace older paperless ones, many of which carry known security vulnerabilities. These old machines do not create a paper backup, making it impossible to verify whether their results have been compromised. Despite the push from Congress to replace them, it is estimated that 16 million voters will use paperless machines in 2020.\n\nSome security experts worry that the new machines, which provide a paper backup that can be checked by voters and election officials, are also insecure. Most are not connected to the internet, but they can be compromised within minutes by a savvy hacker in person. These new machines were used for the first time last week in a number of districts across the country, with some locations reporting major glitches.\n\nThe issues with the new machines have led some election security experts to call for a return to old-fashioned pen and paper ballots. However, some experts worry that a return to paper voting could bring back old issues such as voter error, confusing ballots, slow counts, and suppressed turnout.\n\nThere is bipartisan consensus in Congress that more needs to be done to secure the country's voting machines. A bill providing extra funding for election systems recently passed both houses, and more money could be apportioned before 2020. However, legislation passed by House Democrats that would require all voting systems to have a paper record has stalled in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nThe next big debate in election integrity may involve the use of smartphones for voting, a method that was used for the first time by a small number of voters last Tuesday. While this method is seen as potentially increasing access to voting, it raises troubling security concerns.\n\nJohn Brandon, writing for Fox News, stated, \"The main issue is that criminals and foreign operatives intent on disrupting the midterms have worked harder, faster, and with more intent than those trying to fend off the attacks. Hackers rely on automated processes \u2014 apps, development tools, and online databases on services like GitHub or Pastebin \u2014 that make it easy to hack the machines used for tallying votes.\"\n\nIn contrast, Jim Geraghty, writing for National Review, argued, \"No hacker in Moscow can reach across the World Wide Web and alter what your ballot says. Even if they somehow managed to alter the data being tabulated in some local or state government system that is connected to the Internet, a recount would reveal the discrepancy.\"\n\nThe potential erosion of public confidence in the election process due to perceived insecurity is a concern. As Lee C. Bollinger and Michael A. McRobbie wrote in The Hill, \"It is sobering to consider the effect that a deep erosion of public confidence in the election process could have. It would be devastating to Americans' faith in our democracy and the legitimacy of our elected government.\"",
    " Title: Caroline Kennedy Nominated as U.S. Ambassador to Japan\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy and a prominent Democratic supporter, has been nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Kennedy would become the first woman to hold the post.\n\nKennedy, a top supporter of Obama, served as the co-chair of his vice presidential search committee in 2008. She has largely shunned the limelight and scrutiny associated with her famous last name, but has made speeches at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions.\n\nAfter publicly expressing interest in running for the U.S. Senate seat in New York vacated when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, Kennedy ultimately decided against making a bid, citing \"personal reasons.\"\n\nKennedy has a background in education, having received degrees at Harvard and Columbia. She has served in a variety of roles at New York non-profits, including the John F. Kennedy Library and the American Ballet Theatre.\n\nThe current U.S. ambassador to Japan is John Roos, who assumed the role in 2009. He was the first American ambassador to attend commemoration ceremonies for the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He also led America's embassy through the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the ensuing nuclear aftermath.\n\nThe United States is Japan's largest economic partner and a military ally. The U.S. military presence on Japan's Okinawa Island has remained a point of diplomatic tension between the two nations. Some of the island's residents have complained about noise from the base, located in an urban area. Many others were incensed by the misconduct of U.S. troops stationed there, including the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. military personnel.\n\nOpposition to the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa runs so deep that it contributed to the resignation of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in 2010. He had promised to move the base but later announced that the base would stay, a decision he called \"heartbreaking.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Discusses Coronavirus, Travel Restrictions, and Irish Prime Minister's Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump reassured reporters on Thursday that the markets would recover as he welcomed Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to the White House for a meeting to celebrate the ties between the U.S. and Ireland. However, stocks plunged 7% after the opening bell that morning due to fears and fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nThe visit comes after President Trump's Wednesday night announcement of travel restrictions on Europe due to the global spread of the deadly coronavirus. The new travel restrictions do not apply to Ireland or the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring a press conference in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump addressed criticism that he decided to restrict travel from Europe without consulting European leaders. Mr. Trump explained that it takes a long time to make individual calls to world leaders, and claimed Europe does not alert the U.S. when it raises taxes on the U.S. Mr. Trump insisted his announcement was \"clear,\" even though his own White House had to clarify the announcement.\n\n\"Well, we get along very well with the European leaders, but we had to make a decision, and I didn't want to take time and -- you know, it takes a long time to make the individual calls,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"And we are calling, and we have spoken to some of them prior to -- some of the majors, prior to. But we had to move quickly.\"\n\nPresident Trump stated that his team has not discussed travel restrictions within the United States, but he did not rule it out, as the National Guard moves into a New York suburb to establish the country's first containment zone. The president insisted that he has more authority than most people know, and hinted that he's been reading up on the Stafford Act, the federal law outlining the means of deploying federal natural disaster assistance to state and local governments.\n\n\"We need a little separation until such time as this goes away. It's going to go away, it's going to go away,\" Mr. Trump said, seemingly referring to former Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb. \"But in the meantime, we want to lose as few people as possible, so important.\"\n\nThe president's meeting with the Irish prime minister is one of the few events that is proceeding as the U.S. grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. As of Thursday, there were more than 1,300 confirmed cases of the illness in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are 43 confirmed cases in Ireland.\n\nVaradkar is set to attend the annual \"Friends of Ireland\" luncheon hosted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill on Thursday. President Trump attended the luncheon in the first three years of his presidency but is skipping this year's event, citing the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last year. President Trump told reporters on Thursday that he is too busy.\n\n\"Since the speaker has chosen to tear this nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the president will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity,\" White House spokesman Judd Deere said earlier this week.\n\nOfficials in Washington, D.C., and around the nation have begun to cancel large events due to the coronavirus, which has spread to more than 100 countries. At the White House, public tours have been halted, and in the U.S. Capitol, congressional leaders are nearing a pause on tours.\n\nPresident Trump also canceled upcoming events in Nevada, Colorado, and Wisconsin \"out of an abundance of caution from the coronavirus outbreak,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said late Wednesday.\n\nThe White House and Congress are weighing a legislative package to provide economic relief to businesses and people impacted by the virus. President Trump said he wants paid sick leave to be a part of that.",
    " Title: Obama's Fourth Defense Chief Selection: Ash Carter's Appointment and the White House's Influence on Defense Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's selection of Ash Carter as his fourth defense secretary marks a critical moment in the president's relationship with the military and national security, as the choice signals a continuation of the White House's active role in setting defense policy.\n\nCarter, a well-regarded policy expert and former deputy defense secretary, is expected to carry out the strategy set by the West Wing and the National Security Council, rather than shift the balance of power back to the Pentagon. This is in line with the Obama administration's approach to defense policy, which has been marked by a greater White House role in setting defense policy compared to previous administrations.\n\nTwo of Obama's previous defense chiefs, Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, have criticized the White House for policy failures and interference. The third, Chuck Hagel, was reportedly unable to navigate the White House currents and was let go without an obvious replacement.\n\nThe White House's control over defense policy has been a source of criticism, with some arguing that it undermines the traditional role of the Pentagon and the military. Former State Department official Aaron David Miller described Obama as \"one of the most controlling foreign policy presidents, if not the most controlling, since Richard Nixon.\"\n\nThe White House's sensitivity to criticism of undue interference was evident this week, with White House press secretary Josh Earnest reminding reporters that previous administrations had also experienced White House-Pentagon divisions.\n\nThe choice of Carter, who lacks a strong political profile but is widely touted for his policy expertise, has been met with mixed reactions. Kori Schake, an NSC defense official and State Department official under George W. Bush, described the choice as \"better management of the department than Chuck Hagel offered but no change in the sweeping arrogance of the president's closest policy advisers on national security.\"\n\nMany former officials are waiting to see how Carter adjusts to his new position and whether he develops the political skills to handle the White House better than his predecessors. Lawrence Korb, a Reagan administration assistant defense secretary, noted that Carter lacks the leverage over the White House that Gates and even Panetta had.\n\nNonetheless, Carter is expected to face challenges in building a strong team at the Pentagon and navigating the White House's influence on defense policy. The success of his tenure will depend on his ability to balance the demands of the White House with the needs of the military and the Pentagon.",
    " Title: High Approval Rate of President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program Affects Supreme Court Case\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which offers temporary protection from deportation and work permits to certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, has approved 93 percent of all applications decided through December 2016. This high approval rate is likely to influence the Supreme Court's decision next month on a legal challenge to a broader amnesty program.\n\nThe DACA program, announced in late 2014, is considered a test run for a broader amnesty program that Obama proposed, which has been halted by lower courts as they determine the administration's authority to grant temporary stays of deportation, issue work permits, and make illegal immigrants eligible for some taxpayer benefits.\n\nCritics argue that the high approval rate undercuts the administration's claim that it is not rewriting the law but offering guidance on how to prioritize enforcement. They contend that the 93 percent approval rate suggests that the program does not have stringent eligibility criteria.\n\nSupporters of the program argue that the high approval rate is due to the immigrants' diligence in ensuring their eligibility before applying, resulting in fewer borderline cases and fewer denials. They also point out that the nearly $500 application fee makes immigrants think carefully before applying.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on April 18 and could issue a ruling by the end of June. The case, led by Texas and 25 other states, challenges the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would extend amnesty to the parents of DACA recipients.\n\nThe DACA approval rate has become an issue in the DAPA case, as lower court judges have used the performance of the Dreamer amnesty to inform their rulings on the broader program for parents. At the end of last year, nearly 715,000 people had been approved, and fewer than 55,000 had been rejected.\n\nImmigrant rights groups have countered the argument that the administration lacks discretion in granting or denying DACA applications by citing cases where officers have used discretion to reject applications. For example, they point to the case of an immigrant named Christian, who was denied despite meeting all the criteria and being a hardship case, and the case of Francisco, a Virginia man who was denied despite being married to a U.S. citizen and having a U.S.-citizen child.\n\nThe Supreme Court will now decide whether the administration has the authority to grant temporary stays of deportation, issue work permits, and make illegal immigrants eligible for some taxpayer benefits. The decision could have significant implications for the millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. who are eligible for the DACA and DAPA programs.",

The order, issued on Thursday, upholds an initial ruling in January that found the Kleins had violated Oregon civil-rights law by refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex ceremony in 2013.\n\nOregon labor commissioner Brad Avakian, in his 122-page order, stated, \"This case is not about a wedding cake or a marriage. It is about a business's refusal to serve someone because of their sexual orientation.\" He added, \"Under Oregon law, that is illegal.\"\n\nThe Kleins had argued that participating in the wedding by baking the cake would have violated their religious beliefs, but Mr. Avakian rejected the distinction between discriminating against a same-sex couple and refusing to participate in a same-sex ceremony. \"The forum has already found there to be no distinction between the two,\" he said.\n\nThe Kleins' attorney, Anna Harmon, called the final order a \"shocking result which shows the state's relentless campaign to punish Oregonians who live and work according to their faith,\" according to KATU-TV in Portland. The Kleins, who closed their shop and now sell baked goods from their home, indicated in a Facebook post that they \"will NOT give up this fight,\" suggesting they may appeal the order to the Oregon Court of Appeals.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Kleins stated, \"According to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech. We stand for God's truth, God's word and freedom for ALL Americans. We are here to obey God not man, and we will not conform to this world.\"\n\nThe Sweet Cakes case is one of at least a half-dozen involving complaints by same-sex couples against Christian small business owners who declined to provide products for gay weddings. The specifics of these other cases were not provided in the source text.",
    " Title: Sanders' Resolute Attitude Towards Democratic Party and Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate, has displayed a newfound determination in his campaign, a development that stems from months of frustration with the national Democratic Party. This frustration is attributed to a perceived bias in the debate schedule, fund-raising arrangements, and the appointment of Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) also rebuked Sanders on Tuesday for not explicitly condemning a violent incident at the Nevada Democratic convention over the weekend.\n\nDespite Sanders' expressed desire for Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, not to win in November, his advisers and allies suggest that he is prepared to cause some damage to Hillary Clinton in the short term if it means securing a majority of the 475 pledged delegates in California and arriving at the Philadelphia convention with significant political influence.\n\nTad Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders, stated that the campaign does not believe their attacks will benefit Trump in the long run, but added that the senator's team is \"not thinking about\" the possibility of their actions potentially derailing Clinton from becoming the first woman elected president.\n\nDevine emphasized, \"The only thing that matters is what happens between now and June 14,\" referring to the final Democratic primary in the District of Columbia. \"We have to put the blinders on and focus on the best case to make in the upcoming states. If we do that, we can be in a strong position to make the best closing argument before the convention. If not, everyone will know in mid-June, and we'll have to take a hard look at where things stand.\"\n\nThe prospect of a prolonged Democratic primary battle is causing concern among party leaders who are eager for Clinton and House and Senate candidates to focus on attacking Trump without being distracted by internal Democratic strife. Sanders has garnered nearly 10 million votes compared to Clinton's 13 million, and Democratic leaders argue that Clinton needs time to court young voters, liberals, and Sanders supporters who view her as aligned with corporate and big-money interests.",
    " Title: Millennial Political Alliances: A Shift in the 2016 Presidential Election Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential election is approaching, and an unusual silence pervades social media regarding potential candidates, particularly among the millennial generation. This demographic, known for their vocal opinions, appears to be in a state of political indecision as the political alliances of millennials are up for grabs.\n\nFor the past seven years, millennials have been steadfast in their support of marriage equality, aligning with the Democrat Party's platform. However, with the legalization of gay marriage in every state, many millennials find themselves apathetic towards the political landscape without a direct loyalty to the Democrat Party.\n\nMillennials' political views are diverse, as evidenced by the results of a recent Reason Foundation poll. They desire small government, provided budget cuts do not directly affect them. They have higher approval ratings for Congress than any other generation, yet they oppose Obamacare, despite supporting the promise of universal health care.\n\nThe millennial generation's political leanings are complex, and their desire for limited government is a common thread. This desire for minimal government intervention is surprising, given the past eight years' focus on taxing the wealthy and redistributing wealth. However, millennials are more inclined to support movements that raise money for those in need, without government control over how and where to do so.\n\nThe political affiliations of millennials are in flux, and the Republican Party, when stripped to its bare bones, may have what millennials want to rally behind. The millennial generation desires freedom to pursue their passions, start their own companies, and enjoy life without government intervention. They value their wealth and want to use it as they see fit.\n\nIf the Republican Party can learn how to create a conversation centered around limited government, 2016's political landscape may become more red than anticipated. The political affiliations of the millennial generation are officially up for grabs.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Performance in Democratic Race Draws Mixed Reviews from Commentators\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic primary race has seen Hillary Clinton securing victories in multiple states, yet she is receiving negative reviews from some political commentators. Despite President Obama's endorsement and Clinton's expected victory, some commentators express concerns about her performance and her ability to withstand a potential challenge from Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nJoe Klein, a longtime observer of the Clinton family, offers a critical assessment of Clinton's political style and her potential matchup against Trump. He suggests that Clinton, often perceived as the embodiment of the political establishment, may struggle to connect with voters in the current political climate.\n\nKlein argues that Clinton's speaking style, which he describes as \"nutritious but bland,\" may not resonate with voters, particularly in comparison to Trump's more direct and divisive approach. He also criticizes Clinton's perceived tendency to avoid taking firm positions on certain issues, which he sees as a liability in the current political climate.\n\nAnother concern raised by commentators is Clinton's low polling marks on honesty, a result of the email scandal and decades of accumulated accusations. Veteran journalist Jeff Greenfield identifies three reasons why Clinton could prove to be a weak candidate: mistrust among the electorate, her association with the political establishment, and her perceived embodiment of the past rather than the future.\n\nDespite these concerns, Clinton enjoys broad support within the Democratic Party, and most Bernie Sanders supporters are expected to shift their allegiance to her. However, the same cannot be said for Trump, who is facing a Republican revolt against his potential nomination.\n\nThe article concludes by noting that Clinton's ability to generate enthusiasm among voters, particularly younger voters, will be a key factor in her ability to win the general election. The success of her campaign will be measured by improved reviews from journalists on the left, indicating a more authentic and engaging political style.",

On Tuesday, White House officials accused Russia of attempting to conceal the Syrian government's alleged role in a chemical attack that killed 86 civilians, including dozens of children, last week. The U.S. asserts the Syrian government carried out the attack, while Russia has blamed the anti-government rebels.\n\nDuring the trip, Russian President Vladimir Putin has signaled he may meet with Tillerson. This is a departure from Putin's earlier position.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers and Jewish organizations, including the Anne Frank Center, are calling for White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's resignation following his controversial comments regarding the Syrian conflict. Spicer compared the Syrian regime to Hitler and falsely claimed Hitler never used chemical weapons.\n\nIn response to these allegations, Spicer stated, \"You look, we didn't use chemical weapons in World War II. You know, you had a\u2014you know, someone as despicable as Hitler, who didn't even sink to the\u2014to using chemical weapons.\"\n\nIn fact, the Nazis systematically used poison gas as part of their genocide of 6 million Jews and others. The Nazis began experimenting with gas with the specific purpose of carrying out mass murder in the late 1930s. After the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, they deployed gas vans to kill hundreds of thousands of people. By 1942, the Nazis had set up a series of concentration camps where gas chambers were the main method of killing people. At its peak, as many as 6,000 people, mostly Jews, were gassed to death every day at Auschwitz concentration camp alone.\n\nDuring his comments, Spicer also referred to Nazi concentration camps as \"holocaust centers.\"\n\nHours later, Spicer apologized, although he made a number of mistakes during his apology, including mispronouncing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's name. Spicer stated, \"I mistakenly used an inappropriate and insensitive reference to the Holocaust, for which, frankly, there is no\u2014there is no comparison. And for that, I apologize. It was a mistake to do that.\"\n\nIn his apology, Spicer also mispronounced Assad's name, with CNN's Wolf Blitzer correcting him, stating, \"Bashar al-Assad. I know you've mispronounced his name a few times, but it's Bashar al-Assad.\"\n\nSpicer later clarified that he meant to say President Trump was seeking to stabilize the region, not to destabilize it.",

The act is anticipated to face administrative challenges, and consumers may experience a significant adjustment. Some Republicans are reportedly counting on the law's difficulties to provide them with a substantial electoral advantage.\n\nHowever, new evidence, particularly from California, the law's most significant test case, suggests that the real Obamacare shock may be one of unexpected success.\n\nBefore delving into the implications of this news, it is essential to clarify a crucial point: the Affordable Care Act is a conservative reform in terms of its impact on most people's healthcare. Americans who receive health insurance from their employers, Medicare, or Medicaid\u2014which is to say, the vast majority of those with any form of health insurance\u2014will see minimal changes when the law takes effect.\n\nThere are, however, millions of Americans who do not receive insurance from their employers or government programs. They can only obtain insurance by purchasing it individually, and many of these individuals are effectively excluded from this market. In some states, like California, insurers reject applicants with past medical problems. In others, like New York, insurers cannot reject applicants based on their personal medical history (community rating), leading to high premiums due to the enrollment of individuals with current health problems while healthy individuals often choose to remain uninsured.",

The president's letter, which did not mention Linick by name, stated that his removal would take effect in 30 days, according to The Associated Press.\n\nLinick, a former assistant U.S. attorney in California and Virginia who has held the Inspector General (IG) position since 2013, had overseen reports that were critical of the State Department's management policies since Trump took office. His office had also criticized several Trump appointees for their treatment of career staff for allegedly being insufficiently supportive of Trump and his policies, the AP reported.\n\nLast October, Fox News reported that Linick had hosted a closed-door briefing on Ukraine for aides from several congressional committees. The briefing examined communications between Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin and current Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko. Linick also shared news clips and information regarding Ukrainian energy company Burisma, Fox reported.\n\nThe conversations between Giuliani and the Ukrainians were in reference to reports that former Vice President Joe Biden had sought to have Shokin fired amid an investigation into Burisma, whose board members included Hunter Biden, son of the former vice president. President Trump's July 2019 request that Ukraine's president investigate the Biden matter led to the House impeaching the president last December on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted Trump in February.\n\nDemocrats in Congress immediately cried foul, with the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee suggesting that Linick was fired in part in retaliation for opening an investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\"This firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the secretary of state, from accountability,\" said Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., in a statement. \"I have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick's firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation.\"\n\nEngel offered no details of the alleged investigation into Pompeo, although two congressional aides told the Associated Press the investigation involved allegations that Pompeo may have improperly treated staff.\n\nLinick's removal continues a series of changes among the government's inspectors general. In April, Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, for his role in the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump's impeachment. Then Trump removed Glenn Fine as acting inspector general at the Defense Department, a move that stripped him of his post as chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. That panel is charged with overseeing the allocation of more than $2 trillion in coronavirus relief funding.\n\nDuring a White House briefing on the coronavirus, Trump questioned the independence of an inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services over a report that said there was a shortage of supplies and testing at hospitals.\n\nWhen Linick departs, he will be replaced by Stephen Akard, a former career foreign service officer with close ties to Vice President Mike Pence, a Trump administration official told the AP. Akard currently runs the department's Office of Foreign Missions. He had been nominated to be the director general of the Foreign Service but withdrew after objections he was not experienced enough.\n\n\"The president must cease his pattern of reprisal and retaliation against the public servants who are working to keep Americans safe, particularly during this time of global emergency,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement. Pelosi claimed Linick was being \"punished for honorably performing his duty to protect the Constitution and our national security.\"\n\nRep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested Linick was fired in part in retaliation for opening an unspecified investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \"This firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the secretary of state, from accountability,\" Engel said in a statement. \"I have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick's firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation.\"\n\nEngel offered no details of the alleged investigation into Pompeo, but Linick's office had issued several reports critical of the department's handling of personnel matters, including accusing some of Trump's appointees of retaliating against career officials.",
    " Title: California Attorney General Considering Action Against Officials Defying Sanctuary City Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra has stated that he is considering taking action against officials who are defying the state's sanctuary city laws. During a news conference, Becerra emphasized his duty to enforce state law, stating, \"State law is state law. It's my job to enforce state law, and I will do so.\"\n\nWhen asked if this stance meant potential legal action against a sheriff who announced her department would cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by publishing inmate release dates through an online database, Becerra did not provide a direct response.\n\nOrange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchins, in a statement on Tuesday, defended her department's decision, stating that it \"will enhance communication between the Sheriff's Department and our law enforcement partners to remove dangerous offenders from our community.\"\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed Sheriff Hutchins, expressing concern over the attorney general's statement, stating, \"You are chief law enforcement officer of the county. The attorney general is threatening to arrest you.\" Hutchins responded, \"I don't think he understands what the law says. What I'm doing is entirely within the confines of the law, and I'm doing what I think is important for my constituents. It's a public safety issue to me. It's not about immigration at all. It's about individuals who have committed violent crimes.\"\n\nFollowing the Sheriff Department's statement, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted 3-0 to join the Department of Justice's lawsuit against California over three of the state's recent immigration laws. Supervisor Shawn Nelson stated before the vote, \"This legislation prevents law enforcement from removing criminals from our community and is a threat to public safety.\"",
    " Title: FBI Obtains FISA Warrant to Monitor Carter Page, Trump Campaign Advisor\n\nArticle:\n\nThe FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of Carter Page, an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump, as part of an investigation into possible links between Russia and the campaign. The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Page's communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThis development marks the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump's favor.\n\nPage has not been accused of any crimes, and it is unclear whether the Justice Department might later seek charges against him or others in connection with Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The counterintelligence investigation into Russian efforts to influence U.S. elections began in July, officials have said. Most such investigations don't result in criminal charges.\n\nThe officials spoke about the court order on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of a counterintelligence probe. It is also unclear whether the FBI's surveillance of Page captured any evidence of wrongdoing or collusion with the Russian government.\n\nIn a separate development, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, first unveiled the news of the unmasking in a short press conference last month, where he later briefed the White House on the find. The move was seen as controversial, with members of the committee crying foul that they were not shown the documents that Nunes said revealed this information.\n\nNunes also viewed these documents on White House grounds, where two staffers aided in a navigational capacity since intelligence services were reportedly stonewalling Nunes. While the two White House staffers did not turn out to be his direct sources, the optics were bad, and the damage was done.\n\nIt is also reported that the person who requested the unmasking was high up the food chain in the intelligence community, not a member of the FBI, and well known. That person was Susan Rice, who said last month on PBS that she had no clue about the leaks. Now, she says that unmasking was part of the job; she changed her story. Rice isn't exactly an arbiter of truth either. She lied about the nature of the 2012 Benghazi attack, which she said was due to a spontaneous reaction to a YouTube video when in fact\u2014the administration knew that this was a coordinated terrorist attack by a group affiliated with al-Qaeda.\n\nBoth GOP and Democratic House Intelligence committee members have looked at the documents that Nunes and ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) looked at and concluded that there doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary (or illegal) even with Rice's unmasking request. However, both the House and Senate probes seem to be set on calling Ms. Rice in for further questioning.\n\nAs of right now, there is no definitive proof that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, according to Rep. Adam Schiff himself last week. FISA warrants are almost never turned down, so it's apparent that the threshold is rather low. What is absolutely true as of right now is that there is no definitive proof that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.",
    " Title: Islamic Militant Group Gains Control of U.S. Embassy Compound in Tripoli, Libya\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Islamic militant group, the Dawn of Libya, has reportedly taken control of the U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli, Libya's capital city. American personnel evacuated the area approximately a month ago due to ongoing fighting in the country. An Associated Press journalist was granted access to the compound on Sunday, following an invitation from the Dawn of Libya.\n\nUpon inspection, the compound showed signs of vandalism, with broken windows, but most of the equipment appeared untouched. The breach of the diplomatic post may reignite debate in the U.S. regarding its role in Libya, more than three years after supporting rebels who overthrew dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nA commander for the Dawn of Libya group claimed that their forces had been in control of the compound since last week. In response, a senior State Department official stated, \"We've seen the reports and videos and are seeking additional details. At this point, we believe the Embassy compound itself remains secure, but we continue to monitor the situation on the ground, which remains very fluid.\"\n\nThe official also noted that the U.S. Ambassador and other officials remain engaged, both in Washington and from the U.S. Embassy in Valletta, Malta, where embassy staff from Tripoli were recently relocated. No U.S. military or assets were guarding the property after the State Department's withdrawal.\n\nOn September 11, 2012, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, and State Department information management officer Sean Smith were killed in a terror attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya. A video posted online showed men playing in a pool at the compound. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones stated that the video appeared to have been shot in the embassy's residential annex.\n\nHowever, two sources with first-hand knowledge of the embassy and other U.S. facilities in Libya claim that the YouTube video in which the militia members are diving from a roof into the pool was taken at the CIA annex in Tripoli, which was abandoned when U.S. Embassy personnel and the ambassador evacuated on July 26. It is approximately a mile away from the U.S. Embassy in Libya.\n\nWhen the CIA abandoned the annex in July, it would no longer be considered sovereign U.S. territory. Jones also stated that the compound appears to be \"safeguarded,\" not \"ransacked.\" The fighting prompted diplomats and thousands of Tripoli residents to flee. Dozens were killed in the fighting. On July 26, U.S. diplomats evacuated to neighboring Tunisia under a U.S. military escort. The State Department announced that embassy operations would be suspended until the security situation improved. The Dawn of Libya militia has called on foreign diplomats to return now that the fighting has subsided.",
    " Title: High School Student Speaks Out, Denies Allegations of Racial Taunting at Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nNick Sandmann, a junior at Covington Catholic High School, has broken his silence regarding the viral video showing a confrontation between Native American protesters and his classmates at a Washington rally. In a statement released Sunday evening, Sandmann claimed that his classmates were taunted by a group of African-American protesters before the viral clip was recorded. He also stated that he and his family have received death threats.\n\nSandmann, who was one of the students seen in the viral video, said, \"I am mortified that so many people have come to believe something that did not happen -- that students from my school were chanting or acting in a racist fashion toward African Americans or Native Americans. I did not do that, do not have hateful feelings in my heart, and did not witness any of my classmates doing that.\"\n\nThe initial accusations were made against the students, who were wearing \"Make America Great Again\" apparel, for allegedly mocking a Native American participant in the Indigenous Peoples March. A brief clip of the apparent confrontation quickly spread on social media, with many condemning the students and some calling for their identification and harassment. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington and the high school issued a joint statement apologizing to the activist, identified as Nathan Phillips, on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the emergence of longer video that appears to show some students being harassed by a group of protesters has led some conservatives to retract their earlier criticisms of the students.\n\nAccording to Sandmann, his classmates had taken part in the March for Life and had arrived at the Lincoln Memorial to wait for the buses that would take them back to Kentucky. However, Sandmann said, the students were confronted by four members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, who allegedly called them \"racists,\" \"bigots,\" \"white crackers,\" \"f-- -ts,\" and \"incest kids.\" They also reportedly taunted an African-American student from his school by saying they would \"harvest his organs.\"\n\nSandmann said one of the students asked a teacher chaperoning the trip for permission to \"begin our school spirit chants\" to drown out the hecklers. In one chant, the group appeared to perform the haka, a traditional Maori dance. Marcus Frejo, a member of the Pawnee and Seminole tribes who witnessed the chant, said he considered it mockery.\n\n\"At no time did I hear any student chant anything other than the school spirit chants,\" Sandmann said. \"I did not witness or hear any other students chant 'build that wall' or anything hateful or racist at any time. Assertions to the contrary are simply false.\"\n\nAt that point, Phillips approached the group with his drum and, according to Sandmann, \"locked eyes with me and approached me, coming within inches of my face\" and \"played his drum the entire time he was in my face.\" Sandmann said he remained \"motionless and calm\" to de-escalate the tense situation. He also denied taunting Phillips by making faces at him, but said he smiled at the protester \"because I wanted him to know I was not going to become angry, intimidated, or be provoked into a larger confrontation.\"\n\nFor his part, Phillips told The Associated Press Sunday that he was trying to keep the peace between the students and members of the group who were heckling them. He also insisted that the students were making disparaging remarks about Native Americans.\n\n\"They were making remarks to each other... (such as) 'In my state those Indians are nothing but a bunch of drunks.' How do I report that?\" he said. \"These young people were just roughshodding through our space, like what's been going on for 500 years here -- just walking through our territories, feeling like 'this is ours.'\"\n\nFrejo said he joined Phillips to de-escalate the tense situation, singing the anthem from the American Indian Movement with both men beating out the tempo on hand drums.\n\n\"I am being called every name in the book, including a racist, and I will not stand for this mob-like character assassination of my family's name,\" Sandmann said. \"... One person threatened to harm me at school and one person claims to live in my neighborhood. My parents are receiving death and professional threats because of the social media mob that has formed over this issue.\"",
    " Title: American Health Care Act Fails: An Analysis of the Failed Legislation and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Health Care Act (AHCA) has failed to pass in the U.S. House of Representatives, marking a significant setback for the Republican Party and President Donald Trump. The bill, which aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), faced opposition from both Democrats and a significant number of Republicans.\n\nThe AHCA was criticized for its potential to leave 24 million people without insurance and increase deductibles for millions more, while providing tax cuts for millionaires. Michael Needham, head of the conservative Heritage Action, described the bill as \"an awful bill that will impact millions of Americans' lives and is opposed by nearly every serious conservative health care analyst.\"\n\nRepresentative Mo Brooks, a conservative Republican from Alabama, stated, \"I will vote against the American Health Care Act because it has more bad policy than any bill I have ever faced.\" David Brooks, in his Friday column, wrote, \"This bill takes the most vicious progressive stereotypes about conservatives and validates them.\"\n\nThe failure of the AHCA is seen as a significant legislative and tactical failure for Speaker Paul Ryan, who took charge of the process and failed to create legislation that could pass. Some bills fail even though the party faithful love them, but the AHCA was not one of those. Republicans were glad to see it die.\n\nBeyond the legislative and tactical deficiencies, the AHCA reflected a deeper failure of moral and policy imagination. Ryan, who had promised to repair the Republican Party's relationship with the poor, presented a plan that was widely criticized as inadequate.\n\nThe limits of Donald Trump's attention span were on display throughout the AHCA's short life. He never bothered to learn enough about the AHCA to make a persuasive case for it, which is part of the reason it failed. Trump's strategy of blaming Democrats for the bill's failure is unlikely to be effective, as he never attempted to gain Democratic support.\n\nRepublicans would be wise to reflect deeply on what happened and reconsider their approach to policy-making and governing. As Jonathan Chait writes, \"Republicans have spent eight years fooling themselves about Obamacare... Their attacks on Obamacare have been opportunistic and cynical in ways that made its replacement nearly impossible.\" Big policy change is hard, and the modern Republican Party has built itself in opposition, often ignoring the successes of the policies they criticize.",
    " Title: 39 Bodies Found in Truck in England; Driver Arrested on Suspicion of Murder\n\nGRAYS, England (AP) \u2014 Authorities found 39 people dead in a truck in an industrial park in England on Wednesday, in one of Britain's worst human-smuggling tragedies. The truck and the trailer with the people inside apparently took separate circuitous journeys before ending up on the grounds of the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of London on the River Thames.\n\nPolice were reconstructing the final journey of the victims as they tried to piece together where they were from and how they came to be in England. The truck and its driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, were arrested on suspicion of murder. The truck was registered in Bulgaria to a company owned by an Irish citizen, according to Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry. The Belgian federal prosecutor's office has opened an investigation.\n\nAmbulance workers discovered the bodies after being called at 1:40 a.m. It was unclear who called the ambulance service. No cause of death has been made public, and police have not released further details about the victims. The number of victims was shocking, although it has become sadly common in recent years for small numbers of migrants to occasionally be found dead in sealed vehicles after having been abandoned by traffickers.\n\nThe tragedy recalls the death of 58 migrants in 2000 in a truck in Dover, England, and the deaths in 2015 of 71 migrants from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan who were found suffocated in the back of a refrigerated truck that was abandoned on an Austrian highway close to the Hungarian border. Groups of migrants have repeatedly landed on English shores using small boats for the risky Channel crossing, and migrants are sometimes found in the trunks of cars that disembark from the massive ferries that link France and England.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said its specialists were working to \"urgently identify and take action against any organized crime groups who have played a role in causing these deaths.\" It said in May that the number of people being smuggled into Britain via cargo trucks was on the rise.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and further details about the victims and the truck's journey are still being pieced together.",
    " Title: Jersey City Shooting Highlights Challenges in Controlling Gun Trafficking Across State Borders\n\nArticle:\n\nTRENTON, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The fatal attack on a Jewish market in New Jersey has highlighted the challenges in controlling gun trafficking across state borders, as officials from states with strong gun restrictions call for stricter firearm control in places with weaker laws.\n\nThree civilians and a police officer were gunned down Tuesday by two killers with anti-Semitic and anti-law enforcement beliefs, according to the state's attorney general. The attackers carried five firearms and a pipe bomb in the U-Haul van they drove to the Jersey City Jewish market before opening fire, officials said. Two of the weapons used by David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, were bought by Graham in Ohio last year, police said. It's unknown where they got the three other guns.\n\nNew Jersey is among the states with the toughest gun restrictions in the country, and in the past two years, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has signed over a half-dozen new restrictions into law, including a lower bullet limit for gun magazines and a red flag law. He's also made a priority of highlighting the so-called iron pipeline of firearms from other states, particularly along the Interstate 95 corridor. Murphy, for example, is requiring state police to publish data monthly on guns recovered from crimes. The data shows nearly 80% of so-called crime guns are from out of state.\n\nMurphy says it's important to \"name and shame\" states with weaker gun laws that effectively import weapons into New Jersey. And in California, its Democratic governor and attorney general this year both criticized the continued ability to bring in illegal firearms from other states despite California's strict gun laws.\n\nFor years, Chicago officials have complained that street violence often comes from the muzzles of guns sold in states with less-stringent laws. Officials there and elsewhere have renewed demands for gun control at the federal level.\n\n\"It keeps happening, over and over and over again, on their damn watch,\" California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said of federal politicians. \"I can't put borders up in a neighboring state where you can buy this damn stuff legally.\"\n\nFederal legislation is the missing factor, agreed Murphy's top gun adviser.\n\n\"If we're being honest, New Jersey is not an oasis and that's why it's extraordinarily frustrating,\" said Bill Castner. \"We will continue to push and identify the most aggressive actions, but without a federal solution, it's extraordinarily challenging.\"\n\nShannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said her group is pressing ahead with state-level gun control because of the political headwinds in Washington.\n\n\"What we have to do until we have the right president and Congress is go state by state,\" Watts said in an interview. \"That's what we have to do now because of the political makeup. Every state is only as safe as the closest state with the weakest gun laws.\"\n\nSecond Amendment advocates, though, push back on the need for tougher state and national laws. Scott Bach, the executive director of the New Jersey Association of Rifle and Pistol Clubs, an affiliate of the NRA, invoked a common criticism of tougher restrictions: criminals break laws, they don't follow them.\n\n\"Criminals laugh at gun regulations \u2014 the only thing they understand is severe punishment for actual gun crime,\" Bach said.\n\nOfficials are still investigating the Jersey City attack and have yet to release details about how the deceased attackers obtained their weapons.",

The test took place after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to continue conducting missile tests in the Pacific.\n\nThe USS John Paul Jones detected and tracked a missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai with its onboard radar before intercepting it with SM-6 missiles, according to the MDA. This marks the second successful interception of a medium-range ballistic missile by an SM-6 missile in a test.\n\nMDA Director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves described the test as a \"key milestone.\" He stated, \"We will continue developing ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis is scheduled to meet with South Korea's Defense Minister Song Young-moo at the Pentagon on Wednesday. The two will discuss possible responses to North Korea's provocative actions, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.\n\nNorth Korea released images of its intermediate-range ballistic missile launch over Japan on Wednesday, a day before the test. The official Korean Central News Agency reported that the Hwasong-12, the first missile the nation has fired over Japan, was \"guided\" by leader Kim Jong Un and observed by senior officials.\n\nThe launch of the intermediate-range rocket traveled nearly 1,700 miles and reached a maximum height of 341 miles as it flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido early Tuesday, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, described the test as an \"unprecedented, grave threat.\"\n\nKim Jong Un stated that \"more ballistic missile rocket launching drills\" are \"necessary\" to modernize his military's strategic capabilities and that his country will continue to observe \"U.S. demeanors\" before deciding on future actions. Kim expressed \"great satisfaction\" with what he called a \"meaningful prelude\" to containing the U.S. territory of Guam, which he has threatened to fire four missiles toward.\n\nPresident Trump warned Tuesday that \"all options are on the table\" in response to North Korea's latest missile launch. A military response seems unlikely, according to security analysts.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council \"strongly condemned\" the missile test and North Korea's launching of three ballistic missiles into the sea on Aug. 25. It demanded that Pyongyang \"immediately cease all such actions\" in a statement following an emergency meeting Tuesday. It did not announce new sanctions.\n\nChoo Mi-ae, the head of South Korea's ruling Democratic Party, urged Pyongyang to accept its offer of dialogue and stated, \"Such an act that threatens neighboring nations is unpardonable.\" Choo added, \"If North Korea trusts South Korea's government and holds its hands, the door will open for its survival. Otherwise, it will face more serious isolation.\"\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that China will \"fully and completely\" abide by U.N. Security Council sanctions and will work with other council members on how best to react to North Korea's latest action. \"We will make a necessary response,\" Wang said. China, North Korea's most important ally, accounts for about 90% of the North's foreign trade.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May called on China to put more pressure on North Korea, as she arrived in Japan for a three-day visit Wednesday. \"We think that China has a role to play and we'd encourage China to do everything it can to bring pressure on North Korea to stop this,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 10 companies and six individuals from mostly China and Russia who it says helped North Korea develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. They were the latest in a raft of blacklists issued in recent months to punish Chinese and Russian companies that try to evade international efforts to isolate North Korea.",

The bomb detonated near a football pitch in Nadir Shah Kot district on Monday afternoon, as reported by the provincial governor's spokesman, Talib Khan Mangal, to Afghan media.\n\nThe bombing occurred after the Taliban announced the resumption of offensive operations against Afghan security forces, ending the \"reduction in violence\" agreement that preceded the signing of a deal between the armed group and the United States. Under the deal signed on Saturday, foreign forces will withdraw from Afghanistan within 14 months, subject to Taliban security guarantees and a pledge by the group to hold talks with the Kabul government.\n\nThe four-part agreement sets March 10 as the date for an intra-Afghan dialogue, as well as a prisoner swap, which would see the government release 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban release 1,000 captives. However, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani stated on Sunday that \"the government of Afghanistan has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners.\"\n\nIn response, the Taliban stated on Monday that it would not take part in intra-Afghan talks until the prisoners were released. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters news agency, \"We are fully ready for the intra-Afghan talks, but we are waiting for the release of our 5,000 prisoners.\" Mujahid added, \"If our 5,000 prisoners - 100 or 200 more or less does not matter - do not get released, there will be no intra-Afghan talks.\"\n\nCommander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, US General Scott Miller, stated that the United States expected the Taliban to \"be very serious\" about its obligations.

The unidentified soldier, who has been involved in the training of indigenous forces on multiple continents, told Fox News that Turkey is not adhering to the agreed-upon security arrangements and that the SDF has met every single agreement with no threat to Turkey from their side of the border.\n\nPresident Trump announced on October 6 that U.S. troops would withdraw from the area in anticipation of Turkey's offensive, removing the chief deterrent to Ankara's operation. The decision has sparked controversy in Washington, with some lawmakers expressing concern about the potential for an ISIS comeback and a stain on America's honor for abandoning the Kurds.\n\nTurkey has long viewed Kurdish groups in northern Syria, which have worked with the U.S. in the fight against ISIS, as linked with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a terrorist organization labeled as such by both Washington and Ankara. Reports have emerged of several civilian casualties since Turkey's military operation began, with the U.S. soldier telling Fox News that the U.S. president \"doesn't understand the problem\" and the repercussions of the withdrawal.\n\nDefense officials have expressed concerns that the offensive against the SDF could lead to the inadvertent release of several ISIS members that the SDF is detaining. Trump confirmed on October 10 that the U.S. had taken custody of two ISIS militants believed to be part of an execution unit in case the Kurds or Turkey \"lose control.\" The U.S. has already taken the two ISIS militants, known as the Beetles, out of Syria and into a secure location controlled by the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. service member stated that the current situation is not helping the ISIS fight and that many of the ISIS prisoners \"will be free in the coming days and weeks.\"",

The tradition involves airing grievances.\n\nPaul, a Kentucky Republican, expressed his discontent with politics in Washington, D.C., through a series of tweets. His grievances ranged from criticisms of the Federal Reserve and the recently passed bipartisan budget, to more lighthearted complaints such as the food in the Senate cafeteria and the D.C. street cleaning schedule.\n\nIn one tweet, Paul criticized the concept of bipartisan deals in Washington, stating, \"In Washington, 'bipartisan deal' is a synonym for 'increasing our debt.'\" He also expressed dissatisfaction with his fellow Senator Cory Booker for not retweeting him enough.\n\nIn response, Booker tweeted, \"U, me & 'feats of strength': Senate floor, name the time,\" referencing a \"Seinfeld\" episode where the characters engage in a \"feats of strength\" contest.\n\nPaul also called for more debate and amendments in the Senate, and criticized changes to the rules that he perceived as an \"iron fist\" approach. He lamented the absence of burgoo, a traditional Kentucky dish, in the Senate cafeteria, and expressed frustration over his staff altering his wardrobe, particularly a turtleneck sweater.\n\nAdditionally, Paul voiced minor grievances about remembering the D.C. street cleaning schedule and the impact of Federal Reserve policies on the economy, particularly on the poor and middle class. \"Fed policies make you poorer,\" he tweeted, \"and hurt the poor and middle class the most.\" He also attributed high grocery and gas bills to Federal Reserve policies.\n\n\"Seinfeld\" writer Dan O'Keefe weighed in on Paul's reference to the show the following day.",

Mnuchin stated, \"In reliance on the advice of the Department of Justice, I have determined that the Committee's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose, and pursuant to section 6103, the Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.\"\n\nNeal initially requested Trump's 2013-2018 tax returns from the IRS, which is part of the Treasury Department. He invoked a law allowing a select few members of Congress to review individual tax returns for legislative purposes and cited legislative proposals and oversight related to federal tax laws as his basis for the request.\n\nThis is the first such demand for a sitting president's tax information in 45 years. Neal also demanded copies of tax returns for Trump's trust and for his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nThe subpoena is part of a broader effort from Congress to obtain documents and bring administration officials and allies in for questioning. On Wednesday, the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr. to answer more questions. Earlier that day, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress over his refusal to hand over an unredacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
    " Title: Secretary Clinton Takes Responsibility for Benghazi Consulate Attack, Denies Cover-up\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton took responsibility on Monday for any security failures leading up to the consulate attack last month in Libya that resulted in the death of the American ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans. However, she pushed back against claims of a cover-up, attributing the Obama administration's shifting explanations for the attack to the \"fog of war.\"\n\nThe attack on the consulate in Benghazi occurred on September 11, 2012. Initially, administration officials suggested that the attack was \"spontaneous\" violence that grew out of protests over an anti-Islam film, rather than a premeditated attack. However, it later became clear that intelligence officials suspected terrorism almost immediately, and investigators now believe extremists tied to Al Qaeda carried out a coordinated attack, with no evidence that the attack was preceded by a protest outside the consulate.\n\nClinton attributed the administration's shifting story to \"the confusion you get in any type of combat situation.\" She stated, \"Remember, this was an attack that went on for hours. There had to be a lot of sorting out... Everyone said, here's what we know, subject to change.\"\n\nThe Obama administration, particularly the State Department, has faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill over the level of security at the consulate, with allegations that requests for increased protection were denied or ignored. This question was a prominent topic during the vice presidential debate on Thursday, when Vice President Biden denied getting any requests for increased security. The White House later clarified that Biden was speaking for himself and the president, not for the State Department.\n\nClinton seemed to back up Biden's claims, stating, \"I'm responsible for the State Department, for the more than 60,000 people around the world.\" She continued, \"The decisions about security are made by security professionals. But we're going to review everything to be sure we're doing what needs to be done in an increasingly risky environment.\"\n\nClinton also addressed the question of a June explosion at the consulate in Benghazi that some have argued should have raised a red flag about security. She stated, \"I can't speak to who knew what.\" She added, \"We knew there were security breaches and problems throughout Libya. That's something that came about as the aftermath of the revolution to topple Qaddafi, with so many militias formed, so many weapons loose... It was taken into account by security professionals as they made their assessments.\"\n\nThree Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, stated that Clinton's claim was \"a laudable gesture.\" However, they put the responsibility for the Benghazi attack and what they called \"an escalating pattern of attacks this year in Benghazi\" squarely on President Obama and his national security team. They stated, \"If the president was truly not aware of this rising threat level in Benghazi, then we have lost confidence in his national security team, whose responsibility it is to keep the president informed. But if the president was aware of these earlier attacks in Benghazi prior to the events of Sept. 11, 2012, then he bears full responsibility for any security failures that occurred.\"",
    " Title: Potential Discussions on ACA: Delay of Individual Mandate, Medical Device Tax, and Other Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the event of discussions between President Barack Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), there are limited areas of agreement due to the significant differences in their perspectives.\n\nOne of the main points of contention is the individual mandate, a requirement for individuals to obtain health insurance or face a penalty. The Republican argument, which has garnered support from some Democrats, is that if the Obama administration can delay the requirement for large employers, individuals should also receive a one-year break from the individual mandate. However, the White House is concerned that delaying the individual mandate could disrupt the balance of healthy and sick individuals in the new insurance system, potentially leading to higher insurance prices and fewer people covered.\n\nAnother potential point of discussion is the repeal of the medical device tax, a 2.3% tax on the sales price of medical devices by manufacturers and importers. This idea has won some Democratic support in the past, but it would result in a loss of $30 billion in revenue needed to fund the ACA.\n\nOther potential changes include delaying the entire law for one year, including pre-existing condition coverage, and repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a part of the health law that is not central to its operation. However, these changes would not satisfy the tea party Republicans, who seek a more comprehensive overhaul of the ACA.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans could renew their push for the repeal of the Congressional subsidies for health coverage through the Obamacare exchanges. This issue has been a point of contention, with Republicans arguing that it provides a \"special break\" for lawmakers and their staffs, while Democrats maintain that it is similar to the employer contributions lawmakers and their staffs have always received to get federal employees' health coverage.\n\nIn summary, while discussions between President Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders regarding the ACA may occur, there are significant barriers to reaching agreement on piecemeal changes that would not cripple the law, while larger changes proposed by Republicans would be nonstarters for the White House.",
    " Title: Suspect in Charleston Church Shooting Arrested in North Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nDylann Roof, the alleged perpetrator of a shooting incident at a Charleston, South Carolina church that resulted in the deaths of nine individuals, has been apprehended, authorities confirmed. The arrest took place at a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, approximately 250 miles north of Charleston.\n\nAccording to police, Roof, 21, was expected to be charged Thursday night with murder, allowing for his extradition. More charges were anticipated, as per the local prosecutor's office in communication with a local affiliate WCIV.\n\nA citizen reported Roof's car to the police, who subsequently made the arrest. Roof cooperated with the officer who stopped him, according to police.\n\nCharleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen expressed satisfaction at the swift resolution of the case during a news conference, stating, \"I am so pleased we were able to resolve this case quickly.\"\n\nThe FBI and Charleston police had earlier identified Roof, of Lexington, South Carolina, as the suspect. The shooting occurred at the historic predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on Calhoun Street, where the suspect opened fire on a bible study group, killing eight people and injuring one, who later died. Police initially reported two people hospitalized, but later clarified that only one person survived the shooting initially.\n\nThe alleged gunman, whom the mayor called a \"horrible scoundrel,\" was inside the church attending the prayer meeting with worshipers for almost an hour. The victims included three males and six females, and the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, church pastor and a South Carolina state senator, was among the dead. The other victims were identified as Rev. Sharonda Singleton, retired pastor Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, Ethel Lee Lance, Cynthia Hurd, Myra Thompson, and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders.\n\nThree people survived the shooting, but details about them were not immediately available.\n\n\"This is a situation that is unacceptable in any society and especially in our society and our city,\" Mullen said.\n\nEarly this morning, police released pictures from surveillance footage showing the suspect, a white man, approximately 21 to 25 years old, as well as the car he was driving. The suspect was described as approximately 5-foot-9, wearing a sweatshirt with distinctive markings and Timberland boots.\n\nFor real-time updates on this developing story, users can \"star\" this story in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 phone app. Download \u2588\u2588\u2588 for iPhone or \u2588\u2588\u2588 for Android.",
    " Title: Germanwings Flight 9525: Autopilot Reprogrammed, Co-Pilot's Apartment Searched\n\nArticle:\n\nGermanwings Flight 9525, a plane traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, crashed Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board. New details suggest that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, intentionally crashed the plane.\n\nAccording to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data, the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet. The plane's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds, including the captain banging on the door and screaming for several minutes before the crash.\n\nPolice searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf, Germany, on Thursday, looking for clues about his possible motive. The French government has also asked the FBI to help investigate the crash. Investigators are still baffled about why Lubitz would have crashed the plane.\n\nLubitz was a German national and had been with Germanwings since September 2013. He had completed 630 hours of flight time and had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone. He had passed medical tests, and the audio recording showed his breathing to be steady, with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue.\n\nLufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired. The company considers an applicant's psychological state when hiring, but Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr stated that the co-pilot was \"fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own.\"\n\nThe bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all DNA identification work has been done, a process likely to last several weeks. While some human remains have been recovered, many have not. The task is treacherous for search crews working on steep slopes in icy weather.\n\nThe disaster is not being described as a \"terrorist attack,\" and the killing of 150 people would not typically be described as a \"suicide.\" Lufthansa is providing \"financial support\" to relatives of the victims, and many relatives and friends of the victims have traveled to an area near the site where their loved ones perished.",
    " Title: Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson Gains Momentum Ahead of National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the unpredictable 2016 presidential election, the Libertarian Party is seizing an opportunity to make a significant impact, as voters express reservations about the likely Republican and Democratic nominees. The Libertarian Party's national convention, starting this Friday, will determine their nominee.\n\nFormer New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, heavily favored to win the Libertarian nomination, has been garnering attention recently, with at least two polls placing him in double digits against Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. One poll showed Johnson pulling 10 percent against the two major party candidates, a notable achievement for a party that has never garnered more than 1 percent of the vote in a presidential election.\n\nJohnson acknowledged that his poll numbers reflect a combination of growth among libertarians and a \"none-of-the-above\" choice for disillusioned voters. If he secures the nomination at the Memorial Day weekend convention, Johnson indicated he would aim to fill the role of Trump/Clinton alternative.\n\n\"The nominee for the Libertarian Party is going to be the only third-party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states,\" Johnson said. \"I jokingly say that if Mickey Mouse were [the] third name in any polls, the recognizable figure that he is, [he] would be at 30 percent. But Mickey is not on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n\nState ballot access will be a challenge, but Johnson, who is already on 32 state ballots, expects the party to be on all 50 state ballots by November. To appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans, Johnson has tapped another former GOP governor, William Weld of Massachusetts, as his running mate.\n\nJohnson is still short of the 15 percent needed to qualify for the presidential debates. However, he believes that if he participates in the debates, the ticket could collect electoral votes. Johnson's optimism about actually winning is tempered by reality and history, as the party has a poor track record in general elections, and Johnson's poll numbers have not always held up.\n\nIn the 2012 general election, Johnson polled at about 4 percent during the campaign but ended up with less than 1 percent of the popular vote. Still, the 1.2 million votes represented a record for a Libertarian, and if the party can build on that this year, it could be enough to influence the outcome in November \u2013 though whether the candidate draws votes away from the GOP or Democratic nominee remains to be seen.\n\nAbout 1,000 delegates are expected to gather in Orlando for the convention. Johnson, anti-virus software developer John McAfee, libertarian media publisher Austin Petersen, and 15 other candidates are among the top contenders. Johnson is not guaranteed a first-ballot victory, but if he does not win on the first round, McAfee stated, \"If Johnson does not win on the first round, it will be mine.\"\n\nWilliam Irwin, the chairman of the philosophy department at King's College, who has written books on libertarianism, most recently \"Free Dakota,\" said, \"Some predicted the libertarian moment has passed. I think the libertarian moment is now.\" However, Johnson, if nominated, could run into trouble with some conservatives while attracting liberals due to his support for abortion rights, marijuana legalization, military cuts, and a reserved foreign policy, as well as his backing for sweeping entitlement reforms, changes to the tax code, and term limits for members of Congress.\n\nJohnson and Weld, both two-term governors in the 1990s, were given A's in the libertarian Cato Institute's Fiscal Policy Report Card for cutting spending and taxes. \"Two governors running against a candidate that has never held office and another who has not held executive office \u2013 the Libertarians would be the most experienced ticket,\" Cato Institute Executive Vice President David Boaz said. \"But this year, experience isn't what people are looking for.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Army Soldier Charged with Sharing Deployment Information with Extremist Groups\n\nArticle:\n\nA U.S. Army private, Ethan Phelan Melzer, has been charged with multiple counts of attempted murder for allegedly planning to provide information about his unit's deployment to extremist groups, with the intention of inciting an attack. The charges were brought forth by a federal grand jury on Monday and carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nAccording to John Demers, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's national security division, Melzer, a 22-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, \"planned a deadly ambush on his fellow soldiers in the service of a diabolical cocktail of ideologies laced with hate and violence.\"\n\nCourt documents reveal that Melzer began communicating with followers of a violent, satanic neo-Nazi fringe group known as the Order of the Nine Angles in April. In May, he reportedly started sharing information about his Army unit, stationed in Italy, and its planned redeployment to a U.S. military base in Turkey, with the intention of inspiring a jihadist attack.\n\nThe FBI stated that Melzer unknowingly communicated with a confidential source assisting in an FBI and Army investigation while in a restricted chat room. He allegedly shared the location of a U.S. military installation, the nature of the weaponry his unit would be armed with, its vulnerabilities, the number of soldiers stationed at the base, and other details.\n\nFederal officials claim the Army thwarted the plot in late May, and the FBI arrested Melzer on June 10. He reportedly confessed to providing the information to the messaging application users to facilitate a mass casualty attack on his unit.\n\nThe Order of the Nine Angles is based in the U.K., but has gained notoriety as a source of inspiration for violent American white supremacists. Brian Levin, a terrorism expert at California State University in San Bernardino, described it as \"a decades-old extreme satanic Nazi cult whose glorification of violence and mysticism has found a renewed international audience, including some young violent American neo-Nazis.\"\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center describes the Order of Nine Angles as \"an enigmatic Satanic occult group.\" Its most extreme adherents \"promote human sacrifice, Nazism and Fascism, and Aryan myths, and have been reported to praise Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nMelzer joined the Army in 2018 and became a follower of the group in 2019, according to the Justice Department. He was deployed overseas in 2019 and was reportedly following propaganda from several extremist groups by then.\n\nAudrey Strauss, the acting US attorney in Manhattan, where the formal charges were filed, stated, \"Melzer was motivated by racism and hatred as he attempted to carry out this ultimate act of betrayal.\" No information about his defense lawyer was available at the time of publication.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Campaigns in Michigan as Likely Republican Presidential Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and the likely Republican presidential nominee, has returned to his home state of Michigan, marking the final stop on a five-day, six-state Midwestern tour. Romney, who was born in Michigan and raised in the suburbs outside Detroit, expressed optimism about his chances of winning the state in November.\n\n\"I think Michigan's a state I can win,\" Romney told reporters on his campaign plane as he left Iowa. When asked if carrying the state in November would hold special significance, Romney replied, \"If I win in Michigan, then I become the president, and that would mean a lot to me personally.\"\n\nRomney's father, George Romney, ran a car company - American Motors Corp. - and served as the governor of Michigan. George Romney unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, a prize his son is set to be officially awarded at the Republican National Convention in August. Mitt Romney launched his unsuccessful bid for the 2008 GOP nomination nearly six years ago.\n\nMichigan is one of several states that could determine the outcome in November. It is not on Romney's campaign's list of top targets, which includes traditionally Republican states like Virginia and North Carolina and swing states like Ohio and Florida. However, it is one of a number of Rust Belt states President Barack Obama won in 2008 where Romney's campaign team sees an opportunity.\n\n\"There's another level of states that are all states that Obama won last time,\" said deputy campaign manager Katie Packer Gage, a Michigan native. \"And he won't win if he doesn't win them again.\"\n\nRomney faces an uphill battle in Michigan, as there is a strong Democratic base in Detroit, and he has struggled to explain his opposition to the federal bailout that saved General Motors and Chrysler. Romney's 2012 campaign has been marked by frequent reminders of his Michigan roots, with George Romney's photo displayed on the campaign bus during the primary and supporters bringing Romney '68 memorabilia to campaign rallies.\n\nRomney has talked about his love for Vernors, a distinctive ginger ale popular in Michigan, and has affectionately referred to Michigan's trees as being the \"right height.\" During the primary campaign, Romney was criticized for his comment that his wife, Ann, drives \"a couple of Cadillacs,\" which was perceived as out of touch with Americans struggling in a bad economy.\n\nRomney's opposition to federal support for General Motors and Chrysler has been a contentious issue, and he has struggled to clarify his position. Romney has stated that he supported the managed bankruptcy that eventually structured GM, but he was opposed to facilitating it with the federal money that the Obama administration provided, and he criticized the bailouts during the primary campaign. There are already signs that he plans to soften his tone on the issue.\n\n\"He's going to acknowledge, as he has, that President Obama and he ultimately shared the same goal, which was to see the auto industry survive and thrive,\" said Gage, the deputy campaign manager. \"They just had different ways of going about it. He's pleased to see that he does seem to be getting stronger.\"",
    " Title: Five Key Points to Watch in President Obama's Second-Term State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will deliver his first State of the Union address of his second term on Tuesday, outlining his second-term agenda. Here are five key points to watch for:\n\n1. Bipartisan Progress and GOP Criticism: According to sources, the president is expected to highlight bipartisan progress on immigration reform, but he will also take the Republican Party to task on debt and tax reform. Already, Republicans are bracing for criticism.\n\n2. Balance of Jabs and Olive Branches: The number of jabs directed at the GOP and mentions of common ground will be closely monitored as a measure of the president's approach to bipartisanship.\n\n3. Forgettable Rhetoric: State of the Union addresses are often forgotten, with their focus on policy laundry lists rather than great oratory.\n\n4. Policy Priorities: The president may address a range of issues, including U.S. policy in Syria, Iran's nuclear program, and the security of U.S. diplomatic posts. Domestically, he may address poverty in the United States and issues such as U.S. use of unmanned drones, the legal rationale for targeting Americans, gay rights, women's rights, climate change, and education.\n\n5. First Lady's Fashion: Michelle Obama's outfit has become a surprise highlight of the night, with her 2009 gun-themed dress causing a stir. This year, speculation is high about whether she will bare her arms again.\n\nGiven the importance of the State of the Union address as a platform for the president to outline his priorities, it is expected that he will use the opportunity to address his critics and respond to his base on the issues mentioned above. The speech is also expected to focus heavily on economic themes.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Healthcare Reform: Grandfather Clause and Policy Cancellations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Obama Administration's health reform plan, known as Obamacare, has faced criticism over a promise made by President Obama during the health reform's promotion. The promise, \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Period,\" has been called into question as critics argue that it was unlikely to be true at the time and is now being proven false.\n\nThe controversy stems from a \"grandfathering\" provision in the Obamacare regulations. Initially, the provision allowed most Americans to keep their insurance as long as their policies were in effect as of March 23, 2010. However, the Department of Health and Human Services later narrowed this provision by stating that if any part of a policy was significantly changed since that date, the policy would not be grandfathered.\n\nBuried in Obamacare regulations from July 2010 is an estimate that because of normal turnover in the individual insurance market, \"40 to 67 percent\" of customers would not be able to keep their policy. The regulations further state that because many policies will have been changed since the key date, \"the percentage of individual market policies losing grandfather status in a given year exceeds the 40 to 67 percent range.\"\n\nThe Obama Administration's assurance that Americans could keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare now appears to have been misleading, as the Administration's own regulations led to the cancellation of many policies and the implementation of more expensive ones. The reason for these changes is the Obama Administration's new minimum guidelines for what insurance must cover.\n\nOne individual affected by these changes is Jacqueline Proctor, a 60-year-old Californian. Her new insurance plan must cover childcare and maternity care, services she will never use. Proctor's new insurance will cost \"more than twice as much\" as her old insurance.\n\nThe Obama Administration's rhetoric that the new insurance is better may not resonate with individuals like Proctor, who are facing increased costs for services they do not require. The Administration's repeated assurance that Americans could keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare, even in recent debates with Mitt Romney, now appears to have been misleading.",
    " Title: Judges' Skepticism Toward Flynn Case Dismissal Raises Questions for Justice Department\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a three-judge panel hearing on Friday, the skepticism of Judges Henderson and Rao towards the dismissal of charges against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was evident. Both judges have previously shown a tendency to interpret the law in a manner favorable to the Trump administration in other politically charged cases.\n\nThe assignment of Judges Henderson and Rao to the panel had raised the possibility that Mr. Flynn might prevail, despite many legal experts questioning the timing and validity of Ms. Powell's request for immediate intervention by the appeals court at this stage. However, all three judges seemed to agree that Judge Sullivan had the power to hold a hearing.\n\nThe Justice Department, represented by the deputy solicitor general, Jeffrey Wall, argued that this development would be detrimental to the executive branch. He described a brief submitted by former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, George B. H. Fisher, as a \"polemic,\" and expressed concern about having to defend against it. The department may be required to disclose internal deliberations, including the reason why no career prosecutor signed the motion to dismiss the charge against Mr. Flynn, in a potentially politicized atmosphere, according to Mr. Wall.\n\n\"There are real harms here, and if we know what has to happen at the end of the day, with all respect, district court should be directed to do it now rather than have some unnecessary and very harmful proceedings,\" he stated.\n\nThe arguments on Friday did not provide a clear answer regarding the consequences if Judge Sullivan were to reject the Justice Department's motion to dismiss the case. Judge Wilkinson did not take a position on whether a judge could sentence a defendant who had pleaded guilty, even if the executive branch no longer wanted to pursue the case.\n\nJudge Henderson, however, seemed to express a skeptical view of Mr. Gleeson's brief, suggesting that Judge Sullivan may have chosen an \"intemperate\" person to critique the Justice Department's move. She added that the judge may declare Mr. Gleeson's brief \"over the top\" and grant the dismissal motion in the future. The outcome of the case remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans' Healthcare Bill Fails as Three Senators Vote Against Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican-backed healthcare bill, also known as the \"Plan B,\" has failed in the Senate after three Republican Senators, including Lisa Murkowski, voted against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This development was announced by journalist Laura Litvan on July 18, 2017.\n\nThe failure of the bill marks the third \"no\" vote, with more expected to follow. The aftermath of this failure is expected to lead to a circular firing squad within the Republican party, as conservatives criticize Senators who are distancing themselves from their 2015 vote, moderates blame conservatives for sinking the previous bill, and various factions express their discontent with the leadership.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly planning to hold a \"motion to proceed\" vote on the 2015 repeal bill, despite the expected political backlash. This move could result in a significant number of GOP members refusing to allow a piece of legislation they previously voted to pass onto the floor.\n\nThe purpose of McConnell's decision to hold the vote is unclear. Some speculate that he may be using this as leverage to revive the compromise bill, while others suggest he is frustrated with his recalcitrant conference and wants to subject his members to tough votes. Alternatively, the vote could be intended to demonstrate the inability of Republican-only solutions to pass, thereby necessitating bipartisan cooperation.\n\nIn a related development, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has initiated bipartisan healthcare talks with former governors turned senators, as reported by Sam Stein. However, the anti-conservative demands from even the most moderate of Democrats could pose challenges in these negotiations.\n\nThe breadth of this failure is impressive, even by GOP standards, and the assignment of blame is not expected to go the way President Trump desires. The Republicans' inability to pass a pressing policy concern and a perennial campaign promise will not go unnoticed by voters. Washing their hands of the situation is not likely to be an acceptable course of action for the Republicans.",

Every American heart is thankful, and we\u2019re asking God to watch over you and to watch over your families.\"\n\nThe media covering his initial remarks was ushered out of the room so the President could have a personal conversation with the individuals on the call.\n\nVice President Mike Pence tweeted on Christmas Eve, \"For all who, in the coming days, will look to a manger & claim the promise announced on a Holy Night of peace on Earth & good will toward men-from the First Family, my family & families across America: Merry Christmas.\"\n\nOn December 23, Vice President Pence made a surprise visit to Afghanistan.",
    " Title: Polls Show Negative Perception of Hillary Clinton in Key Swing States\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for the 2016 presidential election, is facing a negative perception in key swing states, according to recent polls. In Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia, a majority of voters have an unfavorable view of Clinton, with 56 percent of Colorado voters, 56 percent of Iowa voters, and 50 percent of Virginia voters holding an unfavorable opinion of her. This negative sentiment is comparable to that of Donald Trump, the most polarizing Republican candidate in the poll.\n\nIn Colorado and Iowa, Clinton's unfavorable scores are close to those of Donald Trump, perhaps the most polarizing candidate on the trail and the Republican with the worst favorability numbers in the poll. By comparison, more voters rated Scott Walker and Marco Rubio favorably than unfavorably in all three states. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, was viewed more unfavorably in Colorado and Iowa, but did not have any gaps the size of Clinton's.\n\nThese negative perceptions extend beyond swing states, as well. In a June nationwide CNN poll, 57 percent of voters said they did not find Clinton trustworthy. In several swing states, voters do not think she is honest or trustworthy. In a Quinnipiac poll from June, voters in three other states\u2014Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\u2014were also more likely to find her untrustworthy than trustworthy.\n\nThe negative sentiment towards Clinton is not only due to her unfavorable ratings but also to a barrage of news stories generated since the start of the campaign. Her use of a private email server during her time at State, questions about whether Clinton Foundation donors were seeking political clout, and her evasion of the press have all contributed to a narrative of a candidate who is being less than transparent.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has said she believes voters can see through these narratives and still lend her their support. \"At the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out,\" she told CNN in June. \"I have great confidence. I trust the American voter. So I trust the American voter 100 percent, because I think the American voter will weigh these kinds of accusations.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton's campaign is not only facing a trustworthiness problem. Quinnipiac has found that in six swing states, voters are either split or negative on whether they believe Clinton cares about their needs and problems.\n\nOne pollster suggested that Clinton should have realistic expectations about changing people's minds and focus on her strengths. \"At this point, for somebody like Hillary Clinton, who's been in the public eye for so long, you're just not going to change some of these perceptions,\" said G. Evans Witt, principal and CEO at Princeton Survey Research Associates. \"You're not going to move the Republican numbers on Hillary Clinton as trustworthy. That means there's only a limited range for improvement, no matter what she does.\"\n\nOne bright spot for Clinton is her leadership skills, which pop up in state after state in these polls. Even when voters view her unfavorably, think she does not understand their problems, or say she is untrustworthy, they also view her as a strong leader. Focusing on her leadership strength could be a way for Clinton to clear a likability (or trustworthiness) hurdle.\n\nDemocratic strategist Craig Varoga suggested that Clinton should emphasize her leadership credentials and skills to make people feel that she is more trustworthy and authentic. \"The campaign should use that leadership as an opportunity to speak bluntly and authentically about the issues that actually matter to people in the country,\" Varoga said. \"If she speaks\u2014not demagogically, but speaks bluntly\u2014I think there will be a very positive reaction to that.\"\n\nVaroga added that there is one other important thing to remember when looking at any poll about how voters feel about 2016 candidates. \"This is in many ways a completely lousy time to run for president,\" he said. \"Frustration with politicians is off the charts, and that means well-established candidates like Clinton and Republican Jeb Bush are facing a testier electorate than candidates in previous races have faced.\"\n\nOverall, the polls suggest that Hillary Clinton faces a negative perception in key swing states, with voters questioning her trustworthiness and her ability to understand their needs and problems. However, her leadership skills are a bright spot, and focusing on these strengths could help her clear a likability (or trustworthiness) hurdle.",
    " Title: Conservative Political Action Conference Kicks Off with a Dozen Potential Republican Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) commenced this week, a three-day event hosted by the American Conservative Union. The event will feature a dozen or so potential Republican presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, and Ted Cruz.\n\nAccording to a series of reports on political polarization published last year, 9% of the public overall identifies as consistently conservative, with 20% of Republicans and Republican leaners falling into this category. Most of the remaining Republicans and leaners were either \"mostly conservative\" (33%) or had a mixture of liberal and conservative views (37%).\n\nHere are five facts drawn from a package of reports about consistent conservatives:\n\n1. Consistent conservatives participate in politics at higher rates than most other ideological groups. Half of consistent conservatives said they had contacted an elected official within the past two years, the highest level among the five groups. This figure was 28% for all Americans. Consistent conservatives also ranked high on other measurements of political engagement, such as donating money (26%), attending campaign events (24%), and volunteering on a campaign (12%).\n\n2. Conservatives had outsize influence in the November midterm elections. Although consistent conservatives make up only about 9% of the total adult population, they vote at higher rates than people elsewhere on the ideological spectrum. Consequently, a report published a few weeks before the 2014 midterms estimated that consistent conservatives would make up 17% of the November 2014 electorate.\n\n3. Conservatives prefer nonurban lifestyles. The research found an overwhelming preference among the most conservative Americans for nonurban lifestyles. 41% of consistent conservatives said they would live in a rural area if they could live anywhere in the U.S., and 35% picked a small town.\n\n4. When it comes to raising children, conservatives prioritize responsibility, faith, and hard work. When asked about the three most important traits to teach children, 61% of consistent conservatives cited \"being responsible,\" and about as many (59%) identified religious faith as particularly important; hard work was chosen by 44%.\n\n5. Conservatives gravitate toward Fox News. A separate Pew Research report on polarization and media habits found that 47% of consistent conservatives (and 31% of people with mostly conservative views) cited Fox News as their main source for news about government and politics; no other news source came close. Additionally, 88% of consistent conservatives said they trusted Fox News \u2013 by far the highest level of trust by any ideological group of any single news source among the 36 they asked about.",
    " Title: Obama Announces Federal Intervention to Lower College Costs and Rate Schools Based on Educational Value\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a two-day bus tour through New York and Pennsylvania, President Obama announced on Thursday a broader role for the federal government in lowering college costs. The plan involves rating schools based on their educational value and tying taxpayer money to school performance.\n\nSpeaking at the State University of New York at Buffalo, the president proposed capping student loan repayments at 10 percent of future paychecks and implementing measures to ensure students attending school on federal grants remain in school by doling out the money in installments.\n\nThe president's announcements are part of an effort to revitalize his domestic agenda, which has been stalled due to budget and partisan battles on Capitol Hill. The plan aims to make higher education more affordable and accessible, with the federal government and colleges currently engaged in a financial arms race, according to the president.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the Education Department will compile and release a scorecard of colleges that provide the best value. The formula will consider affordability, productivity, and access. Affordability will be measured by tuition costs versus the number of students taking loans or on scholarship. Productivity will be measured by graduation rates and the earnings of graduates. Access will be measured by the percentage of students who receive federal aid.\n\nBy 2018, after the scorecard has been refined, federal funding will be tailored to reward schools that accept low-income students and perform well according to the rest of the formula. The plan also encourages colleges and universities to explore new avenues of education, such as lower-cost online courses or awarding degrees based on learning outcomes rather than the number of classes taken.\n\nCongress will need to approve the president's plan to dock schools' federal funds for poor performance on the Education Department scorecard, and lawmakers will also need to pass legislation to cap student loan repayments at 10 percent of postgraduate incomes. The Higher Education Act, which is due to expire at the end of this year, will need to be debated and reauthorized.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have expressed mixed reactions to the president's plan. Rep. John Kline, Minnesota Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, agrees with the idea of promoting innovation among colleges but finds the proposed ranking system \"arbitrary\" and potentially stifling. Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, sees areas where his party can work with the president to control costs but urges the president to call on colleges to limit executive salaries. Grassley also emphasizes the importance of helping the consumer side of the equation, stating that students and parents becoming savvy shoppers would force colleges to rein in rising costs to compete for students.",
    " Title: CNN Announces Seven-Hour Climate Change Town Hall\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN has announced a seven-hour climate change town hall, scheduled for September 4th. The extended duration aims to provide each of the 10 participating Democratic presidential candidates with 40 minutes to discuss their plans to address climate change.\n\nThe town hall will be moderated by CNN hosts Wolf Blitzer, Erin Burnett, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, and Don Lemon. The candidates' appearance times are as follows:\n\n- Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro will be interviewed by CNN's Wolf Blitzer at 5 p.m. ET.\n- Businessman Andrew Yang, who will also be interviewed by Blitzer, will come on at 5:40 p.m.\n- California Sen. Kamala Harris will be interviewed by CNN's Erin Burnett at 6:20 p.m.\n- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who will also be interviewed by Burnett, will appear at 7 p.m.\n- Former Vice President Joe Biden will be interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper at 8 p.m.\n- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who will also be interviewed by Cooper, will be on at 8:40 p.m.\n- Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo at 9:20 p.m.\n- South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who will also be interviewed by Cuomo at 10 p.m.\n- Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke will appear with CNN's Don Lemon at 10:40 p.m.\n- New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will also be interviewed by Lemon and will come on at 11:20 p.m.\n\nAccording to previous CNN polls, 96 percent of Democratic voters want \"aggressive\" action taken to address climate change. The town hall was announced after the Democratic National Committee voted last week not to host a debate focused on the issue.\n\nIt is worth noting that CNN's decision to host a seven-hour town hall has been met with skepticism, as many viewers may find such a lengthy event challenging to engage with, given that three-hour-long debates are already considered long. However, the network's ratings have reportedly been declining, and this event may serve as an attempt to revive their viewership.",
    " Title: Sen. Tom Coburn Criticizes 2013 as One of the Worst Years for the U.S. Republic\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) has criticized 2013 as potentially one of the least productive years in Washington's history and \"one of the worst for the republic.\" In a piece published in The Wall Street Journal, Coburn argued that the rule of law gave way to the rule of rulers during the year.\n\nCoburn cited the disastrous rollout of President Obama's health care law and the president's broken promise, \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\" which was labeled as the \"Lie of the Year\" by the Tampa Bay Times' PolitiFact.\n\nThe senator wrote that President Obama's actions revealed a conformity to the political culture he vowed to reform as a presidential candidate. Coburn also pointed to the administration's unilateral, extralegal actions, such as delaying the employer mandate for a year and ignoring immigration and border-security laws.\n\nCoburn also noted Congress's 6 percent approval rating and wrote that its most significant action this year was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's move to change the chamber's filibuster rules. Coburn also criticized the Senate for ignoring the Constitution and appointing people without confirmation.\n\nThe senator also pointed to his annual Wastebook report, which showed the federal government funding the study of romance novels, providing military benefits to the Fort Hood shooter, and helping the State Department buy Facebook fans.\n\nCoburn concluded that the coming year presents an opportunity for Americans who hope for better governance, stating, \"Despite Washington's dysfunction, 'We the People' still call the shots and can demand a course correction.\" He ended with a call to action, saying, \"If you don't like the rulers you have, you don't have to keep them.\"",
    " Title: Deadly Easter Sunday Bombings in Sri Lanka Kill Nearly 300, Trigger Nationwide Curfew and Social Media Block\n\nArticle:\n\nNine coordinated bombings in churches, luxury hotels, and other sites across Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday resulted in the deaths of nearly 300 people and left hundreds more injured. The deadliest violence since the end of the country's civil war a decade ago, the attacks occurred primarily in and around Colombo, the capital.\n\nDefense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena described the blasts as a terrorist attack by religious extremists, and police reported the arrest of 13 suspects, though no immediate claim of responsibility has been made. Wijewardena stated that most of the bombings were believed to have been suicide attacks.\n\nThe explosions caused ceilings to collapse and windows to shatter, resulting in the deaths of worshippers and hotel guests in a series of scenes filled with smoke, soot, blood, broken glass, screams, and wailing alarms. Many victims were carried out of blood-spattered pews.\n\nBhanuka Harischandra, a 24-year-old founder of a tech marketing company from Colombo, was en route to the Shangri-La Hotel for a meeting when it was bombed. \"People were being dragged out,\" he said. \"People didn't know what was going on. It was panic mode.\"\n\nMost of those killed were Sri Lankan nationals. However, the three bombed hotels and one of the churches, St. Anthony's Shrine, are frequented by foreign tourists. Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry reported that at least 27 foreigners from various countries were among the deceased.\n\nIn response to the attacks, the Sri Lankan government imposed a nationwide curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and blocked most social media platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, to curtail the spread of false information and ease tension in the country of approximately 21 million people.\n\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed concern that the massacre could lead to instability in Sri Lanka and vowed to \"vest all necessary powers with the defense forces\" to take action against those responsible.\n\nCardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, called on the Sri Lankan government to \"mercilessly\" punish those responsible \"because only animals can behave like that.\"\n\nAccording to police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, at least 290 people were killed, and at least 500 were wounded. Gunasekara also reported that police found a safe house and a van used by the attackers.\n\nThe scale of the bloodshed recalls the worst days of Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war, during which the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group from the ethnic Tamil minority, sought independence from the Buddhist-majority country. The Tamils are Hindu, Muslim, and Christian.\n\nSri Lanka, located off the southern tip of India, is about 70% Buddhist. Scattered incidents of anti-Christian harassment have occurred in recent years, but nothing on the scale of what happened on Sunday. There is no history of violent Muslim militants in Sri Lanka, but tensions have been running high more recently between hard-line Buddhist monks and Muslims.\n\nTwo Muslim groups in Sri Lanka condemned the church attacks, as did countries around the world, and Pope Francis expressed condolences at the end of his traditional Easter Sunday blessing in Rome.\n\nSix nearly simultaneous blasts took place in the morning at the shrine and the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La, and Kingsbury hotels in Colombo, as well as at two churches outside Colombo. A few hours later, two more blasts occurred just outside Colombo, one of them at a guesthouse, where two people were killed, and the other near an overpass.\n\nThree police officers were killed during a search at a suspected safe house on the outskirts of Colombo when its occupants apparently detonated explosives to prevent arrest, authorities said.\n\nThe Shangri-La's second-floor restaurant was gutted, with the ceiling and windows blown out. Loose wires hung down, and tables were overturned in the blackened space. From outside the police cordon, three bodies could be seen covered in white sheets.\n\nForeign tourists hurriedly used their cellphones to text family and loved ones that they were okay. Visitors from around the world come to Sri Lanka to see elephants, tea plantations, ancient Buddhist monuments, and other sights.\n\n\"I had a sense that the country was turning the corner, and in particular, those in the tourism industry were hopeful for the future,\" said tourist Peter Kelson, a technology manager from Sydney. \"Apart from the tragedy of the immediate victims of the bombings, I worry that these terrible events will set the country back significantly.\"\n\nLocals who work in Sri Lanka's vital tourism industry were shocked and upset by the bloodshed.\n\n\"After so many years, we've started again,\" said Gamini Francis, 56, a long-time hotel worker. \"A lot of people are going to lose their jobs. 100% sure. It's tragic. Crazy people killing innocent people.\"\n\nSri Lankan forces defeated the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, ending a civil war that took over 100,000 lives, with both sides accused of grave human rights violations.\n\nHarischandra, who witnessed the attack at the Shangri-La Hotel, said there was \"a lot of tension\" after the bombings, but added, \"We've been through these kinds of situations before.\" He noted that his social media feed was flooded with photos of people standing in long lines to give blood.",
    " Title: Shake Shack Executives Call for Improvements to Paycheck Protection Program Amid Confusion\n\nArticle:\n\nShake Shack Inc.'s top executives, including CEO Randy Garutti and founder Danny Meyer, have called for improvements to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) following the return of a $10 million loan the burger chain received. The PPP is part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, aimed at providing financial assistance to small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a joint letter posted to LinkedIn, Garutti and Meyer expressed concerns about the application process, stating, \"The onus was placed on each business to figure out how, when, or even if to apply. The 'PPP' came with no user manual and it was extremely confusing.\"\n\nAccording to a Treasury Department information sheet, the PPP is open to any business with 500 or fewer employees. Shake Shack, with an average of about 45 workers per location, has 189 restaurants in the U.S. and nearly 8,000 workers.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has reportedly caused $1.5 million in weekly operating losses for Shake Shack, as stated in the letter. According to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts, 84% of Shake Shack's company-owned restaurants are in counties with at least 1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with none of the company's locations in a county with fewer than 50 cases.\n\nDanny Meyer, founder of Shake Shack, is also the CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group, which operates high-end restaurants such as Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Caf\u00e9, and Maialino. The business had more than 2,000 employees who were laid off when restaurants closed on March 13.\n\nThe executives suggest more funding and \"some necessary tweaks\" to the program, such as assigning a local bank to each applicant to avoid issues that arise if a restaurant doesn't have a pre-existing loan or banking relationship. The Small Business Administration announced that the program ran out of money last Thursday.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association has asked Congress for $240 billion in relief, stating that 40% of restaurants have closed, some permanently, and eight million workers have been furloughed. Before the pandemic, restaurants employed more than 12.2 million workers in the U.S.\n\nThe NRA estimates $240 billion in restaurant losses by the end of the year.",
    " Title: The Evolution of John McCain's Political Career and the Dissolution of His Fan Club\n\nArticle:\n\nThe dissolution of John McCain's old fan club, once known as McCainiacs, has led to the scattering of his supporters among various political groups, including neocons, deplorables, Clintonites, and Bernie Bros. This shift is not as unusual as it may seem, as the rebellion McCain represented in 1999 and 2000 was a reflection of the desires of the American public during that time.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Americans generally supported the policies of Bill Clinton, if not the man himself. Republicans, in their rhetoric, were careful to appeal to the center. Issues such as immigration, war, and trade were divisive, but not to the extent they would become. The jobs were not yet gone, and the events of 9/11 and the bank collapse had not occurred.\n\nRebelling against the G.O.P. establishment in 1999 meant defying the donor class on taxes and the religious right on social issues. However, by 2016, rebelling against the establishment meant defying the donor class on trade and immigration and siding with the religious right on social issues. McCain, who had become part of the establishment, saw his earlier fans sort themselves accordingly.\n\nIf McCain, at times, seemed bitter, these immense shifts may have contributed to his bitterness. Politicians, more than most people, learn to cope with swings in the public mood, but those who have enjoyed a period of marked resonance, when everything they say triggers sympathetic reverberations with the masses, have it hard when that stretch runs out. McCain was going fairly strong in 2004, but the formula of 2000 could no longer work. What remained instead were unpalatable choices. He could give up on a presidential run, or he could make nice with the Republican Party. McCain chose the latter, and from 2004 on, he became a loyal party member, lining up behind his party and president.\n\nUnfortunately, this was like chaining oneself to Three Mile Island. Both Bush and his party were becoming ballot-box poison. By the time McCain finally secured a presidential nomination in 2008, it was at exactly the wrong time. What everybody wanted\u2014peace, a break from Bush-era policies, and a fair and sensible way out of a financial crash\u2014McCain couldn't offer. What he could offer, resolute leadership in war, nobody wanted.\n\nThe campaign that year showed McCain at his best and worst. To the consternation of many Republicans, he eschewed all advice to hit Barack Obama for his association with radical preacher Jeremiah Wright. He made a proposal to the Obama campaign that the two candidates do 10 town halls together, and the idea, while self-serving, was still wonderful. McCain also stuck to his pledge, one that was broken by Obama, to use public financing for his campaign. At the same time, McCain shocked many of his admirers by picking as his running mate Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, someone exceptionally unsuited to the role. Palin's virtues (sense of humor, love of country, informality) were entirely inadequate in the face of her vices (insecurity, ignorance, self-deception), all of which were brought out under the glare of a national campaign. It made McCain look reckless and cynical.\n\nAfter 2008, McCain managed to frustrate nearly everyone. Democrats became enraged when McCain joined his fellow Republicans in partisan politics to weaken Obama. Republicans became enraged when McCain voted to confirm nominees or pass immigration amnesties. Because he broke ranks, because he was independent at one moment yet partisan the next, people tried to impose defamatory theories on him to make the pieces line up. Some Democrats found it easiest just to call McCain a phony and a hack. Some Republicans found it easiest to say McCain was actuated by sanctimony and spite. In the far-rightish world, you could even read lengthy arguments that McCain had been a stooge of the Viet Cong. Each theory had very little predictive power, however. A simpler explanation is that McCain, while at times expedient or partisan, preserved more independence of mind than is customary in his trade.",
    " Title: New York Primary Results Widen Leads for Trump and Clinton in 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have secured victories in the New York primary, marking a comeback for both candidates after their losses in Wisconsin two weeks prior. The primary, held in their home state, saw each candidate garner approximately three-fifths of the vote, significantly widening their leads among pledged delegates.\n\nThe victories in New York have opened a pathway for both Trump and Clinton to potentially secure their nominations before the conventions in July. In recent weeks, doubts had arisen as both front-runners seemed to lose momentum, with rivals promoting the prospect of open conventions in both Cleveland and Philadelphia.\n\nHowever, after New York, the pressure is on the challengers, who will find fewer opportunities to narrow the delegate gap with each passing week. The next significant opportunity to halt either Trump or Clinton may be next week, when Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware hold the next-to-last round of multistate primaries. A total of 144 delegates will be available for Republicans and 392 for Democrats.\n\nA sweep for either front-runner next week would make stopping Trump or Clinton not only daunting but mathematically infeasible. Even the chances of a second ballot at either convention would go from forbidding to remote.\n\nDonald Trump was declared the winner shortly after polls closed, tallying 60 percent of the statewide vote. When counting ended, Trump was poised to claim all 14 at-large delegates and about 75 of the 81 delegates awarded by congressional district.\n\nHillary Clinton did almost as well as Trump in percentage terms, with 58 percent, while she outpolled Trump in the raw vote by nearly half a million. She did not dominate the delegate count quite as much as Trump, but only because the Democrats divide their delegates proportionally\u2014both statewide and district by district. She took home an estimated 135 new delegates to Sanders' 104. She already had 39 of the state's 44 superdelegates (who are free to change their minds).\n\nThe outcomes may have been equally discouraging for challengers in both parties. Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, winners in Wisconsin and in a handful of caucus states that lent them momentum in the weeks since mid-March, stumbled badly in the Empire State. Both had hoped to at least limit the damage they would suffer on Trump's and Clinton's turf, while looking to friendlier venues ahead.\n\nHowever, the front-runners ran roughshod across the landscape. Cruz finished a weak third with scarcely 1 vote in 7, earning zero delegates. New York Republicans preferred Ohio governor John Kasich, who got 1 vote in 4 statewide and gained perhaps three or more delegates (his first since he won his home state a month earlier).\n\nBruising as the loss was for Cruz, it may have been just as bitter for Sanders on the Democratic side. Clinton only increased her delegate lead by about 30 in the crucial category of pledged delegates. But the real pain for her rival was the opportunity cost. Sanders' team had given it their all in New York, outspending Clinton on TV and hoping visibly for an upset\u2014or at least a narrow loss that could be spun as a moral victory.\n\nLooking ahead, Trump, with his delegate lead growing again, can look to another stretch of promising ground next week. Polls give him an edge in all five contests, with 144 delegates at stake. A sweep would greatly enhance his chances of reaching the majority of delegates needed for a first-ballot nomination (1,237).\n\nThere is an active \"stop Trump\" movement, both in social media and in the higher circles of the GOP establishment. Senators seeking re-election in swing states have been advised to stay away from Trump and even to skip the convention.\n\nCruz has been successful in certain states in placing sympathizers in delegate slots that are committed to Trump on the first ballot. The individuals who occupy those slots would be expected to defect from Trump on later ballots.\n\nHowever, all that will be moot if Trump can get close enough to the magic number that a few pre-convention deals might well put him over the top. After a win like he scored in New York, such a \"last mile\" strategy looks increasingly plausible.\n\nFor her part, Clinton was sounding equally sanguine just blocks away, telling a throng of her supporters that the race was \"in the homestretch and victory is in sight.\" She did not say it, but Sanders now needs to win 60 percent of the delegates in every contest remaining\u2014just to overtake Clinton in pledged delegates. He has no discernible path to turning around her advantage in superdelegates.\n\nNeither candidate's race is over yet. Weeks and months of pre-convention politicking remain. But after next week, it is possible that\u2014for one or both of the front-runners\u2014it will no longer be far from over.",
    " Title: Media Reaction to State of the Union Addresses: Obama and Rubio Compared\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a comparison of the media's reactions to the State of the Union addresses delivered by President Barack Obama and Senator Marco Rubio, the coverage of the two speeches revealed stark differences. If President Obama's speech could be described as a Christmas list of government investments, Senator Rubio's response was met with criticism, particularly regarding a water bottle incident.\n\nPresident Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night outlined a series of government spending initiatives, using the term \"invest\" 11 times. The media generally praised Obama's speech, with MSNBC's Ed Schultz calling it \"a stunning speech tonight,\" CNN's Jessica Yellin describing it as \"relaxed and confident,\" and Politico summarizing the media's response as \"State of the Union reaction: Media gives Obama thumbs up.\"\n\nSenator Rubio's response, however, was met with a different response. During his speech, Rubio reached off-screen to grab a bottle of water and take a drink. This action was the focus of much media attention, with MSNBC and CNN discussing the incident, as did numerous left-wing pundits. The Daily Kos founder, Markos Moulitas, described the incident as \"The sip of water laughed at world wide.\"\n\nThe media's reaction to Rubio's water bottle incident was harsh, with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow commenting on his \"big reach for the water glass,\" and Chris Matthews describing the speech as \"tinker toys\" and \"primitive.\" Former RNC head and MSNBC analyst Michael Steele also criticized the water bottle, stating, \"I did not like the water bottle.\"\n\nCNN was not much better, with anchor Chris Cuomo making a reaching joke and even mimicking Rubio grabbing for the bottle. The incident was also replayed multiple times, like a Super Bowl touchdown.\n\nIn contrast, President Obama's speech received far nicer treatment. Anchor Wolf Blitzer described the most powerful and emotional moment of the president's speech as coming near the end, when victims of gun violence stood and cheered and shed tears in the House gallery.\n\nOn Twitter, CNN media critic Howard Kurtz wrote, \"Twitter going off on Marco Rubio water bottle. Really dousing him,\" while E.J. Dionne, a Washington Post liberal columnist, Tweeted, \"Poor Marco Rubio: It was the gulp that roared. TV can be a cruel medium #sotu.\" The Nation's Greg Mitchell described it as the \"Return of the Swig Party.\"\n\nThe media's focus on the water bottle incident overshadowed the twin realities of the Obama speech - taxes and spending. Former GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told CNN that it was \"the most pro-government speech since Lyndon Johnson.\" Johnson, for those who lack Gingrich's grasp of history, made his mark expanding government with his \"Great Society\" programs.\n\nFor Rubio's part, he reminded viewers to blame Obama for the sequester and the cuts \"were his idea in the first place.\" The senator also highlighted Obama's call for a sudden huge hike in the minimum wage to $9 an hour, which would mean a 24 percent hike from the current $7.25.\n\nThe media's reaction to the two speeches highlights the differing perspectives and biases that can influence coverage of political events. While President Obama's speech was generally praised, Senator Rubio's response, particularly the water bottle incident, was met with harsh criticism. The focus on the water bottle incident overshadowed the substance of Rubio's speech and the twin realities of Obama's speech - taxes and spending.",
    " Title: Romney Accuses Media of Bias at Al Smith Dinner, Scholar Claims Media Protects Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joking manner at the Al Smith dinner, Mitt Romney took on the press, stating that some in the media have a certain bias in their reporting. \"Now I never suggest that the press is biased,\" he said, \"I recognize that they have their job to do, and I have my job to do. My job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country, and their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it.\"\n\nRomney went on to comment on the media's portrayal of events, citing examples of headlines that he found to be biased. \"Let's just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things,\" he said. \"When suddenly I pulled ahead in some of the major polls, what was the headline? 'Polls Show Obama Leading from Behind.' And I've already seen early reports from tonight's dinner. Headline: 'Obama Embraced by Catholics. Romney Dines with Rich People.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Paul Kengor, author of the book \"The Communist,\" told Breitbart News that the media's job is to protect President Obama, not to expose him. Kengor's book exposes Obama's relationship with Communist Party operative Frank Marshall Davis.\n\nFrank Marshall Davis was revealed to be the subject of Kengor's book in July 2007, when a Communist Party writer named Gerald Horne made the disclosure. Blogger Trevor Loudon wrote about the connection the same year, and AIM confirmed the identification of \"Frank\" as Frank Marshall Davis on February 18, 2008, in a column titled \"Obama's Communist Mentor.\" Davis's 600-page FBI file was released in August of that year, before the election.\n\nWhen asked by Breitbart News if any mainstream media journalists have contacted him about his definitive and exhaustive analysis of Davis and his relationship to Obama, Kengor replied, \"Are you kidding? No way. Not a chance.\" He added, \"They aren't real journalists. They're political partisans first and journalists second. They're not honest, or they delude themselves on a grand scale. They've sacrificed their noble profession to an ignoble political ideology.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign has decided not to attack media bias, even though liberal media strategies of distortion and omission can cost a Republican candidate critical voter support and in Romney's case guarantee an Obama re-election victory on November 6.\n\nTim Groseclose, author of \"Left Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind,\" told AIM in an interview with Roger Aronoff that the leftward bias of the media has shifted the political quotient of the average American by about 20 points on a scale of 100, in terms of conditioning the public to accept the Democratic Party, its candidates, and policies. This translates potentially into millions of votes.\n\nAt the AIM \"ObamaNation\" conference on September 21, pollster Pat Caddell urged Romney to openly run against \"two organizations\" - the Democratic Party and the \"mainstream media.\" He said the media have \"made themselves a fundamental threat to the democracy, and, in my opinion, made themselves the enemy of the American people,\" because they hide information that is critical to making informed decisions in a democracy.\n\nHowever, Romney told CBS News that he had no plans to challenge media bias. This approach reflects the influence of Romney adviser Ed Gillespie, who has said the campaign has a \"no whining rule\" about media coverage. \"We just deal with the facts,\" he said.\n\nGOP strategist and SuperPAC sponsor Karl Rove told a gathering of Republican donors that he has advised Romney and other Republicans not to attack Obama as a socialist or a left-winger because the charges would be met with denials. He urged a \"respectful tone\" toward the President.\n\nAlthough the media and the Republican Party establishment do not want to deal with Kengor's book, Frank Marshall Davis is the subject of the Joel Gilbert DVD, \"Dreams from My Real Father,\" being mailed to millions of households in the various swing states. The media are starting to take note of this. \"Radical Anti-Obama DVD floods Florida mailboxes\" is the headline over one story carried by a Florida television station.\n\nWhile Gilbert's theory about Davis being Obama's real father is subject to discussion and debate, his film does cite factual data about Davis's relationship with Obama and notes the existence of the 600-page FBI file on Davis. If there is nothing to hide in this relationship, Paul Kengor told Breitbart News, then why did Obama himself delete the references to \"Frank\" in the audio version of his book, \"Dreams from My Father\"? \"Obama narrates the audio version,\" Kengor notes. \"The liberals feted him with a Grammy for his sterling narration. And the back cover of the audio states, 'This abridgment has been approved by the author.'\"\n\nKengor said, \"Frank appears in every section of the memoir, all three parts, starting in Hawaii and then when Obama thinks of him later in Africa, Europe, Chicago. It's not like Frank appears only on pages, say, 15-22. He appears throughout the text. It's eerie to be reading the book in hard cover, and listening simultaneously to the audio, and see and hear everything the same, line to line, sentence to sentence, paragraph after paragraph, page upon page, and then suddenly, on a dime, out of the blue, come upon a printed sentence or paragraph that mentions 'Frank' and\u2014bam\u2014the audio suddenly skips ahead. It's chilling. It's clearly deliberate. No question about it. It's clear concealment.\"\n\nCliff Kincaid is the Director of the AIM Center for Investigative Journalism, and can be contacted at [email protected] org.",
    " Title: Italy Extends Nationwide Emergency Measures to Combat Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nItaly has extended its emergency measures, which include travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings, to the entire country. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the measures on Monday, urging citizens to stay home and seek permission for essential travel. The measures are aimed at protecting the most vulnerable, as Italy's coronavirus death toll jumped from 366 to 463 on Monday, making it the worst-hit country after China.\n\nThe number of confirmed infections also increased by 24% from Sunday, according to official figures. Cases of the virus have been confirmed in all 20 Italian regions. Mr. Conte emphasized the importance of staying at home, stating, \"We're having an important growth in infections... and of deaths.\"\n\nThe prime minister described the measures as \"I stay home,\" with people forbidden to gather in public. All sporting events, including football matches, are suspended nationwide. Schools and universities will remain closed until 3 April.\n\nOnly those with a valid work or family reason that cannot be postponed will be allowed to travel. Passengers departing on flights will have to justify themselves, as will all those who arrive by plane. There are controls at train stations to check the temperatures of passengers. Cruise ships are also forbidden to dock at various ports.\n\nEarlier on Monday, seven inmates died amid riots at prisons across the country after authorities suspended all visits as part of attempts to control the spread of the disease. The trouble began in the northern city of Modena at the Sant'Anna prison, where at least two of the dead are believed to have lost their lives to drug overdoses after they raided a prison hospital for the heroin substitute methadone.\n\nIn other incidents, detainees set fire to a cell block, then climbed onto the roof through windows and started waving banners at San Vittore prison in Milan, while dozens of inmates broke out of a prison in the southern city of Foggia during protests. Nine are still missing. There were also riots at other prisons in northern Italy and at facilities in Naples and Rome.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the threat of a pandemic is \"very real.\" As of now, the number of infections worldwide is over 111,000, with about 3,890 deaths. In other developments, everyone arriving in Israel will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced. Iran has reported 43 new deaths related to the disease in the past 24 hours. At least 237 people have died and 7,161 have been infected across the country since mid-February, although the real figures are believed to be far higher.\n\nIn Canada, the first death related to the virus has been confirmed, an elderly male patient in a care home in Vancouver, British Columbia. In France, Culture Minister Franck Riester has become the first member of the government to be infected with the virus. In the US, the number of confirmed cases now exceeds 500. A cruise ship carrying thousands of people who were stranded for days due to a coronavirus outbreak has docked at the port of Oakland, near San Francisco. Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis amid concerns about the economic cost of the outbreak.\n\nFor further information or to speak to a BBC journalist, please contact us via the following methods: [contact information].",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Modest Shift Toward Merit-Based Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, the Trump administration unveiled an immigration plan aimed at reshaping the United States' immigration policy, prioritizing merit-based immigration and high-skilled labor over family-based immigration. The plan, while a modest improvement over the administration's previous restrictive immigration policies, is far from comprehensive or sufficient.\n\nThe plan's central focus is a shift toward a \"merit\" system similar to those in place in Australia and Canada. The reform would increase skill-based immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent, while decreasing family-based and lottery-based immigration by 50 percent. This shift is expected to benefit employers seeking high-skilled workers, as the cap for H-1B visas (for temporary, skilled workers) and employment-based green cards has not increased for many years, while the U.S. workforce has grown by 38 million since these programs' inception.\n\nDuring his testimony before the House Committee on Small Business, my colleague Daniel Griswold advised members of Congress that increasing the number of high-skilled workers is crucial for serving the booming economy, particularly the tech and healthcare industries, as well as future American businesses, large and small. Griswold suggests tripling the number of H-1B visas to 195,000 and doubling the 1990 cap of 140,000 employment-based green cards.\n\nGriswold also recommends exempting spouses and minor children of the primary green card worker from the cap to preserve family units without taking away from the ability to attract more workers. Additionally, he suggests repealing the per-country quotas on green cards, which he argues counterproductively discriminate against immigrants based on their country of origin.\n\nThe Trump administration's plan maintains current immigration levels, which may seem counterintuitive given the need for more immigrants. However, this approach is better than the administration's previous proposals to cut legal immigration in half. The plan faces criticism for failing to enhance legal immigration of low-skilled workers, despite the benefits of importing labor, and for not addressing the issue of \"Dreamers\" and the current illegal population.\n\nWith the Democrats unwilling to give any proposals coming from the administration a chance on the House floor, including this one, the proposal is better understood as a political document than a serious legislative proposal. As such, it fails to be aspirational and implement a comprehensive and needed immigration plan. Yet, it should be commended for putting an end to the narrative about scaling back legal immigration.",
    " Title: Comey Suggests Trump May Have Committed Indictable Offenses, Potential for Post-Presidency Indictment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a CNN town-hall-style meeting on Thursday, former FBI Director James B. Comey suggested that President Donald Trump may have committed crimes that could lead to indictment once he leaves office. He stated that, were Trump not the president, he likely would already have been indicted.\n\nWhen asked by host Anderson Cooper whether Trump acted with corrupt intent to interfere with an ongoing investigation, Comey replied, \"It sure looks that way.\" He based this judgment on his reading of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, particularly Trump's order to White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller.\n\nWhen asked whether he agreed with an open letter from numerous federal prosecutors that Trump would already have been indicted on obstruction of justice charges if he were not the president, Comey was emphatic. He noted that it has been a longstanding Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr has stated that Mueller's decision not to charge Trump was not solely based on this policy. When the question of indicting a president arises, it poses an awkward question, according to Comey. He suggested that Mueller, in writing his report, seemed to be balancing Justice Department policy with building a factual record that could be used in other circumstances, such as Congress's power to impeach a president.\n\nContrary to his statements on Thursday that corrupt intent could be inferred about Trump for his actions, Comey declined to bring charges against Hillary Clinton because, he said, such intent could not be proven.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump could be indicted in 2021 or 2025 when he is no longer president, Comey said that was a possibility. \"The Justice Department will have to take a serious look at that,\" he said.\n\nComey also dismissed another defense of Trump\u2014that the president, by definition, cannot obstruct justice by exercising his legitimate constitutional powers to run the executive branch. \"The president is not above the law,\" he said, calling the theory pushed by, among others, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz \"crazy and a recipe for lawlessness.\"",
    " Title: Trump Claims Unbriefed on Alleged Russian Bounty Intelligence\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has claimed that he was not briefed on intelligence about a Russian unit offering bounties on American service members in Afghanistan because the U.S. intelligence community deemed the information not credible. Trump's statement came in a late-night tweet on Sunday, where he also suggested that the details of the intelligence, first reported by The New York Times on Friday, may have been fabricated by the media to make Republicans look bad.\n\nNeither the White House nor the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have directly addressed the credibility of the intelligence as described, but have disputed the Times' account that Trump was briefed on the information. Representatives for the ODNI and CIA did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday about the president's claim that intelligence officials informed him the information was deemed not credible.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on \"Fox & Friends\" on Monday that Congress would be briefed on the matter, without offering further details on who would participate in the briefing. McEnany did not comment on the details of the intelligence but suggested that it had not been deemed \"verifiable and credible\" in denying that Trump had been briefed on the information.\n\nTrump's tweet on Sunday came shortly after The Washington Post reported that intelligence assessments concluded that the Russian payments offered to Taliban-linked militants led to the deaths of U.S. service members in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Times reported on Friday that the intelligence community concluded months ago that the Russian intelligence unit known as the GRU secretly offered payments to Taliban-linked militants for successful attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan last year. The newspaper reported that Trump had been briefed on the intelligence and that officials had deliberated potential response options but that the White House had not authorized any further action.\n\nThe revelations have prompted criticism of Trump, who has been consistently scrutinized for his friendliness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin and resistance to taking firm action against Moscow over its interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"His entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale,\" presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said during a virtual town hall on Saturday. \"It's betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm's way. It's a betrayal of every single American family with a loved one serving in Afghanistan or anywhere overseas.\"\n\nThe White House on Saturday denied that Trump or Vice President Pence was briefed on the intelligence but did not refute the accuracy of the intelligence as described by the Times and other news outlets.\n\n\"The United States receives thousands of intelligence reports a day and they are subject to strict scrutiny. While the White House does not routinely comment on alleged intelligence or internal deliberations, the CIA Director, National Security Advisor, and the Chief of Staff can all confirm that neither the President nor the Vice President were briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence,\" McEnany said in a statement.\n\n\"This does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter,\" McEnany continued.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who was recently installed in the top intelligence post by Trump, issued a statement backing the White House but did not comment on the substance of the intelligence reported by the Times.",
    " Title: President Trump Criticizes Washington State Judge Overturning Travel Ban; Judge's Ruling Blocks Enforcement of Executive Order\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday criticized the Washington state judge who overturned his travel ban, as the Justice Department's attempt to reinstate the order was rejected by an appeals court on the same day. The executive order, issued on January 27, restricts entry into the U.S. for at least 90 days for people from seven Muslim-majority countries, halts Syrian refugees indefinitely, and all refugees for 120 days.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump expressed his disapproval of the ruling, stating, \"I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\" and \"Bad!\".\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James Robart ruled on Friday that the states of Washington and Minnesota, which filed the lawsuit, had \"met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the executive order.\" Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson sued this week, challenging key parts of the order as illegal and unconstitutional. Robart granted Ferguson's request for a temporary restraining order \"on a nationwide basis\" forbidding federal employees from enforcing Trump's order.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a strongly-worded response to Robart's decision, stating that halting the travel ban \"harms the public\" and \"second-guesses the President's national security judgment.\" The Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday that it would not continue to implement Trump's order, meaning business as usual at all airports. The State Department also said it would not cancel or revoke any more visas. Last week, up to 60,000 foreigners had their visas revoked.\n\n\"Those individuals with visas that were not physically cancelled may now travel if the visa is otherwise valid,\" the State Department said. Robart stated that Trump's order is harmful to \"residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel.\"",
    " Title: Gun Control and the Role of Education in School Shootings: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent surge in discussions about gun control, particularly in the aftermath of mass shootings at schools, has sparked a heated debate. Media personalities, such as Chris Cuomo on CNN and MSNBC, have been vocal in their criticism of politicians for allegedly being influenced by gun lobby groups. However, this article will not delve into political affiliations or speculate on the motivations of individuals.\n\nThe discourse surrounding gun control has been a contentious one, with some arguing for stricter regulations and others advocating for the preservation of Second Amendment rights. In this context, it is important to consider the role of education and its impact on school shootings.\n\nThe rise in school shootings is not solely attributable to the absence of gun laws but rather the absence of a civilized culture that values and adheres to rules. The liberal elite's cherished lobby, the teachers' unions, has been a significant contributor to this crisis. Critics argue that these unions, filled with self-interested individuals, have seen their pensions grow as schools have deteriorated.\n\nBefore the rise of the teachers' unions, public schools did not require \"gun-free zones\" or large security forces. Teachers were responsible for shaping minds and souls, and discipline and rigor were the norm. However, under the ridicule of a ruling class that now treats the debased condition of schools solemnly, this discipline and rigor have vanished.\n\nThe liberal vision of gun control without self-control results in a multiplicity of laws that an increasingly depraved citizenry will not obey. The Florida shooter, for instance, violated numerous laws. Adding a few more would not have prevented the tragedy.\n\nThe multiplication of laws can only lead to the destruction of a free society, where the final solution to crime is treating everyone, both the virtuous and the vicious, as criminals. This article does not advocate for or against gun control but aims to highlight the importance of self-control and the role of civilizing institutions, particularly schools and families, in shaping society.\n\nThe conversation about gun control should focus on the capacity of citizens to respect existing laws rather than the multiplication of restrictions. In other words, the conversation should turn to the repair of civilizing institutions, starting with the most fundamental school of virtue, the family. However, this is a conversation that gun-control advocates may be reluctant to engage in, given their role in the corruption of these institutions.\n\nThis article does not take a political stance but aims to provide a neutral analysis of the role of education in school shootings and the need for self-control in the context of gun control discussions.",
    " Title: China and U.S. Agree in Principle to Roll Back Tariffs in Phase One Trade Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry announced on Thursday that Beijing and Washington have agreed in principle to roll back existing tariffs in phases if trade talks between the two countries progress. Ministry spokesman Gao Feng stated that both sides have agreed to simultaneously cancel some tariffs on each other's goods, according to CNBC, citing the Chinese state broadcaster.\n\nGao added that the two sides are closer to a so-called \"phase one\" trade agreement after constructive negotiations over the past two weeks. If a \"phase one\" agreement is reached, tariffs already increased would be canceled at the same time and by the same rate, according to Gao. The size of the reductions would depend on the agreement's content.\n\nGao emphasized that a limited trade agreement requires the U.S. and China to remove the same amount of charges at the same time, as a key condition. The news of a \"phase one\" trade agreement prompted US stock index futures to rally Thursday morning, with Dow futures poised to open more than 120 points.\n\nThe two governments have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods in a dispute over China's trade surplus and technology ambitions. These tariffs have weighed on trade and threaten to depress global economic growth, which already shows signs of slowing.\n\nPresident Trump agreed to postpone a planned tariff hike while lower-level officials worked out the details. According to the Oct. 12 agreement, China has agreed to purchase up to $50 billion of American farm goods. However, the two sides have yet to announce progress on major disagreements over technology and other issues following 13 rounds of talks.\n\nPresident Trump and President Xi Jinping were due to meet at this month's gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders in Chile, but that event was canceled due to protests. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated this week that any \"phase one\" agreement would be general and cover trade in specific areas such as soybeans and liquefied natural gas. More complex issues would be addressed in later negotiations, he said.",
    " Title: Facebook Removes Marine Corps Page Denigrating Women After Congressional Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has removed a page that allegedly denigrated women in the Marine Corps following a complaint from a House member to the Pentagon, which was seen as another example of the military's lax attitude toward sexual harassment.\n\nRep. Jackie Speier, in a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and top military brass released Wednesday, cited the page and asked officials to outline their response. The Marine Corps, in a statement released Wednesday by Capt. Eric Flanagan, stated that Marines are responsible for all content they publish on social networking sites, blogs, or other websites, and there is no tolerance for discriminatory comments.\n\nSpeier, who has pushed the Pentagon to treat sexual abuse cases with more urgency, said in an interview, \"I almost expect to see this trash. The military is not policing itself.\" It is unclear who created or updates the page. In later online posts, Speier was called a vulgar four-letter word, incorrectly called a senator, and threatened for causing the page to be taken down. Speier's office said the posts were referred to U.S. Capitol Police, which declined to comment Wednesday night.\n\nThe Marines' statement said that based on complaints received, both active-duty and reserve Marines have been involved, and all instances are referred to commands for appropriate action. Facebook removed the page Wednesday after determining the administrators were fake, said a company official speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook routinely removes pages that bully or harass people in general, the official said.\n\nSpeier wrote that the Marine Corps inspector general is aware of the site and has been monitoring it for three years. The Marine Corps statement said the inspector general has \"been dealing with complaints about social media over the past 10 years,\" but did not specifically answer questions about the site removed Wednesday.\n\nSpeier wrote that the page and others like it \"contribute to a culture that permits and seems to encourage sexual assault and abuse.\" The Marines' statement said officials have \"notified social media sites on several occasions\" of offensive content, but \"there are difficulties in identifying the individuals responsible for the offensive material due to fake accounts and pseudonyms. Social media sites are not obligated to divulge personal information to the Marine Corps.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pentagon released a report that estimated 26,000 troops had been sexually abused in 2012, up 35% since the last survey in 2010. Later Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., sent letters to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee asking them to add anti-sexual assault provisions to the 2014 defense authorization bill, which is being developed now.\n\n\"As you prepare the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, I strongly urge you to include additional legislation to ensure justice for victims of sexual assault in the military and to prevent these horrific acts against service members in the future,\" Reid wrote Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Jim Inhofe, R-Okla. \"Specifically, I urge you to eliminate the ability of military commanders to arbitrarily reverse convictions under the Uniform Code for Military Justice for sexual assault,\" Reid wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, key White House aides are scheduled to meet with a bipartisan group of about 12 members of the House and Senate to discuss potential legislation to address the issue.",
    " Title: Trump and Khan Family Controversy: A Closer Look at the Interviews and Responses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest media controversy, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has faced criticism for his response to the emotional speech delivered by the bereaved parents of Captain Humayun Khan, an immigrant soldier who died in Iraq in 2004. The speech, given at the Democratic National Convention, was a powerful rebuke, though factually incorrect in some aspects, such as the claim that the Constitution bars religious tests for immigrants.\n\nDuring interviews with Maureen Dowd of the New York Times and George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, Trump was asked to respond to the speech. In both interviews, Trump expressed a desire to hear more from Khan's wife and made comments perceived as insensitive, referring to the subordinate status of women in Islam. Trump also suggested that the Clinton campaign had scripted Khan's remarks, a claim the family later denied.\n\nThe media has been critical of Trump's response, with some outlets labeling it as an attack on the Khan family. For example, Ezra Klein of Vox.com wrote an article titled \"Donald Trump's slander of Captain Humayun Khan's family is horrifying, even for Trump.\" However, it is worth noting that similar criticisms were not leveled against Hillary Clinton when she questioned the credibility of Patricia Smith, a mother of a victim of the 2012 Benghazi attack, during the Republican National Convention.\n\nTrump has since issued statements on Twitter and his campaign website, defending his stance on radical Islamic terrorism and criticizing Clinton's role in foreign policy. He has also accused Clinton of destabilizing the Middle East, contributing to the rise of ISIS, and being responsible for the deaths of American lives in Benghazi and Libya.\n\nIn response to the controversy, Khizr Khan, Humayun Khan's father, has made the rounds of the Sunday morning shows, stating that terror has \"nothing to do with Islam.\" Meanwhile, Trump has continued to defend his immigration policies and criticize Clinton's foreign policy record.\n\nJoel B.

Rand Paul (R-KY), currently in Guatemala to perform pro-bono eye surgeries, criticized President Obama's border policies during a closed-door meeting with Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina on Wednesday. Paul stated that the main cause of the ongoing border crisis lies with the White House, not Guatemala City.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart.com, Paul said, \"I told him, frankly, that I didn't think the problem was in Guatemala City, but that the problem was in the White House in our country, and that the mess we've got at the border is frankly because of the White House's policies.\"\n\nPaul expressed support for the House bill to end Obama's deportation relief program for Dreamers and stated that the legislation would \"go a long way to fixing the problem.\" However, he criticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for not allowing votes on any bills this year, which, according to Paul, is to protect vulnerable senators from elections.\n\nPaul, a potential contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, condemned Obama for not doing enough to secure the border and stated that without a real solution at the border, there can be no reform. He also criticized Obama for offering unilateral policies without congressional approval and for not securing the border before implementing any immigration reforms.\n\nDemocrats responded to Paul's comments, calling his trip to Guatemala a campaign farce. Michael Czin, national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, wrote in a memo, \"While everyone should commend Paul for his aid work, it's unfortunate he turned a trip organized by a well-respected eye center into a crass campaign photo op.\"\n\nCzin also criticized Paul for condemning the president in the presence of a foreign leader and for voting against Democratic immigration reform legislation and opposing an emergency supplemental package to address the border crisis. Czin concluded, \"America deserves better from our elected officials\u2014especially those who want to seek the highest office in the land.\"",
    " Title: Saudi Arabia Grants Turkey Access to Consulate Amid Khashoggi Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested on Monday that \"rogue killers\" could be behind the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, following a phone call with Saudi Arabia's King Salman about the case. Trump stated that Salman offered him a \"flat denial\" in relation to Khashoggi's disappearance, a columnist for The Washington Post who was last seen in public when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey on October 2.\n\nLater on Monday, the Saudis were reportedly preparing to admit that Khashoggi died during an interrogation that went wrong, intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey, according to two sources. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left Washington for Riyadh at midday to meet with the Saudi King on Trump's orders.\n\nPreviously, Saudi authorities had maintained that Khashoggi left the consulate the same afternoon of his visit, but have provided no evidence to support the claim. Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside the consulate, says she did not see him re-emerge.\n\nTrump described King Salman's denial as \"very strong\" and said, \"It wasn't like there was a question in his mind. The denial was very strong.\" Trump continued, \"With that being said, the king firmly denied any knowledge of it. He did not really know -- maybe -- I do not want to get into his mind but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers, who knows?\" Trump added, \"We are going to try to get to the bottom of it very soon.\"\n\nCNN reporters saw Turkish investigators, including forensics officers, entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Monday evening. Saudi officials had granted permission for the premises to be searched, a Turkish diplomatic source told CNN, and police were seen cordoning off the area before investigators arrived. Turkish officials also want to search the nearby consul general's residence.\n\nTurkish authorities believe 15 Saudi men who arrived in Istanbul on October 2 were connected to Khashoggi's disappearance and possible murder. At least some of them appear to have high-level connections in the Saudi government. A source familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN on Friday that Turkish authorities have audio and visual evidence that shows journalist Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate.\n\nInternational pressure is mounting on Riyadh to explain Khashoggi's disappearance, in a case that has created a diplomatic rift between Saudi Arabia and the West. The UK, France, and Germany have demanded a \"credible investigation\" into the events, and Trump on Sunday warned of serious retribution if the Saudis were found to be behind his possible death.\n\nSaudi officials threatened to retaliate if the US imposed sanctions, but Riyadh later softened its tone. The case has also caused friction between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which has repeatedly accused the Saudis of failing to cooperate with their investigation.\n\nCCTV footage shows Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2. The agreement to allow a search of the consulate comes a day after King Salman called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the case. The two leaders agreed on a joint working group to look into the journalist's disappearance.\n\nThe Saudi official said that a royal decree was issued Friday directing the public prosecutor to conduct an internal investigation into the Khashoggi case, based on intelligence shared by Turkey with Saudi Arabia. The official said that although a joint investigation team was cooperating on the ground, the Saudi \"leadership had felt that an internal investigation was needed to make sure no stone is left unturned to unfold the truth.\"\n\nAmid the diplomatic fallout over Khashoggi's disappearance, international firms are pulling out of a high-profile investment summit. The Future Investment Initiative conference, dubbed \"Davos in the Desert,\" was due to take place later this month in Riyadh, hosted by Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe latest high-profile invitee to pull out of the conference is World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, according to a person familiar with the decision. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has also withdrawn, a spokesperson confirmed Sunday. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was still due to attend the conference. Trump said on Monday that Mnuchin has until Friday to decide whether to attend. \"He's going to make that decision,\" Trump said.\n\nThe BBC reported that the attendance of British Trade Secretary Liam Fox was in doubt. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considered delaying the Saudi investment conference until after the investigation, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. It is unclear if that is still under consideration, according to the source. CNN received no response when reaching out to the CEO, managing director, and organizers of the conference.\n\nSaudi Arabia has found support in a number of Arab allies, including Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, which all put out statements Sunday saying they expressed solidarity with Saudi Arabia. The Palestinian Authority also put out a statement of support.",
    " Title: President Trump Faces Pressure to Remain Cautious Amidst Russia Investigation Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller's unveiling of indictments and plea deals in the Russia investigation, President Donald Trump faces a critical decision: to remain silent or react. The indictment of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, along with the plea agreement with former Trump foreign-policy adviser George Papadopoulos, has generated negative press coverage that could potentially provoke Trump's notorious impulsive responses.\n\nThe indictment of Manafort, who allegedly engaged in shady lobbying activities, is not directly linked to the Trump campaign. The charges against Manafort, dating back to 2006, involve failure to register as a foreign lobbyist and alleged money laundering. If Manafort has information about a potential collusion scheme, there is currently no evidence to suggest this.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos' plea for lying to the FBI, however, does involve his work for the campaign. He misled investigators about the timing and nature of his contacts with Russians who proposed a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Trump, and discussed dirt on Hillary Clinton. However, Papadopoulos' role was minor, and it remains unclear if the discussions led to any significant actions.\n\nIf Trump were to fire Mueller or issue pre-emptive pardons, he would escalate a peripheral issue into a full-blown crisis. Removing Mueller would lead to the handover of all special counsel materials to Congress and potentially make Trump a lead witness in impeachment hearings. A Trump pardon of Manafort would associate the president with the lobbyist's alleged malfeasance, suggesting that Trump has something to hide.\n\nThe decision to oust James Comey, the former FBI director, appears to have been driven by Trump's frustration over Comey's refusal to publicly state that Trump was not under investigation. If Trump repeats this impulsive action by firing Mueller or issuing a barrage of pardons, he risks making the situation much worse for himself. Conversely, if Trump is innocent, firing Mueller would be a catastrophic error.\n\nIn this critical moment, the calculus is simple: if Trump is innocent, he should avoid actions that could jeopardize his presidency. If he is guilty, there is little he can do to prevent the truth from coming to light. The choice lies with Trump: remain silent or risk making a bad situation worse.",

This arrangement, however, is not expected to last long, as both the U.K. and the EU are striving to establish their positions on a global stage dominated by the U.S. and China.\n\nThe Brexiteers advocate for 'Global Britain' as a free-market counterweight to a protectionist EU, but the division on trade and geopolitics has yet to materialize. The complexities of disentangling the relationship from the EU have proven more challenging than many anticipated, as evidenced by the end of the careers of two prime ministers, eight cabinet ministers, and over 80 MPs since the 2016 referendum.\n\nBritain must negotiate a trade deal governing future commercial relations with Europe by the end of the year or risk expensive disruption with its largest trading partner. If no agreement is reached, the possibility of a no-deal exit looms, which could lead to backlogs at ports, shortages in food and other goods, and significant economic disruption.\n\nExperts suggest that a no-deal exit could take seven years to negotiate, as demonstrated by Europe's recent trade deals with Canada and Japan. However, Prime Minister Johnson has repeatedly ruled out extending the transition date.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, two potential outcomes emerge: a narrow trade deal that governs some manufactured goods while leaving out services, the bulk of the British economy, or a no-deal exit. The latter scenario would entail costly mayhem, as companies on both sides of the English Channel stockpile goods in anticipation of customs snafus and choked ports.\n\nBrexit is not expected to mark the end of Britain's zero-sum politics. The liberal status quo, long before Britain voted to leave the EU, has entrenched asymmetries of power and inequalities of wealth. The imperative to patiently listen to the other side is not just unrealistic; it is insulting to those who persistently lose out.\n\nIn a separate matter, President Trump's declaration of airstrikes in response to attacks on American targets or assets has drawn a red line that Iran cannot cross. However, Iran relies on a network of proxy actors from Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. The question remains whether these proxy forces will respect Trump's red line, and the potential for violent conflict remains high. It is crucial that influential Republican senators remind President Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and prevent further escalation.",
    " Title: Obamacare Premiums to Increase by an Average of 22% in 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nObamacare premiums are set to increase by an average of 22% in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The most popular benchmark plans will see a significant price hike, with the number of insurers offering plans on the federally run exchange also expected to decrease.\n\nRoughly one in five customers will have only a single insurer as an option next year, following the withdrawal of major players such as UnitedHealth Group and Aetna from most states and the failure of nearly all of Obamacare's co-op plans. This situation is particularly challenging for President Obama, who is trying to boost his legacy in his final months in office, and for Hillary Clinton, his would-be Democratic successor, who has defended the law.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, stated, \"This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.\" Congressional Republicans, who are struggling to maintain their majorities in both chambers, also seized on the news, warning voters that electing Democrats would cement the Affordable Care Act into law.\n\nObamacare customers can get a first look at their own rates when they log onto the federal HealthCare.gov website during the open enrollment period, which begins on November 1. According to HHS, 80% of customers won't feel the full impact of the increases because they qualify for taxpayer-funded subsidies. Nearly three-quarters of customers in 2017 will be able to find a plan for $75 or less per month after tax credits kick in.\n\nHowever, several million customers do not qualify for government subsidies or purchase insurance off the exchanges, so they will feel the full brunt of the increases. Taxpayers will also have to shell out more money to cover the subsidies for those who do qualify, meaning Obamacare's costs will continue to rise.\n\nOn Monday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to detail the burden that taxpayers are shouldering. \"While the administration continues to focus on premium'affordability,' it ignores the undeniable fact that federal taxpayers are subsidizing these premium increases through tax credits,\" wrote Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican and the panel's chairman, along with other leading members.\n\nAnalysts for months had warned of massive premium increases, stating that the Obamacare program is still struggling to entice healthy customers who are needed to make the economics work. Increases will vary widely from place to place, though some of the figures are eye-popping: In Arizona, a 27-year-old's average monthly premium for the second-lowest silver, or \"benchmark,\" plan jumps $196 to $422, a 116% increase, before subsidies.\n\nIn Oklahoma, that same customer would get a 69% increase. Customers in Indiana and Massachusetts, which runs its own exchange, would be the only ones to see a decrease, of 3%, according to the HHS report. The administration stated that things could get worse if the federal courts do not overturn a judge's decision in May that sided with House Republicans, who say the Treasury is unlawfully reimbursing insurers for losses under the 2010 health care overhaul.\n\nDespite the headwinds, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell is predicting that the marketplace will expand by roughly 1 million customers in 2017 as insurers bring their prices in line with actual costs. She estimated that 13.8 million people will buy plans during open enrollment on the exchanges, compared with 12.7 million who initially signed up for 2016. That is still short of the 15 million that congressional scorekeepers predicted just a few months ago.\n\nEven President Obama has said his law will need changes after he is out of office, including a government-run plan, or \"public option,\" to bolster competition in the exchanges. As it stands, the number of insurers participating on HealthCare.gov has dwindled from 232 this year to 167 in 2017. HHS stated that customers on HealthCare.gov, which serves 39 states, will still be able to choose, on average, from 30 plans with different combinations of premiums, out-of-pocket costs, networks of hospitals and physicians, and prescription drug coverage options.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee's Request for Attorney General Barr's Testimony Met with Resistance, Threatening Contempt Proceedings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe refusal of Attorney General William Barr to appear before the House Judiciary Committee has led to a heightened sense among Democrats that the executive branch is in defiance of the Constitution and the rule of law, according to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md). Raskin, a former constitutional law professor who sits on both the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, stated, \"They have succeeded in building a near unanimous sense in the Democratic Caucus that the executive branch of government is in defiance of the Constitution and the rule of law.\"\n\nBarr, already under scrutiny from Democrats in both the House and Senate, declined to appear Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee because he did not want to be questioned by committee lawyers, only members. Democrats refused to accommodate Barr, citing a larger constitutional principle at stake. \"He does not dictate to us how we conduct hearings in Congress,\" Raskin said.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it clear they are not willing to cooperate with Democrats' demands. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders described Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler's request for staff lawyers to question the attorney general as a \"pathetic\" moment for the committee. \"Look, we lost confidence in Jerry Nadler a long time ago, but it's surprising to find out he's lost confidence in himself,\" Sanders said.\n\nDemocrats are now deciding on their next course of action. Nadler has stated they will make one more attempt to negotiate and obtain the unredacted Mueller report. If they do not receive it, they will hold Barr in contempt and take further legal action. On Friday, Nadler sent a letter to Barr requesting the unredacted Mueller report by May 6. If Barr does not comply, he will face contempt proceedings and further legal action.\n\nIn his letter, Nadler wrote, \"Lastly, it can not go unremarked that, in refusing to comply with congressional oversight requests, the department has repeatedly asserted that Congress's requests do not serve 'legitimate' purposes.\" He continued, \"This is not the department's judgment to make. Congress's constitutional, oversight and legislative interest in investigating misconduct by the president and his associates can not be disputed.\"\n\nSome Democrats are already calling for Barr's impeachment, including Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who is running for president. Others, including many of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, have called on him to resign. There is talk of censure, a type of public reprimand with little practical effect. Lawmakers are also researching Congress's long-dormant \"inherent contempt\" powers, which have not been triggered in nearly a century.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi (D-Calif.) reminded reporters on Thursday that ignoring Congress had consequences for another president. \"As you probably know, in the Articles of Impeachment for President Nixon, Article 3 was that he ignored the subpoenas of Congress, that he did not honor the subpoenas of Congress. This is very, very serious,\" she said.\n\nPelosi also criticized Barr for what she described as conflicting testimony to Congress about his communications with Mueller, over Barr's handling of the initial summary of the report. A March 27 letter from Mueller revealed this week called into question Barr's account. \"But what is deadly serious about it is the Attorney General of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That's a crime,\" she said.\n\nA spokesman for Barr called Pelosi's comments \"reckless, irresponsible, and false.\"\n\nNot every reaction has been as serious. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) brought a bucket of KFC to the empty hearing room on Thursday to make a theatrical point. \"Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions,\" Cohen said, perhaps sending a message to the administration about what happens when you ignore Congress. Cohen proceeded to eat the chicken in front of the cameras.\n\nIncreasingly, Democrats like Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who sits on the Judiciary panel, say they are not interested in hearing from Barr anymore. \"At this point, I do not believe anything Barr says. So I'd rather have Mueller,\" she told NPR.\n\nNadler has invited Mueller to testify on May 15. It is not yet confirmed, but Barr has said publicly that he has no objection to this. Another anticipated clash still to come involves Democrats' desire to hear from former White House Counsel Don McGahn, but President Trump is indicating that he will invoke executive privilege to block any request. \"Congress should not be looking anymore. This is all. It's done,\" Trump told Fox News on Thursday.",
    " Title: Yahoo News Confirms Katie Couric's Continued Employment Amidst Documentary Editing Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nYahoo News has confirmed that Katie Couric will continue in her role as global anchor, despite allegations of deceptive editing in documentaries she executive produced and narrated. The documentaries, \"Under the Gun\" and \"Fed Up,\" have been under scrutiny for manipulated content since their release.\n\nIn the 2016 documentary \"Under the Gun,\" Couric and director Stephanie Soechtig edited out gun rights activists' answers to a question about background checks, replacing them with several seconds of silence. This led to calls for Couric's dismissal from Yahoo News following a report by The Free Beacon that revealed the raw audio of the interview.\n\nAdditional accusations of deceptive editing were made in the 2014 documentary film \"Fed Up,\" also executive produced by Couric and directed by Soechtig. Dr. David Allison, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center, stated that his portrayal in the film was \"antithetical to the spirit of science and democratic dialogue.\" Industry sources told The Free Beacon that the documentary inserted audio at a moment it did not occur during a separate interview with Lisa Gable, a spokesperson for the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation.\n\nThe Weinstein Company, which distributes \"Fed Up,\" manually requested the removal of YouTube videos from the film following the Free Beacon report. Soechtig, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Free Beacon, defended the film in a statement to Variety, stating that it has had a significant impact on American eating habits and has inspired conversations about the issues.\n\nA spokesperson for Couric did not issue a statement to Variety but directed the publication to Soechtig's statement. Yahoo News, which was not involved in the creation and production of the independent documentaries, maintains confidence in the work of its news team, adhering to the highest standards of journalism.",
    " Title: Egypt Declares State of Emergency Following Deadly Church Bombings Claimed by ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi declared a three-month state of emergency on Sunday, following two suicide bombings at Coptic Christian churches that left at least 44 people dead and over 100 injured. The attacks, claimed by the Islamic State (ISIS) terror group, occurred at St. George Church in Tanta and St. Mark's Cathedral in Alexandria during Palm Sunday services.\n\nThe first explosion took place at St. George Church in the Nile Delta town of Tanta, where at least 27 people were killed and 78 others wounded, according to officials. Television footage showed the inside of the church, where a large number of people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers.\n\nA second explosion, which Egypt's Interior Ministry says was caused by a suicide bomber, occurred at St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, leaving at least 17 dead and 48 injured. The attack came just after Pope Tawadros II, leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, finished services, but his aides told local media that he was unharmed. At least three police officers were killed in the St. Mark's attack, the ministry told The Associated Press.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks via its Aamaq media agency, following the group's recent video vowing to step up attacks against Christians, who the group describes as \"infidels\" empowering the West against Muslims.\n\nThe blasts occurred at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi accused unnamed countries of fueling instability in the country, adding \"Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt.\" El-Sisi ordered the immediate deployment of troops to assist police in protecting vital facilities across the country.\n\nEl-Sisi did not immediately detail the legal measures needed to declare the state of emergency, but according to the Egyptian constitution, the parliament majority must vote in favor of the state of emergency.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted that he is \"so sad to hear of the terrorist attack\" against the U.S. ally but added that he has \"great confidence\" that el-Sissi, \"will handle the situation properly.\" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3.\n\nThe State Department issued its own statement condemning the attacks, which it called \"barbaric.\" \"The United States will continue to support Egypt's security and stability in its efforts to defeat terrorism,\" the statement said.\n\nThe attack in Tanta was the latest in a series of assaults on Egypt's Christian minority, which makes up around 10 percent of the population and has been repeatedly targeted by Islamic extremists.\n\nGrand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar\u2014the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam\u2014condemned the attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\"\n\nAcross the street from St. George, neighbor Susan Mikhail, whose apartment has a clear balcony view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building midmorning, at a time when the church was packed. \"Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,\" she told The Associated Press. Later, the more seriously wounded started to come out, carried in the arms of survivors and ferried to hospitals in private cars, she said.\n\nPope Francis decried the bombings, expressing \"deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.\" Word of the attacks came as Francis was holding Palm Sunday services in St. Peter's Square.\n\nBoth Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza also condemned the bombings. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted his condolences and said, \"We strongly condemn the heinous terror attacks on churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday today.\"\n\nMehmet Gormez, the head of religious affairs in Turkey, \"cursed\" the attacks and said they are the shared problem of all humanity. \"The immunity of a place of worship, no matter the religion it belongs to, can not be violated and the bloodthirsty killing of innocent worshippers can not ever be forgiven,\" Gormez said in an official statement.\n\nTurkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also published a statement denouncing the attack on St. George Church. \"We convey our condolences to the bereaved families and the whole people of Egypt,\" the statement said before a second attack hit an Alexandria church.\n\nThe bombings add to fears that Islamic extremists who have long been battling security forces in the Sinai Peninsula are shifting their focus to civilians. A local Islamic State affiliate claimed a suicide bombing at a church in Cairo in December that killed around 30 people, mostly women, as well as a string of killings in the restive Sinai Peninsula that caused hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas of the country. The group has threatened further attacks.\n\nA militant group called Liwa al-Thawra claimed responsibility for an April 1 bomb attack targeting a police training center in Tanta, which wounded 16 people. The group, believed to be linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, has mainly targeted security forces and distanced itself from attacks on Christians.",
    " Title: Trump to Decide on DACA's Future on Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump is set to announce a decision on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on Tuesday. The program, enacted by the Obama administration in June 2012, provides temporary legal status to undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump had pledged to eliminate DACA on his first day in office. However, after taking office, the president has not rescinded the program. In February, Trump confessed to reporters that the DACA situation is \"very difficult\" for him due to his affection for the young immigrants affected by the program.\n\nWhile Trump has advocated for tough enforcement of federal immigration law, he has shown sympathy towards DACA recipients, known as Dreamers. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has also argued against rescinding the program, stating that it allows some 750,000 undocumented immigrants to remain in the country legally and apply for work permits.\n\nA group of pro-enforcement state attorneys general has reportedly pressured Trump to make a decision on DACA, rather than allowing the program to continue indefinitely. In 2014, these attorneys general sued to stop the expansion of DACA and another Obama mandate, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), which provided legal status for 5 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nIf Trump rescinds DACA, those who applied for temporary legal status may feel more vulnerable, as they would have registered with the federal government. Organizations advocating for undocumented immigrants and leaders in tech and big business have joined in their concerns.\n\nThe future of DACA remains uncertain, and it is unclear what Trump's decision will entail. Some speculate that Trump may reach across the aisle and pass a measure that protects Dreamers but also bolsters enforcement, potentially by funding the border wall. However, it is important to note that any speculation regarding Trump's decision is unverified at this time.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Indicates Coronavirus Likely Occurred Naturally, but Conclusiveness Unavailable\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. intelligence suggests that the coronavirus likely originated naturally, as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China, but there is no certainty either way, according to the top U.S. general. Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made these remarks during a Pentagon news briefing on Tuesday.\n\nMilley's comments could fuel speculation about the coronavirus' origins, a topic that China has dismissed as a conspiracy theory unhelpful to the fight against the pandemic. When asked whether there was evidence that the virus began in a Chinese laboratory and was perhaps accidentally released, Milley was non-committal.\n\n\"There's a lot of rumor and speculation in a wide variety of media, the blog sites, etc. It should be no surprise to you that we've taken a keen interest in that, and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that,\" Milley said.\n\n\"And I would just say, at this point, it's inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain,\" Milley added.\n\nMilley's comments could potentially escalate tensions with Beijing, where Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian wrote on Twitter last month that the U.S. Army might have \"brought the epidemic to Wuhan.\" This claim was denounced by the U.S. government and angered U.S. President Donald Trump, who cited it when he referred to the coronavirus as \"the Chinese virus\" in briefings.\n\nAs far back as February, the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology refuted rumors that the virus may have been artificially synthesized at one of its laboratories or perhaps escaped from there.\n\nThe broad scientific consensus holds that SARS-CoV-2, the virus' official name, originated in bats. A Washington Post opinion column published on Tuesday stated that the U.S. State Department warned in diplomatic cables about safety and management weaknesses at a WIV laboratory in 2018.\n\nThe Post noted that scientists generally agreed that the virus came from animals, as opposed to being synthesized. However, it quoted one expert as saying that did not rule out that it may have emerged from the WIV laboratory, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to directly address the Washington Post column in interviews on Tuesday. \"We know this is a global pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China. We know that there were wet markets there. So we're beginning to piece the facts together,\" Pompeo said in a radio interview.\n\nA team of 27 scientists published a statement in the Lancet medical journal in February, condemning conspiracy theories, which \"do nothing but create fear, rumors, and prejudice that jeopardize our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.\" They said scientists from around the world \"overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.\"",
    " Title: Democrats' Use of Campaign Tracker Videos Raises Privacy Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic political campaigns are employing a controversial tactic by recording and publicly sharing videos of Republican congressmen and candidates' homes, sparking concerns about privacy and safety. This practice, which involves using campaign trackers to record and share raw footage of opponents' homes on the internet, has been criticized by Republicans as a gross invasion of privacy and a potential safety risk.\n\nWhile campaign tracking, which involves recording every public appearance and statement by an opponent, is a common practice in serious campaigns on both sides, Democrats are reportedly taking it a step further. They are recording video footage of the homes of GOP congressmen and candidates and posting the unedited footage online.\n\nRepublicans argue that this level of video surveillance crosses a line, particularly in terms of political standards. Wisconsin GOP Rep. Reid Ribble, who has also been followed by a cameraman while shopping for groceries, described the home videos as inappropriate and disturbing. In Ribble's case, a 38-second, soundless video of his northeastern Wisconsin home was posted online on June 18. The video, taken from a car parked outside the house, shows the large home from several different angles.\n\nRibble's wife, DeaNa, expressed her discomfort, stating that she would call the police if a tracker were to step onto their private property. Ohio Rep. Jim Renacci, who said a tracker had been hiding in the bushes to take footage of his home, echoed these concerns, stating that filming a home and posting actual addresses should be off-limits out of respect for families and neighbors.\n\nPoliticians recognize that they give up a degree of privacy when they run for office. However, the use of campaign trackers to record and share videos of opponents' homes has raised questions about when campaign tracking becomes something more like stalking. This practice has unnerved Republicans, who are already on edge after a deranged gunman shot former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords 18 months ago.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Inspector General Finds Illegal Behavior in Implementation of President Trump's Travel Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Homeland Security inspector general, John Roth, has released a memo to Congress stating that department employees illegally attempted to prevent individuals from the seven majority-Muslim countries affected by President Trump's original travel ban from boarding planes bound for the United States, despite court orders to the contrary.\n\nIn the letters to Democratic members of Congress, Mr. Roth also accused the Trump administration of using legal tactics to conceal the illegal behavior from the public. He concluded that leadership was lacking when Mr. Trump issued his original Jan. 27 travel ban, which halted all travel, including immigration and visitors, from the identified countries.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP), the Homeland Security agency responsible for screening arrivals, was left without guidance on the many questions surrounding the order, according to Mr. Roth. CBP also defied two court orders in trying to prevent passengers from boarding planes at overseas airports, issuing \"no board\" instructions to airlines even after courts had halted the travel ban policy, the report concludes.\n\nFor passengers who reached the U.S., Mr. Roth said they were treated well by CBP officers, contradicting some reports from immigrant-rights activists at the time. He said they couldn't substantiate reports of passengers being abused or children being handcuffed. In fact, he said, many CBP officers went the extra mile and provided water and food from their own personal funds.\n\nThe administration also made wide use of waivers, allowing most passengers who reached the U.S. in spite of the executive order, according to Mr. Roth. This suggests that Mr. Trump's executive order was more symbolic than enforced when it was being carried out.\n\nThe original order was blocked by a number of courts, and Mr. Trump responded with a revised order in March. That second version was also blocked by lower courts, but the Supreme Court partially overruled them in June, allowing some of the ban to take effect. Mr. Trump then updated the policy this fall, and the third version is currently under court scrutiny.\n\nMr. Roth's new memo looks at the early days after the original policy was put in place on Jan. 27, until it was fully halted by a judge in Seattle on Feb. 3. The inspector general said he submitted his findings to the Homeland Security Department on Oct. 6, but the department is still deciding whether it will classify any of the report as secret, for various reasons.\n\nDemocrats who released Mr. Roth's memo on Monday said hiding the findings is \"frankly unacceptable.\" \"The rule of law and our constitutional protections mean little if law enforcement is empowered by the president to disregard them,\" said Sens. Richard Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Illinois Democrats. \"If the Trump Administration decides to bury an inspector general report suggesting that's what happened, there will be repercussions in Congress.\"\n\nTyler Houlton, spokesman for Homeland Security, didn't respond directly to Mr. Roth's findings of illegal behavior, but insisted officers \"conducted themselves professionally, and in a legal manner.\" He also defended the attempt to shield the report's contents, saying that the ability to claim those privileges is \"well-recognized law.\"",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are D'Antonio's.\n\nAccording to D'Antonio, Trump's poor sportsmanship following his defeat in the first debate may hinder his preparation for the next one. Ignoring real poll results that show he was significantly behind, Trump has reportedly ordered his aides to cease acknowledging his loss. This denial, D'Antonio suggests, may prevent Trump from recognizing his own shortcomings.\n\nD'Antonio highlights ten areas where Trump could improve for the next debate, but notes that it is unlikely he will be able to make any of these changes. For instance, Trump has a history of avoiding taking responsibility for his actions, and D'Antonio does not expect this to change.\n\nManners, body language, and debate preparation are areas where Trump is likely to struggle, according to D'Antonio. Trump's tendency to boast and his negative body language were noted during the first debate, and D'Antonio suggests that these traits are ingrained in Trump's personality and unlikely to change.\n\nD'Antonio also points out that Trump's lack of understanding of geopolitical issues, such as his stance on Russia and the Ukraine, may continue to be a problem. Trump's penchant for personal attacks and insults is also expected to remain a feature of his campaign.\n\nAmong Trump's advisers, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is noted for his similarities with Trump. Like Trump, Giuliani poses as a tough man and has a history of personal attacks. D'Antonio suggests that Giuliani's persona may provide insight into Trump's behavior and may indicate that Trump is unlikely to change his ways.",
    " Title: Economist Bryan Caplan Argues College May Not Be Worth It for Most People\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent YouTube video, economist Bryan Caplan, author of \"The Case Against Education,\" questions the value of a college education for most people. He argues that while college tuition has significantly increased, the connection between college education and job skills is tenuous.\n\nCaplan contends that college primarily serves as a signaling device, indicating that a student was smart enough to complete their education. He suggests that the reason for the income increase associated with higher degrees is not due to the job skills acquired in college, but rather the diploma itself.\n\nCaplan argues that students spend countless hours studying subjects they may never use again, and that the time spent in school could be better utilized elsewhere. He points out that students are often bored and attend college primarily to secure a good job.\n\nCaplan argues that the high cost of college is not just a personal issue, but a national one. He compares the rising cost of college to a concert where everyone standing up blocks each other's view. In this analogy, he suggests that as more people go to college, the value of a college degree decreases.\n\nCaplan also notes that while students may learn little in college, colleges have become increasingly expensive, offering luxurious amenities such as swimming pools and gourmet dining. He suggests that these amenities are unlikely to help students secure a job.\n\nCaplan acknowledges that students studying computer science or electrical engineering may actually learn useful skills, but he questions the value of abstract topics like social justice, diversity studies, and multicultural studies. He also questions the value of liberal arts education, suggesting that it may not expand people's minds as much as teachers might claim.\n\nA study found that a third of people have not learned anything detectably after four years in college. Caplan, despite his criticism of college, acknowledges that there is one group of people who benefit from college: professors like himself. He notes that tenured professors, who cannot be fired, have a secure income and few demands on their time.\n\nCaplan is expected to teach for only five hours a week.",

The helicopter was first reported missing at approximately 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and debris was found around Okaloosa Island near Eglin Air Force Base hours later.\n\nThe search-and-rescue mission is expected to resume midday Thursday, with boats scouring the waters throughout the night Wednesday, weather permitting. Human remains have washed ashore in the area near Eglin. The cause of the accident remains unknown, with no indication of anything suspicious.\n\nThe Air Force, Coast Guard, and civilian agencies are participating in the intensive search focused on the waters east of the town of Navarre and the Navarre Bridge and near Eglin testing range site A-17. Approximately 100 people are involved in the search effort, according to Eglin spokeswoman Jasmine Porterfield.\n\nThe service members were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations. The UH-60 helicopter was not alone when it went down; a second Black Hawk safely returned to the base. The aircraft were both assigned to the Louisiana Army National Guard out of Hammond and were participating in a \"routine training mission involving the Marine Special Operations Regiment\" out of Camp Lejeune.\n\nThe Marines involved in the crash were all \"highly-trained\" members of the Marine Corps' special operations command. The Army aircrew members belonged to the Army National Guard unit out of Louisiana. The names of the service members will not be released publicly until the Coast Guard recovers their bodies or calls off the search.\n\nIn January, two Marines died when their helicopter went down at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California. Last March, an F/A-18C Hornet's pilot died after a crash about 70 miles east of Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada. This week's crash involved a UH-60 Black Hawk, a twin-engine helicopter introduced into Army service in 1979 in place of the iconic UH-1 Huey. Other branches have modified the Black Hawk for their own uses, including the Navy's SH-60 (the Sea Hawk), the Air Force's MH-60 (the Pave Hawk), and the Coast Guard's HH-60 (the Jayhawk). The Army's UH-60 helicopter has an airframe \"designed to progressively crush on impact to protect the crew and passengers.\"",
    " Title: California Defies Federal Government, Restores Net Neutrality Rules, Faces Lawsuit\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia, on Sunday, took a significant step by reinstating Obama-era net neutrality rules, defying the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Trump administration. The move comes a year after the FCC eliminated these rules. Other states, including Washington, Oregon, and Vermont, have also enacted their own net-neutrality laws, but California's approach is more assertive, prohibiting internet service providers from offering free data for specific applications.\n\nShortly after Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a statement, described the lawsuit as necessary to defend federal prerogatives and the U.S. Constitution. Sessions deemed the law \"extreme\" and \"illegal.\" The FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, who is a proponent of the Trump administration's net-neutrality agenda, also criticized the measure, labeling it as \"anti-consumer,\" \"illegal,\" \"egregious,\" and \"radical.\" Pai argued that the new law would hurt consumers by prohibiting many free-data plans.\n\nThe legality of statewide net-neutrality laws is a matter of contention. Proponents of the California law argue that the FCC has no power to interfere with state legislation, as the FCC has no authority to regulate broadband internet access providers. Barbara van Schewick, a law professor at Stanford Law School, told CNN that the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Open Internet Order removed its authority to adopt such protections, implying that the FCC cannot prevent states from adopting net-neutrality protections.\n\nThe legal action against California is set against the backdrop of the Trump administration's ongoing conflict with Silicon Valley. Last month, President Trump cited a partisan study on Twitter suggesting Google's search results were biased against him, prompting Attorney General Jeff Sessions to announce a meeting with several state attorneys general to discuss potential competition issues and the alleged suppression of free speech on tech platforms. The Department of Justice's lawsuit against California is a more tangible threat than the meeting, which experts dismissed as groundless saber-rattling at the behest of a frustrated president.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit may find support among conservatives, who have historically taken issue with California's progressive stances on various issues, such as clean energy and immigration. The lawsuit's outcome remains to be seen, but it is unlikely to be a political winner, as the majority of voters favor Obama-era net-neutrality rules.",
    " Title: Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm Criticizes Donald Trump's Rhetoric as Harmful to U.S. Democracy\n\nArticle:\n\nJennifer Granholm, the former governor and attorney general of Michigan, has criticized Donald Trump's rhetoric, stating that it is causing irreparable damage to the United States democracy. Granholm, who is currently a senior research fellow at UC Berkeley and senior advisor to Correct The Record, a super-PAC supporting Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, expressed her opinions in a commentary piece.\n\nGranholm, in her piece, expressed her desire for Trump to withdraw from the presidential race, citing his lies and vitriolic rhetoric as the reasons for her stance. She referenced a best-selling book on leadership, \"The Leadership Challenge\" by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, stating that 89% of people across the globe identify honesty as the most important characteristic of a leader.\n\nGranholm noted that despite Trump's frequent lies and offensive statements towards people of various races, creeds, and colors, he has managed to maintain a lead in the Republican presidential candidate polls for five months. She cited examples of Trump's fabrications, such as embellishing his golf course with historical events and spreading lies about a nonexistent video showing Muslims celebrating in New Jersey after the September 11 attacks.\n\nGranholm criticized Trump for his refusal to acknowledge reality and his continued repetition of his lies, even when presented with facts. She described Trump's behavior as a deliberate attempt to distort reality and portray himself as above the truth, with anyone who confronts him being perceived as an unfair attacker. The media, according to Granholm, has labeled Trump as being \"in a league of [his] own\" when it comes to making claims that contradict reality.",
    " Title: Fox News Criticizes Obama Administration for One-Year Extension of Canceled Insurance Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nFox News' program Fox & Friends, hosted by Brian Kilmeade, featured a discussion on the Obama administration's decision to allow insurance companies to extend canceled policies for an additional year. Guest C. Edmund Wright, a former health insurance agent, criticized the administration for not allowing individuals to keep their insurance policies indefinitely.\n\nWright argued that President Obama's decision to allow insurance companies to extend current plans for one year amounted to a \"one-year death sentence\" for the policies. He compared it to canceling the new Coke and only allowing consumers to have the classic Coke for a year, stating that it was an \"absurd fix.\"\n\nIn contrast, The Washington Post's Wonkblog reported that the Obama administration will allow insurance companies to renew policies that do not meet health law standards through the end of 2014. The administration's change does not force insurers to offer their products for another year, but rather encourages them to do so.\n\nMSNBC's Steven Rattner, an economic analyst and former Obama administration official, explained on MSNBC's Morning Joe that half of people on the individual market are there for less than six months, and another 30 percent are there between six and eighteen months.\n\nThe Washington Post's fact checker cited a study that measured insurance plans in California, showing that only 24 percent of people with individual coverage kept their plan for more than 48 months.\n\nIn a November 2009 letter to former Senator Evan Bayh, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) explained that because of the naturally high turnover in the individual market, few grandfathered policies would still exist by 2016.",
    " Title: Trump Issues Executive Order to Dismantle Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued his first executive order, directing federal agencies to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to the maximum extent permitted by law. The order, a political statement about the health care law, instructs agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay any taxes or penalties they can.\n\nThe executive order does not grant Trump new powers but signals his intention to swiftly dismantle significant parts of the health care overhaul. Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, explains, \"This order does not in and of itself do anything tangible, but it directs federal agencies to start taking steps to use their administrative authority to unwind the ACA in all sorts of ways. This is a signal that the Trump administration is not waiting for Congress to start making big changes.\"\n\nThe order's directive to dismantle provisions imposing fiscal burdens on states or individuals is seen as a potential target for the individual mandate, a contentious aspect of the ACA. The mandate requires all Americans to have health care coverage, and its implementation is crucial for the law's overall functioning.\n\nWhile Trump could potentially stop enforcing the individual mandate without Congress, this executive action alone does not unravel the mandate or any other part of Obamacare. Instead, it initiates a lengthy process to change the law's rules, which takes time. Tim Jost, a health law expert and law professor at Washington and Lee College, notes, \"Trump is going to have to comply with the law, and that doesn't allow him to repeal the Affordable Care Act unilaterally.\"\n\nThe executive order contains two crucial elements, according to Jost. First, most paragraphs in the order start with the phrase \"to the maximum extent permitted by law,\" acknowledging that federal agencies can only take actions that do not conflict with the ACA. Second, Trump has pledged to follow the Administrative Procedure Act for new rules, a law that governs the rulemaking process, which involves drafting rules, accepting comments, holding public hearings, and ultimately issuing final rules.\n\nIn summary, Trump's executive order is a political statement signaling his intention to dismantle the ACA, but it does not have immediate tangible effects. The order sets in motion a lengthy process to change the law's rules, which will require compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and Congressional action.",
    " Title: Baucus Expected to be Nominated as U.S. Ambassador to China, Leaving Senate Seat Open\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Max Baucus, a long-serving Montana Democrat, is expected to be nominated by the White House to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to China, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Baucus began informing some of his colleagues and his staff about his upcoming nomination on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe exact timing of the appointment is unclear, but Baucus would need to be confirmed by his Senate colleagues if he leaves before his term ends. If he departs early, Baucus will relinquish his position as chair of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, where he has been aggressively pushing for a dramatic rewrite of the Tax Code.\n\nBaucus's departure could significantly impact the 2014 Senate landscape, as he is the third longest-serving senator and seniority is highly valued in the institution. His departure could also open up a competitive Senate seat in Montana, where Democratic Governor Steve Bullock appoints the senator when there is a vacancy.\n\nLt. Governor John Walsh, a Democrat, is already running for the open seat against Rep. Steve Daines, a Republican. If Walsh is appointed by Bullock, he would run as an incumbent, giving him an advantage in a hotly-contested race.\n\nBaucus's nomination had been rumored in congressional circles for the last month. The White House has not yet responded to a request for comment, and Baucus's spokesman declined to comment. However, the president and Baucus maintain friendly relations, with Baucus's long-time former staffer and close personal friend, Jim Messina, serving as Obama's campaign manager in his 2012 reelection effort.\n\nBaucus's departure would open up a key position on the Senate Finance Committee, one of the most powerful positions in Congress given its sweeping authority over tax and health care programs. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the liberal West Virginia Democrat, is next in line to chair the panel. Rockefeller has been coy about his intentions for the Finance Committee gavel.\n\nBaucus has served on the Senate Finance Committee since 1979, making him the longest-serving senator on the committee in history. He has been an ally and adversary to presidents in both parties, and his departure will leave a significant void in the Senate.\n\nBaucus's confirmation process will be handled by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which quickly approved another senator to a diplomatic post earlier this year. The specifics of Baucus's role in China, including his approach to rising tensions with Japan, China's growing economic might, and diplomatic issues involving North Korea and other regional hotspots, remain to be seen.",
    " Title: Former CIA Director John Brennan Described as \"Nonpartisan\" Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Brennan, former CIA director under the Obama administration, has described himself on his Twitter account as \"Nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future.\" However, this description has been challenged as inaccurate, with some arguing that Brennan's political leanings and past actions make him a highly partisan figure.\n\nBrennan's ascent to the CIA director position began with a lie-detector test in which he admitted to being a supporter of the Soviet-controlled American Communist party. During the 2016 election, he was accused of playing a role in setting in motion a sham investigation into the Trump campaign. Recently, NBC signed Brennan up as a \"national security\" correspondent, sparking criticism for giving a platform to a figure with a vested interest in the outcome of the investigation.\n\nCongress is currently investigating Brennan for possible perjury, and his role in the Steele dossier has been a subject of controversy. NBC's decision to hire Brennan as a correspondent has been criticized, with some questioning the media's use of figures with a vested interest in the outcome of a story.\n\nLast week, Jonathan Winer, a former State Department official, outed himself as a cog in the Obamagate scandal. He played a role in briefing John Kerry and other officials on the Hillary-financed Steele dossier during the campaign, and later passed material from Cody Shearer, another dirt-diver for Hillary, to Steele, who then gave it to the FBI.\n\nWiner, who once tried to write a film treatment for Oliver Stone, works hard to affect a nonchalance about his role in the scandal, casting his friendship with Steele and Sidney Blumenthal in a nonpartisan light. Winer plays dumb about Shearer, calling him a \"journalist\" whose work he \"did not know.\" However, once apprised of Shearer's notes by Blumenthal, Winer decided to share them with Steele to get his \"professional reaction.\"\n\nSusan Rice, who is also under scrutiny for her role in the scandal, recently made headlines for an \"I am not guilty\" note she emailed herself on her last day in office. In the note, Rice wrote about a conversation with President Obama in which he stressed that the intelligence and law enforcement communities should handle the issue \"by the book.\" This statement has been criticized as a galling propagandistic high-wire act, with some questioning the normalcy of political espionage.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Brennan, Winer, and Rice is part of a larger debate about the role of politics in intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and the use of government power to influence elections. The debate has sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability in government, and has led to questions about the motivations and actions of those who rose to the top of the ruling class during the Obama administration.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes New Sanctions on Russia, Sparking Threats of Retaliation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has announced a new round of sanctions against Russia in response to the nerve-agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the U.K. The sanctions have caused the Russian ruble to slide, with the currency reaching its lowest levels since 2016, though it later recovered some of its drop.\n\nThe U.S. administration is under pressure to take tougher steps against Russia, even as President Donald Trump has called for closer ties. The new sanctions are required under the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, which mandates punishment of countries that use chemical weapons in violation of international law.\n\nThe initial round of these sanctions will limit exports to Russia of U.S. goods and technology considered sensitive on national security grounds, including electronics, lasers, and some specialized oil and gas production technologies. Waivers will be allowed for space-flight activities and U.S. foreign assistance.\n\nRussia's response was defiant but stopped short of specific measures pending more details on the U.S. plans. Officials said Russia may respond by imposing restrictions on trade with the U.S. under a law passed earlier this year in response to an earlier wave of penalties. That could include cutting off supplies of rocket engines needed for U.S. space launches, one official said, as well as aviation.\n\nThe additional sanctions could include a downgrading in diplomatic relations, blanket bans on the import of Russian oil and exports of \"all other goods and technology\" aside from agricultural products, as well as limits on loans from U.S. banks. The U.S. also would have to suspend aviation agreements and oppose any multilateral development bank assistance.\n\nThe added sanctions could be averted if President Trump declared that waiving them would be in the U.S. national interest, a politically risky move in light of criticism that he\u2019s been too soft on Russia on issues including interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Russia has repeatedly denied having chemical or biological weapons and held out little hope for compromise.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Escalation of Tariffs on Chinese Goods, Stalemate in U.S.-China Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump has declared his intention to escalate tariffs on Chinese goods, with the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in products set to be followed by levies on an additional $16 billion. The President has also threatened Beijing with potential tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nAt present, the resolution of this trade war remains uncertain, with both parties seemingly at an impasse. China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S., and without scheduled official talks between the two countries, a swift resolution appears unlikely.\n\nEdward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, stated, \"At the moment, I don't see how this ends. This is very much in the president's hands because he's got advisers that seem divided, some substantively, some tactically. I just don't think we've had any clear signs of the resolution he wants.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is engaging in trade wars on multiple fronts, imposing tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines from countries including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, and Japan. However, the tariffs on China, the world's largest manufacturing hub, affect a larger share of products and a greater percentage of companies that rely on global supply chains, potentially causing more harm to American companies than the Chinese firms the Trump administration is targeting.\n\nThe President's aggressive approach toward China is intended to pressure the country to curtail what the White House describes as a pattern of unfair trade practices and theft of American intellectual property. In addition to the tariffs, the White House is imposing restrictions on investment and on visas for Chinese nationals. The administration claims these trade barriers are being used as leverage to force Beijing to make changes, including opening its markets to American companies and ending its practice of requiring firms operating in China to hand over valuable technology.",
    " Title: Assessment of Policy Proposals in the Democratic Primary: A Closer Look at Clinton and Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary, the contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is often framed by Clinton's supporters as a choice between an unrealistic radical with impractical proposals and a pragmatic political veteran with more achievable proposals. However, this framing raises two significant points of contention.\n\nFirst, there is little evidence to suggest that less-ambitious proposals will consistently deliver better results. Second, in crucial areas, Clinton has not proposed any concrete solutions at all.\n\nNotable economist and liberal pundit Paul Krugman, a proponent of Clinton, has presented two arguments in response to Sanders supporters who emphasize the value of far-reaching goals for political organizing and as a starting point for negotiations.\n\nThe second argument, which we will examine first, suggests that Sanders' single-payer healthcare proposal is unrealistic and would be sold with misleading cost estimates due to its supposed impossibility and the media's alleged bias against social insurance. However, a left-leaning think tank's analysis of Sanders' plan indicates that everyone outside of the top 1% would experience a net positive income, with increased taxation more than offset by the elimination of insurance premiums.\n\nRegarding the argument that Clinton's proposals are more realistic, there is a lack of clarity on how this would significantly improve American healthcare. Clinton's health care section on her issues page does not offer a plan to address the underinsurance problem in ObamaCare or provide insurance to the approximately 30 million uninsured individuals.\n\nFurthermore, on the critical issue of monetary policy, Krugman, who has consistently argued that the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates last December was a mistake, has not mentioned this point in his critique of Sanders. Sanders is the only candidate from either party who agrees with Krugman on this issue, while Clinton's economy page does not even mention monetary policy.\n\nPolitical campaigns, according to Steve Randy Waldman, serve to advance moral values and set priorities. While experienced policy people are essential for crafting legislative bills, the majority of people vote for candidates who align with their values and trust them to handle the complexities of policy.\n\nIn conclusion, while individuals are free to support whichever candidate they choose, it is important to acknowledge that there is no clear-cut policy case for Hillary Clinton, as her policy book appears to be missing some crucial pages.",
    " Title: North Korean Leader's Letter to Trump May Indicate Divergent Views on Denuclearization\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly written a letter to President Donald Trump, expressing his desire to meet with the U.S. President, according to an unnamed foreign official who spoke to the Wall Street Journal on Friday. The letter was hand-delivered to Trump by Kim Yong Chol, a top North Korean official, at the White House on Friday afternoon.\n\nTrump announced that he would meet with Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore, but he has yet to read the letter, stating that he could be in \"for a big surprise\" once he looks at it. However, the content of the letter suggests that Kim Jong Un does not express a desire for his country to make any concessions regarding denuclearization, despite not threatening the U.S. in any way.\n\nThe Trump administration has been advocating for North Korea to agree to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization (CVID) quickly, which would require Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program swiftly. However, North Korea reportedly prefers a phased approach, in which both Washington and Pyongyang make concessions over a long period of time. This could mean North Korea allows inspectors to view its nuclear sites in exchange for the U.S. diplomatically recognizing the Kim regime.\n\nThe divergent views on denuclearization could potentially foreshadow a bigger problem later on. Some experts believe that the summit might address these concerns and help narrow the gap between the two sides. Joseph Yun, a US Institute of Peace expert and former top North Korea negotiator in the Trump administration, stated that the meeting could lead to a \"meaningful dialogue towards an eventual resolution.\"\n\nTrump is planning to spend the weekend at Camp David discussing the U.S. agenda for the possible summit. However, it remains unclear what, exactly, he will do after reading the North Korean leader's note.",
    " Title: Giuliani Denies McGahn Flipping, Accuses Mueller Team of Leaking Information\n\nArticle:\n\nTrump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani refuted speculation on Sunday that White House counsel Donald McGahn had cooperated with the special counsel in an attempt to implicate President Trump, accusing investigators of leaking information about McGahn's cooperation with the special counsel in order to lure the president into a perjury trap.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Giuliani stated, \"They're down to desperation time. They have to write a report, and they don't have a single bit of evidence.\"\n\nThe New York Times, citing multiple unidentified sources, reported Saturday that McGahn had spent 30 hours over three days answering questions as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference. The report fueled comparisons to Nixon White House counsel John Dean's decision to switch sides during the Watergate investigation.\n\nHowever, former Trump attorney John Dowd dismissed such comparisons, stating, \"Pure fiction on claims of pushback by McGahn,\" and describing him as a \"terrific witness\" for the president. Dowd also defended the Trump administration's open-book legal strategy of providing extensive access to witnesses and documents.\n\nMcGahn's attorney, William A. Burck, released a statement confirming that his client had cooperated fully. In the statement, Burck said, \"President Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn's testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team's questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must.\"\n\nGiuliani accused the special counsel's office of leaking the report to spur Trump into testifying and setting him up for a perjury charge by having him contradict statements by former FBI Director James B. Comey about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn a statement, the New York Times communications department said the newspaper \"stands behind the reporting of our Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters.\" This article is based on information from multiple sources, as stated in the original text. However, the sources remain unidentified, and their identities are not available in the provided text.\n\nGiuliani also accused the special counsel's team of panicking because \"they know they don't have a case, there was no collusion, there was no obstruction, they can't prove it, and they are trying to get the president to testify.\" He added that the president has turned over 1.4 million documents, encouraged more than 30 witnesses, including McGahn, to testify, and declined to assert executive privilege as part of his commitment to transparency.\n\nThe article concludes with Giuliani's statement that the president's decision to decline to assert executive and attorney-client privilege has come into question, but Dowd stated, \"It was smarter to be transparent and get the case over with.\" Dowd also noted that the alternative was a \"nightmare, just a war.\"",
    " Title: Sanders Emerges as Front-Runner in Democratic Presidential Race, Offering New Direction for America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Nevada caucuses, Bernie Sanders has taken the lead in the Democratic presidential race. While former Vice President Joe Biden is favored in the upcoming South Carolina primary, bolstered by his support among African American voters, Sanders has gained momentum following his wins in the first three contests.\n\nIn Nevada, Sanders demonstrated the breadth of his growing coalition, leading the field among men and women, whites and Latinos, union households and non-union households, voters of all ages except those over 65, Democrats who identified as liberals, moderates, and conservatives.\n\nSanders, along with Elizabeth Warren, has presented Americans with a new direction, advocating for a modern version of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Economic Bill of Rights. This includes proposals such as Medicare for all, tuition-free public education, universal day care, and a Green New Deal to address climate change while generating jobs. Both candidates plan to fund these initiatives by taxing the wealthy and corporations to invest in public goods.\n\nOther candidates, including Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and Mike Bloomberg, have criticized these ideas as too radical, bold, costly, and ambitious. They offer a continuation of politics as they were before Donald Trump's presidency. However, the problem with this approach, as the article points out, is that it does not offer much hope for most Americans.\n\nSanders identifies as a \"democratic socialist,\" while Warren prefers the label \"making markets work.\" Yet, their agendas are substantially similar, with the key difference being in labels, not substance.\n\nThe term \"democratic socialism\" has already become a topic of debate, with some fearmongering and red-baiting. Critics, such as Trump and Mike Bloomberg, have portrayed Sanders' and Warren's views on wealth taxation as communist. As Sanders continues to gain momentum or if Warren gains traction, voters can expect to hear more of these arguments.\n\nHowever, it is essential to remember that the important word in \"democratic socialism\" is democratic, not socialist. Sanders is not advocating for making America into Cuba or Venezuela; instead, he is proposing extending social guarantees like those offered in most other advanced industrial states, such as Denmark and Sweden. These countries have universal health care at lower cost, paid family leave, guaranteed paid vacations, higher minimum wages, more generous public retirement programs, vibrant and competitive economies, lower inequality, less poverty, and higher life expectancies.\n\nSanders is seeking a popular mandate from voters to move in this direction. When considering democratic socialism, it is crucial to remember programs that Republicans and conservatives, as well as corporate lobbies, denounced as socialistic when they were first introduced, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, environmental and consumer protection, banking regulation to protect consumers.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which manages civil aviation and international waters, is a state program. The Food and Drug Administration, which ensures drug safety, is a state program. The minimum wage, food stamps, public housing could all be considered democratic socialist programs.\n\nOur problem has been that we have too much socialism for the rich and the powerful\u2014subsidies for corporations, get-out-of-jail-free cards for crooked bankers, tax breaks for the rich that leave them paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries, monopoly power for corporations that allows them to gouge customers\u2014and too little shared security\u2014democratic socialism\u2014for working people: affordable health care, a living wage, guaranteed paid vacation and family leave, universal childcare, affordable college, public mobilization to deal with the threat of climate change.\n\nWhen I ran for the presidency, I did not use the label, although some tried to slur me as a socialist or a communist. However, the label does not make a difference. The question is one of direction, not name-calling; of program, not posturing.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, often smeared as a \"red\" or a communist, was clear on this matter. In 1966, he confided to his staff:\n\n\"You can't talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of the slums. You're really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\"\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to set aside the fearmongering and the red-baiting and focus instead on the substance. There is no question we need big structural change, as Elizabeth Warren puts it. We need a better distribution of wealth and a greater protection of basic human rights like the right to affordable health care, as Sanders argues.\n\nCall it capitalism with a conscience, democratic socialism, or lemonade. It's the substance, not the label, that counts.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Vows Legal Action to Secure Testimony of Former White House Counsel Don McGahn\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could escalate into another high-profile battle, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, has vowed to pursue legal action to secure the testimony of former White House Counsel Don McGahn. This decision comes after McGahn defied a subpoena and skipped a committee hearing at President Trump's direction.\n\nAccording to Nadler, Trump's actions amount to witness intimidation. \"When this committee issues a subpoena, even to a senior presidential adviser, the witness must show up. Our subpoenas are not optional,\" Nadler stated at the hearing that McGahn did not attend.\n\nOn Monday, Nadler hinted at the possibility of contempt charges, stating, \"I can not emphasize this enough \u2014 the chairman\u2019s track record demonstrates he does not actually want information, he wants the fight, but not the truth.\"\n\nThe president directed McGahn not to appear for the committee hearing, citing a Justice Department opinion that he cannot be compelled to testify about his official duties. In a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders described the subpoena for McGahn as part of Democrats' continued pursuit of Trump investigations.\n\nThe related Department of Justice memo asserts that McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has \"immunity\" from being compelled to testify about his official duties. The committee announced the hearing last week, but it was initially unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.\n\nThe House committee's subpoena, issued amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation. The battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.\n\nEarlier this month, the committee voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller\u2019s full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation. Trump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.",
    " Title: Mental Health Evaluation of Vester Flanagan: A Look at Delusional Thinking and Its Potential Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe shooting incident at WDBJ7 in Virginia, which resulted in the death of a journalist and cameraman, has brought to light the complex and often unpredictable nature of human behavior. Vester Flanagan, the shooter, reportedly showed signs of being an angry, disgruntled individual or a psychotic individual with delusional beliefs.\n\nIn a reflection on his professional experience as a psychiatrist, the author discusses the evaluation of individuals with paranoia, a type of psychotic delusion, that focuses on perceived threats from the government or individuals. It is unclear whether Flanagan's actions were driven by a personal grudge, narcissism, or delusional thinking.\n\nThe author recounts a case from his past where a patient believed his friend was secretly undermining his successful corporation. The seemingly innocuous question about the friend's Chinese investors was interpreted as evidence of a plot against him. This illustrates how delusional, psychotic thinking can distort and exaggerate seemingly innocuous events or statements.\n\nThe author concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and addressing delusional thinking in individuals who exhibit extreme and irrational behavior. Employers or family members should consider whether such behavior is a manifestation of irritability or a reflection of a deeper, intractable, delusional perspective on the people in their lives and the events around them.\n\nAt the time of writing, it remains unclear whether anyone in Flanagan's life was able to make this determination before the tragic incident occurred. The author's account serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of delusional thinking and the importance of early intervention and support for individuals exhibiting such behaviors.",
    " Title: Is Washington's Political Gridlock a Myth? Scholar Argues U.S. Policymakers Perform Better Than Expected\n\nArticle:\n\nA senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Pietro Nivola, has argued that the ongoing criticism of Washington's political system as dysfunctional may be misguided. In a recent analysis, Nivola suggests that, when measured against the challenge of recovering from the Great Recession, U.S. politicians have performed better than their counterparts in other advanced democracies.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, Congress has passed significant legislation, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the rescue of the domestic auto industry, the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, and an enormous stimulus bill. Nivola describes Congress's inability to pass more recent budget and tax measures as a \"useful stasis,\" meaning that had the House and Senate agreed on a course of action, the ideas might have done more harm.\n\nHowever, Nivola acknowledges concerns about how Congress will respond to the fiscal challenges it faces after the November election. The combination of a fresh expiration date for the Bush tax cuts and a spate of automatic spending cuts could lead to what is variously being described as \"the fiscal cliff\" and \"taxmaggedon.\"\n\nBill Connelly, a political scientist at Washington and Lee University in Virginia and author of the book \"James Madison Rules America,\" suggests that Congress's partisan brinkmanship is a feature, not a bug, in the American system of checks and balances. Connelly argues that Congress's last-minute deal-making is a long-standing tradition, comparing it to college students who do their work at the last minute when deadlines are looming.\n\nNot everyone shares this optimistic view. Even when Washington does manage to find a resolution, the process of legislative sausage-making has become so open and ugly that some worry bad congressional habits and bipartisan disagreements have become problems in and of themselves. Just last month, the governor of \"the other Washington,\" Democrat Christine Gregoire, complained that Congress's last-minute deal in August to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a government shutdown had almost instantly cost Washington state $1.4 billion in projected economic growth, as consumer confidence took a hit.\n\nSarah Binder, a colleague of Nivola's at Brookings and a Congress watcher at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., notes that even if the president and Congress do reach an agreement, that may not be good enough. \"There's a cost to that type of legislating,\" Binder says. \"Even if at the end of the day we stare at the abyss and reach agreement, that's probably not good enough.\"",
    " Title: Top 10 Delusional Moments in the 2012 Presidential Campaign Revealed by Campaign Strategists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a candid gathering at Harvard University, top strategists from the 2012 presidential campaigns discussed their regrets and mistakes during the eight-hour event. The conference, sponsored by the Institute of Politics since 1972, featured representatives from all GOP primary campaigns and the president's team.\n\nHere are the top 10 delusional moments of the 2012 election, as told by those who lived it:\n\n1. Romney strategist Stuart Stevens defended the much-mocked TV ad the Romney campaign ran in the closing weeks of its Ohio campaign, which claimed that President Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who were going to build Jeeps in China. The ad was widely criticized as misleading, and Chrysler quickly issued a statement denying the claim.\n\n2. Romney's strategists believed that having Clint Eastwood speak at the GOP convention in Tampa would draw a larger viewing audience. However, Eastwood's antics, including speaking to an empty chair, ended up becoming the story of the night, upstaging Romney's convention address.\n\n3. Romney's campaign team believed that Rick Perry's back problems would not significantly impact his performance in the debates. However, Perry's back pain was evident during the debates, and his performance was widely criticized.\n\n4. The Romney campaign believed that the \"47%\" video, in which Romney privately expressed his disdain for 47% of the American people, would not have a significant impact on the election. However, the video was leaked to the media, and it was widely criticized as revealing Romney's true feelings about the electorate.\n\n5. The Romney campaign believed that the \"binders full of women\" comment, in which Romney discussed his efforts to hire women during his time as governor of Massachusetts, would not be a significant issue. However, the comment was widely criticized as insensitive and tone-deaf.\n\n6. The Romney campaign believed that the \"horses and bayonets\" comment, in which Romney criticized President Obama's military strategy, would not be a significant issue. However, the comment was widely criticized as showing a lack of understanding of military affairs.\n\n7. The Romney campaign believed that the \"self-deportation\" policy, in which Romney suggested that undocumented immigrants would self-deport if certain conditions were met, would be a viable solution to the immigration issue. However, the policy was widely criticized as inhumane and unrealistic.\n\n8. The Romney campaign believed that the \"Big Bird\" comment, in which Romney suggested cutting funding for public broadcasting, would not be a significant issue. However, the comment was widely criticized as showing a lack of understanding of the importance of public broadcasting.\n\n9. The Romney campaign believed that the \"binders full of women\" comment, in which Romney discussed his efforts to hire women during his time as governor of Massachusetts, would not be a significant issue. However, the comment was widely criticized as insensitive and tone-deaf.\n\n10. The Romney campaign believed that the \"you didn't build that\" comment, in which President Obama was criticized for suggesting that businesses did not succeed on their own, would not be a significant issue. However, the comment was widely criticized as showing a lack of understanding of the role of government in the economy.\n\nThe conference offered insights into how a campaign can delude itself in an attempt to win the presidency. The GOP strategists were candid about their mistakes and regrets, while the Obama strategists shot back with their own perspectives on the impact of the GOP's decisions.",
    " Title: U.S., Other Countries Implement Export Bans on Protective Equipment and Hydroxychloroquine\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent weeks, several countries, including the United States, Turkey, Ukraine, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Africa, Ecuador, France, Germany, and India, have imposed export bans on protective masks and related equipment to secure their domestic supplies amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration invoked a Korean War-era law to restrict exports of U.S.-made protective masks, directing American companies producing such items overseas to prioritize domestic markets. One American company, 3M, stated that halting planned overseas shipments could endanger health workers in Canada and Latin America. On Monday, 3M announced a compromise with the government, agreeing to send some masks to the U.S. and some overseas.\n\nIndia, the world's largest producer of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug being tested for potential benefits against the virus, has also banned exports of the drug, allowing limited shipments under specific circumstances. Britain has prohibited exports of hydroxychloroquine, while Hungary has banned exports of the raw material for the drug and medicines containing it.\n\nMariangela Simao, assistant director-general for medicines and health products at the World Health Organization in Geneva, stated, \"The export bans are not helpful. They can disrupt supply chains of some products that are actually needed everywhere.\"\n\nPresident Trump has been vocal in securing an American stockpile of hydroxychloroquine, disregarding the advice of federal scientists who have warned that testing remains minimal, with limited evidence of benefits.\n\nSatish Kumar, an adjunct professor at the International Institute of Health Management Research in New Delhi, commented, \"In this situation, each country has to take care of itself. If we are not able to take care of our population, it will be a very critical situation.\"",
    " Title: Study Suggests Protests May Have Slowed COVID-19 Spread in Cities with Large Demonstrations\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by a nationwide research team, including a University of Colorado Denver professor, has found that protests against racism and police violence may have slowed the overall spread of the coronavirus in cities with large demonstrations, including Denver.\n\nThe study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, used official coronavirus case counts and anonymous, aggregated cell phone data to analyze the impact of protests on the overall transmission of the virus within the entire community. The team found that protests correlated with a net increase in overall stay-at-home behavior in cities where they occurred, and the increase was larger in cities that saw more sustained protests or reports of violence.\n\nThe study looked at 315 American cities with populations of over 100,000 and found that 281 of those cities saw protests. The remaining 34 cities, which included Aurora at the time, were used as a control group against which to measure the impact of the protests. The researchers found that protests correlated with a net increase in overall stay-at-home behavior in cities where they occurred, and the increase was larger in cities that saw more sustained protests or reports of violence.\n\nThe study also found that, with greater social distancing, COVID case growth slowed in cities with protests from what would be expected, but not by a statistically significant amount. The authors note that there may be other explanations for the trends. Overall, though, they say the data show that any resurgence in coronavirus cases can't be pinned entirely on the protests.\n\n\"Public speech and public health did not trade off against each other in this case,\" the authors wrote in the paper.\n\nThe study's findings come as officials in Colorado and other states are concerned about rising infections, especially among young people. New infections among young people have contributed significantly to Colorado's uptick in cases in recent days, reversing a weeks-long trend of falling case numbers and putting Colorado back onto the list of potential coronavirus problem spots. Meanwhile, the number of new infections among older Coloradans has dropped.\n\nWith the July 4 holiday approaching, Gov. Jared Polis and county health officials have pleaded with people to be responsible and avoid large gatherings. \"We don't have the direct causation of this uptick,\" Polis told reporters last week, noting that there is evidence that some young people who are part of an outbreak in Boulder had attended protests while other outbreaks are tied to social gatherings. \"And we hope this is a trend that is reversed in our state.\"\n\nOn Monday, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said that, while the state has now seen rising numbers of new cases for two consecutive weeks, \"we have not seen any clear association between the protests and an increase in cases.\" The spokesman, Ian Dickson, said the uptick in infections \"may be partly due to some Coloradans changing their behavior \u2014 especially socializing in larger groups, sometimes without proper distancing or mask wearing.\"\n\nThe study's authors note that their research does not attempt to figure out whether the protests spread the virus among the people at the protest. Instead, they say the research took the bigger-picture view: What did the protests mean for overall transmission of the virus within the entire community?\n\n\"An outdoor wedding doesn't generate avoidance behavior; we're measuring avoidance behavior,\" said Andrew Friedson, the CU-Denver professor who is one of the paper's co-authors. \"People don't say, 'Oh man, there's an outdoor wedding next door, we should stay home.'\"\n\nThe study's findings do not provide a green light for governments to fully reopen bars, concert venues, and other places where people gather in large numbers. The key to the researcher's conclusions is that the protests, while receiving lots of support, were ultimately things most people decided to avoid. That's not true of many other large gatherings.",
    " Title: Facebook Announces Redesign of Privacy Controls Amidst Data Privacy Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nSocial media giant Facebook has announced an overhaul of its privacy controls, aiming to make them more accessible and user-friendly. However, the changes do not alter Facebook's existing privacy policies or the types of data it collects from its users.\n\nThe redesign will be implemented in the coming weeks, according to a post on Facebook's blog. Notable changes include a consolidation of privacy settings for mobile devices, which will appear on a single screen instead of being spread across 20 different ones. Additionally, Facebook is introducing a new Privacy Shortcuts menu to simplify the process of finding privacy, security, and advertising information.\n\nFacebook's history is marked by repeated promises of privacy updates, only to reiterate these efforts in response to subsequent controversies. In 2008, Facebook pledged to introduce \"privacy updates that give users more control.\" This language was almost repeated two years later, when Facebook announced an update would introduce \"more powerful controls.\" In the latest statement, Facebook vowed to \"put people more in control of their privacy.\"\n\nJessi Hempel, a senior writer at Wired, told CBSN, \"Facebook is saying, 'I've made things easier for you, but I've also revealed to you how hard it was' to control your privacy. Facebook had a trust problem before this. This turns a problem into a crisis.\"\n\nThe privacy update may not necessarily alleviate consumer doubts, according to Josh Feldmeth, senior partner at marketing consultancy Prophet. \"Facebook is saying, 'I've made things easier for you, but I've also revealed to you how hard it was' to control your privacy. Facebook had a trust problem before this. This turns a problem into a crisis.\"\n\nThe announcement follows growing criticism of Facebook's data-privacy policies in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the harvesting of data from as many as 50 million Facebook users for political messaging purposes. It remains unclear whether the changes will persuade users who have deleted their Facebook accounts to rejoin the service, or whether they will appease lawmakers and privacy advocates who have expressed concerns about Facebook's collection and use of personal data.\n\nFacebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan and deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer stated, \"We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find. In the coming weeks, we'll be proposing updates to Facebook's terms of service that include our commitments to people.\"",
    " Title: Multiple People Injured in Shooting Incident Near New Orleans' French Quarter\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting rampage in the early hours of Sunday near the French Quarter of New Orleans left ten individuals wounded, with revelers from an annual football game scrambling for cover and police in pursuit of at least one suspect. The incident occurred on Canal Street near Bourbon Street, an area known for its tourist population and police presence, even at 3:20 a.m.\n\nNew Orleans Police Department Superintendent Shaun Ferguson stated that the shooting erupted in this area due to the annual Bayou Classic football game between Grambling State University and Southern University, which had been played the previous day. The game historically attracts a large crowd to the city.\n\nTwo of the injured individuals were hospitalized in critical condition, and no officers were among the wounded, according to Ferguson. One person was detained near the scene, but Ferguson did not yet know if this individual played a role in the shooting. No arrests had been made as of Sunday.\n\nFerguson described the incident as a \"cowardly and senseless act\" that the city will not tolerate. He emphasized that the investigation is in its early stages, but they will not rest until they identify and apprehend those responsible.\n\nInitially, police reported ten people were wounded, later raised the number to eleven, and then dropped it back to ten. Few other details were released, but Ferguson stated that officers thought they were being fired upon and were within feet of the incident, yet unable to determine who was firing the shots due to the large crowd.\n\nThe motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Ferguson did not have names, genders, or ages for the wounded individuals. Police are interviewing witnesses and searching for surveillance and other video that might provide insight into the case.\n\nFerguson urged the public to leave their guns at home, and he noted that violent crime in the city has been declining for four years. State police and federal authorities are aiding the investigation.\n\nKenneth Culbreth, a witness, told nola.com he was heading to the Canal Street CVS to make a quick purchase when he heard gunshots. \"I heard pops. It was so many, I couldn\u2019t keep count,\" he said.\n\nMayor LaToya Cantrell described the shootings as an \"ugly disruption\" to an otherwise beautiful weekend in the city of 400,000 people. She and Ferguson noted that the city has made significant progress in reducing violent crime over the past four years.\n\n\"The city of New Orleans will not allow incidents like this to derail the progress we have made or to further disrupt our community,\" Cantrell said. \"This tragedy will not define us, and it will not deter us from moving our city forward and keeping our people safe.\"",
    " Title: Trump Discusses Separation from Business Empire, Emoluments Clause Debated\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump stated on Wednesday that distancing himself from his business empire is a routine matter and not as complex as the media portrays it to be. He also mentioned that the American public was aware of the scale of his business ventures before the election.\n\n\"That's very routine, honestly - it's a very routine thing,\" Trump told reporters. \"It's not a big deal. You people are making that a big deal, the business.\"\n\nTrump had initially planned to hold a press conference on December 15 to discuss his plans for separating himself from his hotel and golf course empire before his inauguration. However, he postponed this conference. He indicated that he would hold a press conference in early January instead.\n\n\"It's a much bigger business than anybody thought. It's a great business, but I'm going to have nothing to do with it,\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"I don't have to because, as you know, I wouldn't have to do that by law, but I want to do that because I want to focus on the country.\"\n\nTrump further explained that he ran for office with the public knowing about his extensive business interests. \"I don't have to do it [step away from the business] by law, but I want to do that because I want to focus on the country,\" he said.\n\nScholars are currently debating whether the Emoluments Clause in the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments, would still pose issues for Trump even if he separates himself from his business. This debate arises due to Trump's announced plans to hand control of his businesses to his adult sons.\n\nTrump was accompanied by legendary boxing promoter Don King during the press briefing. He is holding meetings this week at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.",
    " Title: Republicans Launch Oversight Hearings on Obamacare Website Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is facing scrutiny from Republicans, particularly in relation to the problems encountered during the rollout of the health care exchanges' enrollment website. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Chairman Fred Upton (R-Michigan), has scheduled a hearing for next Thursday to address these issues.\n\nUpton has requested officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to brief his committee on the problems with the website, as well as to provide records of their communications with website contractors regarding the site's launch and the issues users have faced.\n\nIn addition, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by Chairman Darrell Issa, has demanded information about the rollout problems from Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. This request was joined by Sen. Lamar Alexander, the ranking Republican on the Senate committee on health, education, labor, and pensions.\n\nOne issue that has arisen is the ability to log in to healthcare.gov. A senior administration official told CNN that some users, particularly those who signed up early on, have experienced difficulties logging in, but the administration is working on a solution. There has also been conflicting information regarding whether some passwords were deleted if they were created in the first week or so after the launch.\n\nSecretary Sebelius acknowledged the website's rocky launch but emphasized that improvements are being made to expedite the enrollment process. However, some Republicans have called for Sebelius to resign, citing the delays and technical failures.\n\nWhen asked about accountability for the website's problems, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated, \"The people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work, fixing the problems that need to be fixed.\" Carney focused on the benefits the uninsured Americans are now entitled to, stating that the goal is for those who have been shut out of affordable health care options in the past to have those options available to them.\n\nFormer White House spokesman Robert Gibbs suggested that, when the website is fixed, those responsible for the problems should be dismissed. Public attention has been focused more on the shutdown fight this month than the problems with enrolling in the exchanges, but with the shutdown ended, part of the emerging Republican message is that the problems with the Obamacare website reflect broader problems with the law overall.\n\nRep. John Fleming (R-Louisiana) stated, \"I think this is emblematic of how problematic this is going to be in the future.\" Fleming suggested that the implementation of the individual mandate, requiring people to obtain health care, should be delayed. A spokeswoman for Sebelius, however, stated that the online enrollment process is proceeding.",
    " Title: Intensified Fighting in Gaza Strip Following Collapse of Ceasefire; Israel Accuses Hamas of Capturing Soldier\n\nArticle:\n\nThe fighting in the Gaza Strip has intensified after a truce brokered by the United States and the United Nations was left in tatters. Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that governs Gaza, each accused the other of violating the ceasefire, which was intended to last for three days and initiate talks for a more lasting settlement.\n\nThe truce, the latest attempt to halt fighting that entered its 26th day today, was aimed at reducing the Palestinian death toll, which, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, has surpassed 1,600 due to Israeli air, ground, and naval bombardments. Israel has reported over 60 military personnel and three civilian casualties in their battle against militants who have fired rockets and infiltrated through underground tunnels.\n\nIsrael alleges that militants use Gaza civilians as human shields by placing rocket launchers and weapons caches in or near homes, mosques, hospitals, and schools. The Israeli military reported hitting approximately 200 targets since the ceasefire unraveled, bringing the total number of strikes to over 4,500 since the conflict began on July 8.\n\nAs the violence escalates, the U.S. House and Senate have approved $225 million in emergency funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile-defense system. The military claims that Iron Dome has intercepted 549 rockets fired at urban areas, including three today. In total, militants have launched 3,030 rockets since the conflict began, according to the military.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has stated that the U.S. will resume efforts to halt the fighting. \"It's going to be very hard to put a ceasefire back together again if Israelis and the international community can't feel confident that Hamas will follow through,\" he said yesterday at the White House.\n\nAl-Qedra, a spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry, accused Israel of violating the truce by shelling Rafah in southern Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Hamas breached the accord by attacking Israeli forces an hour after the ceasefire began, resulting in the death of two soldiers and the suspected capture of a third. Israel identified the missing soldier as Hadar Goldin, 23.\n\nIsraeli army spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner stated that troops destroying a tunnel were attacked by militants, and it \"looks like\" a soldier was taken back through the tunnel. Goldin's father, Simcha, a professor of Judaic Studies at Tel Aviv University, expressed hope that the army would continue searching for his son in Gaza until he is safely returned.\n\nHamas's military wing denied capturing an Israeli soldier. The Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades stated that Israeli ground forces entered Rafah at 2 a.m. yesterday, and a gunfight that broke out at 7 a.m. continued after the ceasefire took effect. Al-Qassam has no information about the missing Israeli soldier, his whereabouts, or the circumstances of his disappearance.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, who helped arrange the accord, condemned the killing of the Israeli soldiers and the suspected abduction as an \"outrageous violation\" of the truce. Israel demands that Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., the European Union, and Israel, should be disarmed under any agreement, while Hamas demands the lifting of an Israeli-Egyptian embargo on the territory.\n\nThe start of the ceasefire was to be followed by negotiations in Cairo, with delegations from Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and the U.S. involved. Egypt's Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that the invitation still stands, though there was no indication any talks would be held. Hamas's allies, Turkey and Qatar, were also involved in the talks that led up to the truce announcement. Kerry has been in contact with both countries since news broke of the missing Israeli soldier, according to a U.S. official who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Releases Data on Payments to Doctors and Hospitals by Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has, for the first time, released data detailing consulting fees, grants, travel expenses, and other gifts that companies have paid to American doctors and teaching hospitals. The data, mandated by the health care law, is part of the Open Payments program and covers disbursements from pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers to over 546,000 physicians and 1,360 teaching hospitals from August 2013 to December 2013. The total amount disbursed is $3.5 billion.\n\nBeginning in June, the reports will be published annually and will include 12 months of data, as announced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner stated, \"CMS is committed to transparency, and this is an opportunity for the public to learn about the relationships among health care providers and pharmaceutical and device companies.\"\n\nThe move is being praised by some as a win for transparency, as public interest groups warn that doctors' prescribing behavior could be affected by financial influence from the companies. However, others have expressed concerns about the data's completeness or accuracy. During testing, some physicians found they had been linked to payments that went to doctors with the same name.\n\nCMS stated that payments do not necessarily imply wrongdoing on the part of doctors and teaching hospitals, and they did not parse out which payments may be beneficial or imply underhanded dealing. Shantanu Agrawal, deputy administrator and director of CMS's Center for Program Integrity, said, \"We are simply making the data available to the public.\"\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the main lobby group for insurers, stated, \"The payments, while not nefarious in every case, are a perfect symbol for the misaligned incentives in our health care system.\" AHIP spokesman Brendan Buck added, \"While most health care stakeholders are working together to find ways to lower costs, drugmakers remain focused on strategies to keep them inflated.\"\n\nApproximately 40 percent of the records do not name the individuals involved in the payments, at least for now, while parties cross-check the information. The agency did not publish more than 190,000 payments, which is stipulated by law because the transactions involved research and disclosure must be withheld for four years or until the product at hand is approved by the FDA, officials said.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, spearheaded the movement to release the data through his Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which passed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. In an op-ed for the Des Moines Register, Mr. Grassley stated that he pushed the legislation because \"it started to become clear how little public information exists on the financial relationships between doctors and pharmaceutical and medical device companies.\" He acknowledged that the database was incomplete and would improve over time, as well as the debate around the data's release.\n\n\"The doctors rightly point out that such payments are perfectly legal, unlike kickbacks to steer prescribers toward certain drugs,\" he wrote. \"But studies have shown that exposure to a prescription drug on the lecture circuit or in the lab leads to more prescriptions for that drug, whether the doctor feels influenced or not.\"",
    " Title: University of Chicago Professor Reinstated After Controversial Tweet on Black Lives Matter and Police Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nA University of Chicago professor, Harold Uhlig, has been reinstated as the head of the Journal of Political Economy following a 10-day investigation into a tweet he made regarding the Black Lives Matter movement and police funding. The tweet, which suggested \"train them better\" instead of \"defund the police,\" sparked a petition demanding his resignation and criticism from prominent economists like Janet Yellen and Paul Krugman.\n\nUhlig's tweet, however, was not a belittlement of the concerns of the less fortunate, as some claimed. According to Robby Soave, a senior editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 magazine who covers the new \"woke\" protests, Uhlig's views differed from the protesters, leading to him being labeled a racist.\n\nThe incident is part of a growing trend where individuals are being targeted and silenced for expressing views that differ from the prevailing narrative of certain social movements. David Shor, an analyst at Democratic polling firm Civis Analytics, faced similar backlash after tweeting a study that concluded \"race riots reduced Democratic vote share.\"\n\nShor was attacked on social media, and despite issuing a groveling apology, he was ultimately fired. Soave points out this \"cruel streak in activism that says, 'If you disagree with me\u2026you have no right to speak.'\"\n\nThe case of Uhlig and Shor is not isolated. A Boeing executive was forced out for opposing women's service in the military\u201430 years ago. A Los Angeles soccer team fired a player because his wife posted racist comments. Michigan State pushed out a physicist when a twitter mob from its \"Graduate Employees Union\" labeled him a \"scientific racist.\"\n\nIn another high-profile case, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is being labeled \"transphobic\" for her views on gender and trans issues. Despite facing backlash, including being refused work by some staff at her publisher and actors in her Harry Potter movies, Rowling has remained vocal and unapologetic.\n\nThe trend of silencing dissenting voices extends to academia as well. A physicist at Michigan State was pushed out after being labeled a \"scientific racist\" for rejecting the idea that scientists should categorically exclude the possibility of average genetic differences among groups.\n\nSoave emphasizes the importance of challenging these individuals and movements that seek to silence dissenting voices. \"We just have to speak up,\" he says. The University of Chicago and Rowling's publisher, among others, have taken a stand in support of free speech. The solution, according to Soave, is to challenge these people and speak up.",
    " Title: Turkey-Russia Tensions Over Syrian Airspace Highlight Challenges in Building an International Coalition Against IS\n\nArticle:\n\nThe shoot-down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on Tuesday highlights the difficulties in building a broad international coalition to destroy the Islamic State (IS), also known as ISIS. Over a year after President Obama announced the creation of a coalition of more than 50 countries to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" IS, there is still no effective alliance of major powers.\n\nFrench President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who was at the White House on Tuesday and will be in Russia on Friday, has made building a coalition his goal in the wake of the Paris attacks. However, the same challenge remains: the major players deeply mistrust one another's intentions and visions for a post-Islamic State Syria.\n\nBarry Strauss, a military historian at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, states, \"It was never going to be easy to build a coalition against ISIS, given the complicated relations and competing alliances around the Syrian conflict. But clearly, an event of this seriousness between Russia and Turkey will only make that effort more difficult.\"\n\nTurkey and Russia exemplify the complex and often contradictory motives that Mr. Hollande will try to manage. The anti-IS coalition supposedly has similar aims to Turkey's: the removal from power of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as a key step toward reducing IS's allure for Syrian Sunnis. However, it took months of sustained diplomatic effort for the United States to bring Turkey on board. Even now, the differences between the US and Turkey remain pronounced.\n\nFrom the US perspective, perhaps the most effective fighters against IS have been Syrian and Iraqi Kurds \u2013 so much so that the US has sent special operations forces to the region to help them. However, Turkey has a large Kurdish population and worries that empowering Kurds anywhere in the region might create trouble at home.\n\nIn fact, Turkey has been \"friendlier towards ISIS than Russia\" because of Turkey's satisfaction with the setbacks that IS has dealt Syria's Kurdish rebels.\n\nSimilarly, many countries in the region \"find ISIS useful to have around and are in no rush to get rid of it\" because it is virulently anti-Shiite, Professor Strauss notes. In that way, IS acts \"as a counterbalance to Iran and the Shiite parties in the region.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia says it entered the Syrian conflict to defeat Syria's \"terrorists,\" but analysts say its airstrikes in Syria have focused on Assad's opponents. Only about a quarter have been against IS, experts say.\n\nGetting Turkey and Russia on the same page for destroying IS \u2013 a priority for neither \u2013 was always going to be difficult. After the Russian jet shoot-down, the task will be even harder when Hollande meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.\n\nMr. Putin called the downing of the Russian jet a \"stab in the back\" carried out by \"accomplices of terrorists,\" and he warned that the perpetrators of the \"crime\" will face \"serious consequences.\"\n\nRussia canceled Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's visit to Turkey on Wednesday, while NATO called an emergency meeting of alliance ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday's incident was the first shoot-down of a Russian aircraft by a NATO country since the 1950s, officials said.\n\nRussia insists the fighter jet did not stray outside Syria, while Turkish officials said the jet was warned 10 times to turn back from its trajectory into Turkish airspace. President Obama called on Russia, Turkey, and NATO countries to \"discourage any escalation,\" but also asserted that \"Turkey, like every country, has the right to defend its territory and its airspace.\"\n\nRussia is likely to look at the aftermath of the incident as validation that all groups arrayed against Assad are terrorists. A video released following the shoot-down shows Syrian Turkmen rebels claiming to have shot dead two Russian pilots as they parachuted to the ground.\n\nA separate incident further illustrates the difficulty of building a united anti-IS coalition that includes Russia. A group of Syrian rebels armed by the US claims to have damaged a Russian military helicopter, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Syrian government-held territory.\n\nYet Strauss says perhaps the more formidable impediment to an effective coalition is the widespread ambiguity in the region toward the Islamic State. The region's Sunni powers \"may worry about ISIS in the long term, but to some extent they see its usefulness in the short term,\" he says. That calculation does not fit with Western powers that \u2013 now more than ever \u2013 want to see IS's demise \"sooner rather than later.\"",
    " Title: Mike Pence Faces Protests at Evangelical College in Virginia\n\nArticle:\n\nMike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced protests and a lackluster turnout during a stump speech at Patrick Henry College in Purcellville, Virginia, on Saturday. The evangelical Christian college, known for its anti-Trump sentiment, has a history of opposing Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nStudents protested outside the college, while some stood in silent protest inside until they were ejected mid-speech. The protests and poor attendance at the speech illustrate the challenges that Trump has in appealing to evangelical Christians, especially younger ones, who are turned off by his tone, his campaign ideas, and his personal history, and are not assuaged by his choice of Pence for his running mate.\n\nSebastian Lopez, a junior studying political theory at the school, was protesting the speech, holding a sign for hours outside in the blazing mid-day sun. \"The PHC student body as a whole is very anti-Trump. A lot of them say, 'I don't like him but I'm going to turn up my nose and vote for him because I like Hillary even less,'\" said Lopez.\n\nChristian McGuire, a junior at Patrick Henry College studying American politics who was also demonstrating against Pence, estimated 75 percent of the student body opposed Trump. McGuire added, \"I don't think that Mike Pence is a bad person, but I think he has made an alliance with someone who is completely unacceptable from a libertarian, conservative, or progressive standpoint.\"\n\nPence's visit is not the first misstep by the Trump campaign in Virginia. Donald Trump flubbed his speech in Northern Virginia earlier this month when he lectured the affluent locals in the audience as if they were the Rust Belt and listed factory closures in far-flung areas of the state that were hours away, as well as a plant that closed in North Carolina.\n\nPatrick Henry College is located in Loudoun County, the affluent swing district an hour from Washington, D.C., that voted for Bush twice, and then Obama twice. It's as close to a must-win county as it gets.\n\nWhen Marco Rubio visited in February during the Republican primaries, students and local residents crammed into the room, filling the bleachers, the gymnasium floor, and the balconies above to get a glimpse of the presidential candidate. The road outside the college was jam-packed. Parking was a nightmare. An enthusiastic Students for Rubio group existed during the primaries. To this day, there is no pro-Trump group on campus.\n\n\"There are certainly students who support Trump, though most are not enthusiastic. He was rarely the first choice in such a crowded primary field,\" said Tim Kocher, a spokesman for the Patrick Henry College Republicans. \"I believe Trump has a solid base of support around 15-20%, but many students simply have not made up their minds as far as the presidential race goes.\"\n\nWhen Pence visited Saturday, the room was half-empty. A whole set of retractable bleachers sat empty and discarded near the stage; no admiring crowds leaned over the balcony to get a better look at the politician; parking was a breeze. This lackluster turnout took place at a school which in fall 2015 registered just 294 students, yet had about as many White House interns during the Bush administration as Georgetown University, with its nearly 18,000 students.\n\n\"I'm a B-list Republican celebrity,\" Pence said self-deprecatingly, as he thanked attendees for showing up on a beautiful, cloudless Saturday afternoon. It was funny because it was kind of sad, and it was sad because it was kind of true.\n\nPence also spoke as if he did not quite understand whose ticket he was on. \"We believe in free trade,\" he said, as if Trump had not run a campaign slamming international trade. The governor also slammed Hillary Clinton's plan to tax the rich, as if the Republican nominee had not taken aim at Wall Street during his populist run for the White House. Americans are \"tired of politicians who divide our country to unite their support,\" he said, as if Trump had not run a campaign that regularly disparaged Muslims, foreigners, and women.\n\nAs if to bolster this point, a group of protesters critical of Trump's rhetoric on Islam revealed their T-shirts during Pence's speech, engaging in a silent protest of the Republican ticket as they were slowly escorted out. Even the students who supported the Trump-Pence ticket seemed to be doing so with an air of resignation, buoyed only by the threat they believe Hillary Clinton poses to the country.\n\nSarah Roberts, a student at the college who attended the speech, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"I haven't done the research to be, like, 'Woo-hoo,' but he's better than the alternative.\"\n\n\"Our options are a little limited, so we're going to have to choose between worse and worse,\" said another student carrying a Trump-Pence sign. \"It's a very conservative school, one of the most conservative schools in the nation... a lot of people don't really believe he's very conservative.\"\n\nMeanwhile, outside Patrick Henry College, nearly 20 students and alumni from the predominantly conservative school demonstrated against Pence and Trump, to make the point that the Christian college did not support the Republican ticket.\n\n\"I don't want my school, and therefore my name, associated with [Trump],\" said Erin Lester, an alumni of the school. \"It's known for being a conservative school... and I don't want people to assume that because it's a conservative school, that we're Trump's dupes, basically.\"\n\nThe protests for the swing area of Loudoun County continued out in the street outside Patrick Henry College's main entrance, where students held signs reading \"PHC is Not Trump Country,\" \"Immigrants Make America Great,\" and \"For Christ and Liberty, Not Bigotry And Idiocy.\" Some locals passed, honking in support. Eventually, a car drove by, and its angry occupant flipped the bird, yelling \"TRUMP!\"",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Apologizes for Past Native American Heritage Claims at Iowa Forum\n\nArticle:\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren offered a public apology Monday to Native Americans over her past claim to tribal heritage, directly addressing an area that has proven to be a significant political liability.\n\n\"Like anyone who has been honest with themselves, I know I have made mistakes,\" the Massachusetts senator said at a forum on Native American issues in this pivotal early voting state. \"I am sorry for the harm I have caused.\"\n\nMonday's remarks were an effort to move past the fallout from her past claims of tribal ancestry, which culminated in a widely criticized release of a DNA analysis last year. The issue nearly derailed her campaign in the early days as President Donald Trump began derisively referring to her as \"Pocahontas.\"\n\nNow that Warren is gaining in most polls, she is trying to prove to voters that the controversy won't doom her in a general election matchup against Trump. The detailed policy agenda to help Native Americans that she released last week helped secure a warm reception from attendees at the tribal forum.\n\nAfter drawing a standing ovation, Warren said \"I have listened and I have learned a lot\" from conversations with Native Americans in recent months, describing herself as \"grateful\" for the dialogue. She fielded questions about her proposals, which include a legislative change for a Supreme Court ruling that impedes tribal governments' ability to prosecute crimes committed on tribal lands by those who don't belong to a tribe.\n\nShe did not receive any questions about her own background.\n\nWarren's DNA analysis\u2014part of a broader pushback against Trump's disparaging nickname\u2014showed evidence of a tribal ancestor as far as 10 generations back, but the Cherokee Nation joined some other Native Americans in rebuking the senator for attributing tribal membership to genetics. Warren later apologized privately to the Cherokee and had addressed her regret before Monday's appearance.\n\nAs of Monday, her campaign website's page containing a video and other materials Warren had released on the DNA analysis was no longer active.\n\nThe Native American forum this week is expected to draw 10 of her White House rivals.\n\nNew Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland, who last year became one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress, introduced Warren on Monday after endorsing her presidential campaign last month and aligning with her for new legislation aimed at helping tribal communities. Haaland lamented that Warren's ancestry has attracted outsized attention when Trump faces his own charges of racism.\n\nThose who \"ask about Elizabeth's family instead of issues of vital importance to Indian Country,\" Haaland told the forum audience, \"feed the president's racism.\"\n\nWarren's remarks were well-received by attendees at the Native American forum.\n\nManny Iron Hawk, 62, who lives on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation in South Dakota, said Warren \"did excellent\" in her Monday appearance and has done a good job of addressing her past mistakes. \"I think she did. A person has to admit their mistakes and move on.\"\n\nIron Hawk said he had hoped to talk to Warren about tribal governance issues, but she left too quickly for him to catch her.\n\nSnuffy Main, 64, who traveled to the conference from Montana, said he doesn't think Warren needs to continue apologizing for claiming Native American heritage.\n\n\"I don't understand why she is constantly apologetic for making a mistake,\" said Main, who is a member of the Gros Ventre Tribe of Montana. He said he liked what Warren had to say about making sure the country honors its promises and treaties with tribes.\n\n\"If she can do even a fraction of what she promised, that would be beneficial,\" he said.\n\nGary Funmaker, 72, of Black River Falls, Wisconsin, said Warren had \"good energy to her\" and he didn't see much need for further apology.\n\n\"That's accepted. That's old news,\" said Funmaker, a Republican who used to work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nLater Monday, Warren campaigned in Minnesota, a state Trump hopes to take out of Democrats' column next year. The senator drew her largest crowd yet\u201412,000 people, according to her campaign\u2014to an outdoor rally at Macalester College, a private liberal arts school in St. Paul.\n\n\"I don't want a government that works for giant multinational corporations. I want one that works for our families,\" she told the crowd.\n\nSchor reported from Washington. \u2588\u2588\u2588 writer Kathleen Hennessey contributed to this report from St. Paul, Minn.",
    " Title: FBI Under Scrutiny for Inaction on Florida School Shooting Tip\n\nArticle:\n\nPressure is mounting on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) following the agency's admission that it failed to act on a tip about Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The shooting resulted in the deaths of 17 individuals, making it the deadliest US school shooting since 2012.\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott has called for FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a review, expressing disappointment in the FBI's actions. Some of those close to the victims have also voiced their dismay. President Donald Trump met with survivors of the attack and thanked law enforcement for their response to the tragedy.\n\nNikolas Cruz, 19, has confessed to the attack and has been charged with 17 counts of murder. The shooting re-ignited debates about gun control, with many students from the school weighing in.\n\nOn January 5, a person close to Cruz contacted the FBI's tip line, providing information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting. The FBI stated that this information should have been assessed as a potential threat to life and passed on to the Miami field office, but that \"we have determined these protocols were not followed.\"\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray stated that the bureau was \"still investigating the facts\" and was committed to \"getting to the bottom of what happened.\" He also expressed regret for the additional pain caused to those affected by the tragedy.\n\nIn September, a disturbing comment was left on a YouTube video by a user named \"nikolas cruz,\" stating, \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\" The comment was reported to the FBI, but the agency was unable to identify the person behind the comment at the time.\n\nQuestions are also being raised about how local police responded to concerns about Nikolas Cruz. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel stated that his office had received 20 \"calls for service\" about Cruz. Each call would be scrutinized, he said, without going into detail about the nature of the calls.\n\nGovernor Scott stated that the FBI's failure to act was \"unacceptable\" and called for Wray's resignation. At a funeral for 18-year-old victim Meadow Pollack, family friend Jeff Richman questioned the value of the FBI's apology, stating, \"The FBI apologized? Tell that to families.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced a review at the justice department and FBI into how \"indications of potential violence\" are responded to. The FBI has been criticized in the past for being aware of a potential threat and failing to thwart an attack, such as the gunman of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting in Texas and the gunman who killed 49 people in a gay club in Orlando, Florida, in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, the FBI received about 1,300 tips a day through its website, which is staffed around the clock by two dozen people. In addition to online tips, FBI field offices receive dozens of calls. About 100 of the tips are considered \"actionable.\"\n\nCruz had been expelled from the school he has confessed to attacking, and some students stated they had previously joked he would one day \"shoot up the school.\" One former schoolmate, Chad Williams, described Cruz as an \"outcast\" who was \"crazy about guns.\" His interest in weapons was apparent on his social media profiles, which the Broward County sheriff said were \"very, very disturbing.\" Cruz had reportedly been treated for mental health issues at a clinic.",
    " Title: Ford's Testimony in Senate Hearing Praised as Credible and Brave\n\nArticle:\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor from California, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, September 27, 2018, alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. Ford, who was previously unknown to the public, emerged as a significant figure in the #MeToo movement, with many American women identifying with her emotional account of the alleged assault.\n\nFord's testimony was met with praise for her credibility and bravery, despite thousands of conservatives accusing her of lying to bring down Kavanaugh. Republican senators depicted her testimony as partisan, while being careful not to personally attack Ford. However, many prominent conservatives, such as Alice Stewart, Mike Cernovich, Chris Wallace, and Moira Donegan, praised Ford for her credibility and emotional impact.\n\nFord's testimony was emotional, with her voice cracking at times, and she appeared close to tears at several points. A GoFundMe page to support Ford and pay for her security and legal expenses quickly doubled its fundraising total after it was mentioned during the hearing. RAINN, a support hotline for victims of sexual assault and crimes, saw a 147% increase in people reaching out for help during the hearing.\n\nAn analysis of social media sentiment conducted by the Ipsos polling firm using an artificial intelligence prototype found that positive sentiment directed toward Ford increased each time she spoke. However, it measured posts on Twitter and Facebook and was not a representation of total public sentiment.\n\nKathleen Pierman, 66, who watched the testimony at home, was convinced by Ford's testimony and found Kavanaugh more convincing than expected. However, Pierman believed confirming Kavanaugh would be a \"huge mistake\" because \"no one will trust the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThree political scientists who specialize in voting behavior and political psychology told their sources they expected Ford's testimony to galvanize female Democratic voters to vote in November.",
    " Title: Wealthier but Lonely: The Paradox of American Society and Its Impact on Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nA paradox has emerged in American society, as indicated by a contrast between increasing standards of living and increased social anxiety and unhappiness. Despite a booming economy, low unemployment rates, and rising wages, Americans report declining happiness levels and a sense of disconnectedness.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a United Nations initiative, attributes the decline in self-reported happiness to weakening social support networks in the U.S. Over the past few decades, marriage rates have dropped significantly, with the number of never-married individuals approaching parity with married individuals. The average number of people per household has also decreased from 3.33 in 1960 to 2.57 today, leading to a dramatic shrinking of social networks.\n\nSurveys show a rise in loneliness, with progressive generational declines in the art of friendship. On average, Americans have one fewer close friend today than a generation ago, and many men report having no close friendships. The youngest Americans, who use social media the most, are socializing the least \"in real life.\"\n\nDespite America's reputation as a religiously devout nation, church attendance has been consistently declining over the past few decades. Barna now estimates that the population of \"unchurched\" people, 43 percent, has exceeded the population of active churchgoers.\n\nOne of the happiest and most upwardly mobile cities is Salt Lake City, Utah, which has a strong religious institution at its core. The culture of Utah is infused with the spirit created by a coherent religious culture that, despite being a minority faith in the country, has the solidarity of a religious community. Salt Lake City is tied with Chattanooga for the country's most churched city.\n\nThe decline in neighborliness is another significant trend. Fewer Americans know their next-door neighbors, and fewer still regularly interact with them. This decline is reflected in fewer acts of everyday charity and philanthropy, as well as declines in civic and ethnic organizations.\n\nThis depletion and disappearance of a social treasury, as the author refers to it, are the background noise of American politics today. The two insurgent ideological trends on the left and right - socialism and nationalism, respectively - emphasize shared burdens and our duties to one another.\n\nThe depletion of the social treasure informs the politics of the Right's populists, explaining some of the contrast between the feelings of precarity that Trump voters report and the income stats that suggest they may be doing just fine, or better. It also partly explains the upsurge in socialism.\n\nHowever, it is not just the working class that is affected by these trends. America's elites are not immune either. They may have the means to navigate a world in which their communal life has been almost entirely displaced by a networking life. But, they often succeed more when liberated from a life that would impose obligations, throwing themselves more fully into careers and social milieux that run on a more disguised form of conditional favor-trading, rather than reciprocal duties.\n\nPoliticians will have to learn to address an America that is wealthier and lonelier, as politics has become one of the only arenas in which Americans can collectively discuss the quality of their social relations and their sense of morality. However, because they see so clearly how much their outcomes in life depend on the favors they put into and extract out of a network, they dread their loss of status, which they value most keenly. While leisure hasn't entirely died among American elites, they constantly betray themselves as overworked and under-cultivated.\n\nThe decline of the social treasury is not easily amenable to political policy. Until Utah Senator Mike Lee used his position on the Joint Economic Committee to pioneer a social-capital index, it was barely visible to them. But because politics has become one of the only arenas in which Americans can collectively discuss the quality of their social relations and their sense of morality, politicians will at least have to learn to address an America that is wealthier and lonelier, that has higher standards of living but lives marked by quiet desperation, that works hard but doesn't know why anymore.",
    " Title: Federal Judges to Hear Appeal on Trump's Revised Travel Ban, Senate Intel Committee Invites James Comey to Testify\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration will present arguments on Monday before a federal appeals court in an attempt to reverse a judge's ruling that blocked the implementation of the second version of the president's controversial travel ban. The arguments will be heard in Seattle before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick K. Watson's March 16 decision halted the overhauled travel ban, a policy the administration claims is a crucial component of a strategy to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country.\n\nAssociates of former FBI Director James Comey believe that his first comments on his termination would likely come in an open session before Congress. Comey declined an invitation to speak to a closed session of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday and was replaced on a panel testifying before that committee last Thursday by his temporary replacement, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-Va.) expressed his desire for Comey to testify in a public hearing about his firing. \"I think Jim Comey deserves his chance to lay out to the American public his side of the facts,\" Warner told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" on Sunday morning.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley defended President Trump's firing of Comey, stating that he can \"fire anyone he wants.\" Haley added that the criticism of Trump stems from discomfort with his propensity to act on his decisions.\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Russia likely views Comey's firing as \"another victory on the scoreboard for them.\" Clapper noted that the removal of the lead of the investigation about potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign has been removed.\n\nThe U.S. believes the ballistic missile North Korea launched on Saturday was a KN-17 medium range missile and not a new intermediate range missile, as had been speculated. The launch marked the first successful test of the missile, three previous launches in April had ended in failure.\n\nReports suggest that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus recently warned senior staff to stop trying to secretly slip news articles to President Trump. Additionally, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to significantly expand the pro-life Mexico City Policy. Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara wrote an opinion piece questioning whether there are still public servants who will say no to the president.",
    " Title: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Discusses Congressional Pay Raise and Cost of Living Adjustment\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has expressed concerns about the potential lack of a cost-of-living adjustment for members of Congress, which could result in a $4,500 pay raise. According to Fox News' Gregg Re, there has not been a cost-of-living adjustment for Congress members for the past nine years.\n\nIn a conversation with Fox News' Chad Pergram on Monday, Ocasio-Cortez, who earns $174,000 per year, discussed the issue of Congressional pay raises. She stated that the pressure to turn to lobbying firms and cash in on member services after leaving Congress is due to the lack of cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nOcasio-Cortez argued that efforts to increase Congressional pay are superficial and that voting against pay increases might not be politically popular but is necessary to fight for pay increases for American workers. She advocated for a $15 minimum wage pegged to inflation for all workers in the United States.\n\nThe Congresswoman continued, stating that members of Congress, retail workers, and everyone should receive cost-of-living increases to accommodate for changes in the economy. She argued that bypassing cost-of-living adjustments increases the pressure on members to exploit legal loopholes to enrich themselves.\n\nOcasio-Cortez concluded by stating that while voting against a cost-of-living adjustment might not look good in terms of political optics, it is essential to be transparent about cost-of-living increases. She emphasized that every cost-of-living adjustment bypassed is a vote to increase the pressure to exploit legal loopholes and enrich oneself through service.",
    " Title: Sanders Condemns Sandra Bland's Arrest, Calls for Police Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIndependent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has criticized the conduct of the officer involved in the arrest of Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old African American woman who died in police custody in a small Texas town last week. Sanders is the only presidential candidate to publicly address Bland's death.\n\nThe arrest and subsequent death of Bland, which occurred on July 13, sparked a national outcry after local officials ruled her death a suicide in a jail cell. However, cellphone footage later released showed Bland yelling during the arrest that the officer had slammed her head on the ground. Authorities stated that Bland hung herself with a plastic bag in a jail cell three days later.\n\nFollowing a tense encounter with Black Lives Matter activists at the Netroots Nation conference in Phoenix on Saturday, Sanders added a passage to his stump speech in Houston on Sunday, referencing Bland's death. He stated, \"It is unacceptable that police officers beat up people or kill people. If they do that, they have got to be held accountable.\"\n\nAfter dashcam video of Bland's arrest was released last night, showing the officer, who had pulled Bland over for failing to signal a turn, open Bland's driver-side door and threaten to \"light her up\" with his taser if she did not stop smoking a cigarette and exit the vehicle, Sanders released a statement Tuesday condemning the arrest. He described the video as showing \"totally outrageous police behavior.\"\n\nSanders continued, \"No one should be yanked from her car, thrown to the ground, assaulted, and arrested for a minor traffic stop. The result is that three days later she is dead in her jail cell. This video highlights once again why we need real police reform. People should not die for a minor traffic infraction. This type of police abuse has become an all-too-common occurrence for people of color, and it must stop.\"\n\nTwo Texas state lawmakers have already labeled Bland's arrest as unlawful, but neither of the two Texas presidential candidates, Sen. Ted Cruz and former Governor Rick Perry, have commented on Bland's case. Sanders is the only presidential candidate to mention Bland on the campaign trail, so far. Activists have utilized the #SayHerName hashtag on social media to draw attention to the Bland case.",
    " Title: The Need for a Long-Term Strategy in Syria: A Call for Integrated Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Syrian conflict, now in its sixth year, has prompted calls for the United States to adopt a long-term strategy. The author, Michael O' Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argues that while President Barack Obama's reluctance to engage in Syria's civil war is understandable, a policy of inaction has allowed Syrian President Bashar Assad to remain in power and facilitated the rise of extremist insurgent groups.\n\nThe author suggests that the U.S. should respond to the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons, a \"red line\" Obama had previously established, not only to re-establish U.S. credibility but also to re-establish deterrence. The concern is that if the Syrian regime is not deterred from using chemical weapons, it may continue to do so more widely, and the same could apply to Iran's nuclear program.\n\nHowever, the author cautions against limited military action, such as cruise-missile strikes, due to their limited effects and the challenges in targeting Syrian army units or chemical weapons depots. Instead, the author advocates for an integrated strategy for ending the war, involving a future political settlement among the belligerents. This strategy would require time, potentially involving the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops, and would likely involve a peace implementation force from NATO, the Arab League, and other Islamic countries.\n\nThe author warns that without such a strategy, Syria could become a new Somalia, offering sanctuaries to terrorists and causing instability in the region. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for a long-term strategy, rather than an immediate response to the latest tragedy in Syria. The strategy should define a future political settlement, protect all groups, including minorities, and involve a Bosnia-style peace implementation force. The author also calls for international consensus and support for this strategy, acknowledging that it will not be risk- or cost-free but will be a far less daunting effort than either Iraq or Afghanistan.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Challenges Constitutionality of Defense of Marriage Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law signed into effect in 1996 that bans same-sex married couples from receiving federal benefits, appeared to be on shaky ground at the Supreme Court on Wednesday. During the hearing, a majority of justices expressed doubts about the constitutionality of the 17-year-old law.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, who has often been the deciding vote on similar issues, seemed to be leaning towards siding with the four liberal justices expected to vote for the overturning of DOMA. However, Kennedy's concerns appeared to focus on the traditional right of states to define marriage, rather than a fairness question for gay couples.\n\nPaul Clement, the sole lawyer arguing for the constitutionality of the 1996 law, was retained by Republican leaders in the House after President Barack Obama decided in 2011 that the Justice Department would no longer defend the statute. Clement argued that Congress's key interest in passing the law was preserving the uniform treatment of couples in various states at a time when some states might allow same-sex marriages.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, however, argued that Congress wasn't preserving tradition but departing from it when it jumped into the marriage issue. She pointed out that the foray into the issue in 1996 was so unusual that it \"sent up a pretty big red flag.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's hearing on Wednesday followed Tuesday's hearing on a case that asks the court to overturn California's same-sex marriage ban, known as Prop. 8. The case was brought by Edith Windsor, a New York woman who was forced to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes after her same-sex spouse died in 2009. If the couple had been heterosexual, no tax would have been due, but under DOMA federal tax law treated the pair as unmarried.\n\nA previous version of this story misspelled Sri Srinivasan's name.",
    " Title: Navy SEAL Trial Exposes Alleged War Crimes and Divisions Within Elite Force\n\nArticle:\n\nA court-martial at Naval Base San Diego is currently underway for Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a 19-year Navy SEAL veteran and Bronze Star recipient, who is charged with murder, attempted murder, and conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline for posing with the corpse of an Islamic State captive he allegedly stabbed and for shooting civilians in Iraq in 2017. The trial has provided a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the Navy SEAL community, revealing challenges within U.S. special forces and shedding light on the insular nature of one of the military's most secretive and revered forces.\n\nThe trial has been marked by a heated debate between veterans over brotherhood, morality, and loyalty. The case has also highlighted the struggles of military courts in prosecuting alleged war crimes, with the lead prosecutor being removed for allegedly tracking the defense team's emails to find a news leak, and the lead investigator acknowledging mistakes.\n\nThe trial has laid bare a WhatsApp group chat, dubbed \"The Sewing Circle,\" formed by a select few members of Alpha platoon after their return from deployment in 2017. In the group chat, Gallagher was referred to as \"El Diablo,\" Spanish for \"the devil.\" The group allegedly served as a platform for orchestrating a smear campaign against their demanding platoon chief.\n\nNearly a dozen SEALs have testified over the past two weeks, with most being granted immunity to protect them from being prosecuted for acts they described on the stand. Seven SEALs testified that Gallagher unexpectedly stabbed the prisoner on May 3, 2017, moments after he and the other medics treated the 17-year-old boy. Two SEALs testified they saw Gallagher plunge his knife into the prisoner's neck, including Special Operator Corey Scott, who stunned the court when he said he was the one who ultimately killed the teen by plugging his breathing tube with his thumb as an act of mercy. The Navy is reportedly considering perjury charges against Scott.\n\nThe trial is expected to conclude with closing arguments on Monday, as the jury of five Marines and two sailors, one a SEAL, weighs the evidence presented. The jury will decide whether Gallagher, on his eighth deployment, went off the rails and fatally stabbed the war prisoner as a kind of trophy kill, or if the boy died from wounds sustained in an airstrike and Gallagher is being falsely accused by junior SEALs trying to permanently oust a platoon chief they hate.\n\nThe trial has also revealed the behavior of the special warfare teams, with the Navy's top commanders conducting a review into the matter. Lt. Jacob Portier, the officer in charge, has been charged separately for overseeing the ceremony and not reporting the alleged stabbing. The trial has also shown the struggles of military courts in prosecuting alleged war crimes, with the lead prosecutor being removed and the lead investigator acknowledging mistakes.",
    " Title: FBI Director's Handling of Anti-Trump Dossier Raises Questions in Senate Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nFBI Director James Comey's consideration of an anti-Trump dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer as significant enough to include in the final intelligence community report on Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election has sparked questions during a recent Senate hearing. Sources familiar with the matter, who declined to speak on record due to its sensitivity and relevance to ongoing testimony on the unmasking of American citizens in the FBI's probe into alleged contacts between Trump campaign advisers and Moscow, reportedly told Fox News about the inclusion of the dossier.\n\nThe dossier, which was part of the evidence the FBI used to obtain a FISA warrant for Carter Page, a peripheral figure in the Trump campaign, has been a subject of controversy. In an interview with Fox News, Page denied the dossier's central allegations that he was the Trump campaign's point person for Moscow.\n\nThe dossier, which contained salacious allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump, was also included as an attachment in the classified version of the intelligence report issued at the end of the Obama administration. Both President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump were presented with the findings.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) raised questions about the bureau's relationship with Christopher Steele, the former British officer who wrote the dossier, and his British company Orbis, as well as their relationship with Washington, D.C.-based Fusion GPS.\n\nIn the hearing, Comey declined to confirm or deny if Fusion GPS is part of the Russian intelligence apparatus or if he agreed that Fusion GPS's involvement in preparing the anti-Trump dossier would constitute Russian interference in the election. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the committee's chairman, expressed his frustration at the lack of response from the director of the FBI, citing the bureau's failure to meet deadlines and respond to his questions.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee who also sits on the intelligence committee, told CNN on Wednesday that she does not \"at this time\" have evidence of collusion between Trump associates and Russia during the campaign.\n\nA letter of complaint against Fusion GPS was filed with the Justice Department, alleging the company and its founder, former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson, violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In response to the complaint's allegation that Fusion GPS acted as an unregistered agent for Russian interests, attorney Joshua A. Levy told Fox News' senior executive producer Pamela Browne via email that \"Fusion GPS has complied with the law and was not required to register under FARA. Nor has Fusion GPS ever been a Russian agent. Allegations to the contrary are not true.\"\n\nGrassley expressed concerns that the FBI has relied on the dossier to justify the current investigation. He questioned the origin of the money used to fund the dossier and the motivations of those writing the checks. During the hearing, Grassley also chided the FBI for providing materially inconsistent information and noted that the man who wrote the dossier admitted in court that it contains unverified claims.\n\nA British court document, first reported by The Guardian and signed by Steele, offers a glimpse into his company's work for Fusion GPS. The document describes \"unsolicited intelligence\" and \"raw intelligence\" that \"needed to be analyzed and further investigated/verified.\" Fox News has filed a formal request for copies of court documents with the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court in London.",
    " Title: White House Immigration Policy: Uncertainty and Lack of Consistency\n\nArticle:\n\nThe current focus lies on the ongoing DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) issue, with President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress facing criticism for their handling of the Dreamers. The Dreamers, as Trump described them last February, are \"absolutely incredible kids\" who deserve to be treated \"with heart.\" However, in September, he initiated the termination of the program if Congress did not find a permanent solution by March 5. Two weeks ago, Trump promised a \"bill of love,\" but two days later, he rejected a bipartisan deal aimed at addressing the issue.\n\nOn Friday, hours before the government shutdown deadline, Trump reportedly reached an agreement with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that would have protected Dreamers and increased border security. However, he later reversed course, allegedly due to pressure from immigration hardliners within the White House, including Chief of Staff John Kelly and Senior Adviser Stephen Miller. On Sunday, Trump criticized Democrats, accusing them of wanting \"illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.\"\n\nThe inconsistency and lack of clear direction from the White House have led to confusion and uncertainty. As stated by Senator Schumer, negotiating with the president is \"like negotiating with Jell-O.\" This ambiguity has reportedly contributed to the recent government shutdown.\n\nIn contrast, during the 2013 government shutdown, President Barack Obama, who was clear from the start that he would not negotiate on defunding the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislative achievement, eventually prevailed.\n\nIn 2018, the White House is occupied by a president with no apparent principles beyond promoting his own brand and securing \"wins,\" as he put it. His disinterest in the specifics of governing has led him to state that he would sign any immigration bill sent to him by lawmakers. Negotiating with a chief executive who lacks a clear understanding of what constitutes a good deal presents challenges for all parties involved.",
    " Title: New York Times Editorial Questions U.S. Military's Celebration of White Supremacy in Naming Military Bases\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Times Editorial Board published an editorial on Sunday, titled \"Why Does the U.S. Military Celebrate White Supremacy?\" The piece argues that it is time to rename military bases after \"American heroes, not racist traitors.\"\n\nThe editorial contends that the federal government embraced white supremacist ideology when it named military bases in the South, citing examples such as Fort Benning, Georgia, which honors Confederate General Henry Lewis Benning. The editorial notes that Benning, in a 1861 speech, expressed support for the preservation of slavery and his belief that African-Americans were not fully human.\n\nThe editorial also points to Fort Benning's namesake as a Confederate general who may have been a leader of the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War. Another Georgia base, Fort Gordon, is named after Confederate General John Brown Gordon, who was a leader of the Georgia Ku Klux Klan and may have taken on a broader role in the terrorist organization when its first national leader, Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, suffered declining health.\n\nThe editorial board references comments made by an Army spokesman in 2015, who stated that there was no need to remove Confederate base names because the \"historic names represent individuals, not causes or ideologies.\" The editorial counters this argument, stating that the men honored by the bases were traitors and that the names represent oppression before and during the Civil War, as well as state-sponsored bigotry after it.\n\nThe editorial concludes by stating that bases named for men who sought to destroy the Union in the name of racial injustice are an insult to the ideals that servicemen and women are sworn to uphold and an embarrassing artifact of a time when the military itself embraced anti-American values. The editorial board calls for the renaming of these bases.\n\nIn response to the editorial, President Trump criticized the New York Times and its publisher, stating, \"I laugh at them all.\"",
    " Title: Mike Bloomberg Campaigns Across Super Tuesday States, Promises to \"Get It Done\"\n\nArticle:\n\nMike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, has embarked on a whirlwind tour of states participating in Super Tuesday, the primary election on March 3, in an attempt to capitalize on the unsettled Democratic presidential race. Polls indicate that Bloomberg is gaining traction, as Joe Biden, the previous front-runner, has struggled following disappointing finishes in the first two contests.\n\nBloomberg is bypassing the early states and focusing on demonstrating his campaign's viability through strong performances on Super Tuesday. His campaign strategy includes a busy schedule of events and substantial television advertising, reinforcing the campaign slogan, \"Mike will get it done,\" which is featured in ads, posters, T-shirts, and other campaign materials.\n\nDuring his campaign stops, Bloomberg avoids direct attacks on his Democratic opponents and does not mention them by name. He pledges to support the Democratic nominee if he is not the nominee himself. In a clear reference to Bernie Sanders, who advocates for revolutionary change, Bloomberg states, \"We need evolution, not a revolution.\"\n\nBloomberg's primary focus is on defeating President Donald Trump, whom he portrays as a national emergency. He positions himself as someone who has amassed a fortune estimated to exceed $60 billion, implying that Trump cannot intimidate him. He asserts, \"I'm a New Yorker, and I'm not afraid of Donald Trump.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's recent insults, Bloomberg used his rallies to counterattack, stating, \"He calls me Little Mike, and the answer is, 'Donald, where I come from, we measure from your neck up.'\"\n\nBloomberg's attacks on Trump were met with cheers in cities such as Chattanooga, Nashville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, and Raleigh. Some attendees are still undecided, while others, like retiree Michael Day, support Bloomberg as the best candidate to defeat Trump.\n\nHowever, not all reactions to Bloomberg have been positive. This week, two stories from his past resurfaced, including comments he made in 2015 about New York City's stop-and-frisk policy, which disproportionately targeted African Americans, and his 2008 remarks on the end of the discriminatory lending practice known as \"redlining.\"\n\nThe Bloomberg campaign has responded to these issues with endorsements from African American mayors and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as a plan to help a million more Black families buy a house and counteract the effects of redlining and the subprime mortgage crisis.\n\nAs Bloomberg is not on the ballot in the upcoming states of Nevada and South Carolina, his appeal to voters can only be measured by his polling numbers. He continues to air television commercials highlighting his stance on climate change, gun violence, and featuring clips of Barack Obama praising him.\n\nVoters will have their first opportunity to assess Bloomberg's formidability as a candidate on Super Tuesday.",
    " Title: Rarity of Convictions in Police Shooting Cases: A Look at the Factors Influencing Outcomes\n\nArticle:\n\nThe investigation into the police shooting of unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has sparked questions about the circumstances surrounding the incident. Attorney William Yeomans, who worked as an attorney and senior official in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division for 24 years, has stated that convicting a police officer of wrongful death is a rare occurrence.\n\nAs Michael Brown was laid to rest on Monday, the shooting that took place two weeks ago remains a contentious issue. Was Brown unjustifiably gunned down by white police officer Darren Wilson, as some contend? Or did Wilson, who reportedly sustained a facial injury during an altercation with Brown, act appropriately in the heat of a confrontation in which Brown reportedly reached for the officer's gun?\n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. traveled to Ferguson to coordinate a Justice Department investigation into the shooting, which was already being probed by local and state law enforcement agencies. Holder's presence instilled confidence in many that justice will be served. However, for some, especially long-aggrieved minority communities with a history of uneasy and often violent relationships with police, justice will only be achieved with Wilson's conviction.\n\nThe history of criminal investigations of police shootings demonstrates the rarity of convictions. While hard numbers are difficult to come by, it is known that police shoot hundreds of people each year, and there are at most a handful of successful criminal charges. Factors such as the trust and dependence on police officers, the backgrounds of the participants, and the difficulty of relying on eyewitness testimony contribute to this rarity.\n\nThe role of police officers as protectors of the public and the power with which we cloak them creates the potential for abuse. This requires that we impose and enforce limits on their use of force, but cautions against punishing them too quickly for mistakes. Legal standards and the willingness of juries to find officers criminally culpable and send them to jail are shaped by this recognition of the role of police officers.\n\nThe backgrounds of the participants in police shootings can color the investigation, grand jury process, and trial. Use of force by police officers is likely to occur in confrontations with individuals who are suspected of criminal wrongdoing. Officers are entitled to use reasonably necessary force in such situations, and the question becomes whether they have exceeded that limit. This dynamic can influence the investigation, grand jury process, and trial, with the tendency to give the benefit of the doubt to the police officer.\n\nEyewitness testimony can be difficult to rely on in police shooting cases due to the chaotic nature of the incidents and the trauma experienced by witnesses. In contests of credibility between police officers and friends or associates of the victim, investigators and juries often favor the police. Successful prosecutions often turn on a rare combination of extensive forensic evidence and the cooperation, however reluctant, of officers.\n\nVideo of the incident can be crucial. For example, in the prosecution of officers who beat Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1991, the federal conviction depended heavily on the ability to parse the individual blows shown in the video taken by a bystander to determine whether officers had exceeded the amount of force necessary to subdue King. The events in Ferguson have generated renewed calls for requiring officers to video confrontations, both as a means of protecting officers from false allegations of excessive force and to preserve the record in those instances that raise legitimate concerns.",
    " Title: US Senate Adopts Ground Rules for Trump's Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has adopted ground rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial following a contentious 13-hour debate on the first day of proceedings. The trial will resume on Wednesday with arguments from the prosecution, followed by the defense and questions from senators.\n\nPresident Trump is the third U.S. president to face an impeachment trial. He is charged with abuse of power and obstructing the congressional impeachment inquiry. Trump has denied wrongdoing and accused Democrats of trying to unseat him for political reasons.\n\nThe trial is taking place after Trump was impeached last month by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. However, the Senate, which is controlled by his fellow Republicans, is not expected to convict and remove him from office.\n\nTrump is currently attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he dismissed the accusations against him as \"a total hoax.\" On the question of whether new witnesses would be called to the trial, Trump said he would leave that to senators to decide, but the White House has actively worked to block the appearance of certain officials.\n\nDemocrats have made it clear they wish to hear testimony from the former National Security Adviser, John Bolton. The Trump administration has said evidence from Mr. Bolton would pose a national security threat - a claim dismissed by Democrats as a smokescreen.\n\nSenators have taken oaths to act as impartial jurors in a trial presided over by US Chief Justice John Roberts. House Democrats known as \"impeachment managers\" act as the prosecution, while Trump's legal team acts as the defense.\n\nUnder the rules approved by the Republican majority, each side will be given up to 24 hours to lay out their case in opening arguments, over three days. Senators are barred from live tweeting and from speaking to those sitting near them while the case is being heard. No outside reading materials are allowed to be brought in.\n\nOpening arguments will begin on Wednesday afternoon. After this finishes, probably early next week, senators will have a chance to ask questions. They have been given 16 hours. Then attention will return again to the key issue of new witnesses and evidence.\n\nDemocrats want to hear from key White House aides who worked closely with Trump, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton. Republicans have so far blocked their attempts.\n\nBy party-line votes of 53-47, the Senate rejected a series of Democratic bids to obtain documents and evidence in the impeachment trial. Senators blocked a motion from Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to subpoena White House files related to Trump's dealings with Ukraine. They also rejected follow-up motions demanding a subpoena of records and documents from the state department and White House budget office. Republican Senators turned back an effort by Democrats to subpoena John Bolton, who has said he would comply with any such order.\n\nIn his opening statement, Adam Schiff, the House Democrat leading the impeachment case, said most Americans \"do not believe there will be a fair trial.\"\n\n\"They do not believe the Senate will be impartial,\" he said. \"They believe the result is pre-cooked.\"\n\nThe president's legal team had earlier demanded he be immediately acquitted, calling the trial \"a dangerous perversion of the constitution.\" At one point during bitter arguments, Justice Roberts admonished both the House prosecutors and the Trump legal team, asking them to remember that they were \"addressing the world's greatest deliberative body.\"\n\nBacked by the president's lawyers, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had initially planned to condense the opening arguments from three days to two. Democrats said this would have been no less than a cover-up. But after a meeting with senators, including some Republicans, McConnell agreed on Tuesday to three days for opening arguments.\n\nThe senators had expressed concern about how middle-of-the-night sessions would look to US voters. But White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, the president's lead lawyer, had called the plan \"a fair process.\" Several more days of procedural tangles are expected.\n\nThe president is accused of seeking help from Ukraine's government to help himself get re-elected in November. It is claimed that, during a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he held back military aid as he sought an anti-corruption investigation into Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden, whose son, Hunter, held a board position with a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma.\n\nThe second allegation is that, by refusing to allow White House staff to testify at the impeachment hearings last year, Mr. Trump obstructed Congress. The Senate is hearing the case as the Democratic-led House voted to impeach Mr. Trump on 18 December.\n\nWhat questions do you have about Donald Trump's impeachment trial?",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Faces Internal Strife as Election Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nRegent University's Dr. Gerson Moreno-Riano has stated that the Trump campaign is currently facing internal strife, and the coming days will reveal whether the candidate can unite not only his inner circle but also the Republican Party. Moreno-Riano discussed Trump's challenges with Evangelicals in a recent interview.\n\nOn Monday, Trump dismissed campaign manager Corey Lewandowski amid reports of disagreements and internal conflict within the campaign staff. \"I think what's happened with the Trump campaign is, I think it's fractured itself internally,\" Moreno-Riano said. \"I think that it is trying to meet a number of different objectives and keep a number of constituencies very, very happy and it has been unable to do so.\"\n\nMoreno-Riano added that this internal discord is indicative of a broader, deeper problem within the American electorate, particularly among GOP evangelicals. \"The dilemma has always been whether Trump himself has what I'll call the internal character-based resources to pull this off,\" he explained. \"He is a man who is very direct, very strong-minded, and the question is: Does he have enough discipline, both personally and professionally, enough political discipline to pull this off? I think at the end of the day, it's his question to answer.\"\n\nThe decision to fire his campaign manager comes just one day before Trump is set to meet with hundreds of evangelical leaders in New York City to address their concerns about his conservative and Christian bona fides. Moreno-Riano identified abortion, religious liberty, and the Supreme Court as some of the most important issues Trump can address in the meeting, including the question, \"Are you truly someone who understands the evangelical mindset\u2014those areas of deep concern?\"\n\nMoreno-Riano expressed doubt about Trump's ability to unite evangelicals, stating, \"They need to 'bring unity to the table,' and I just don't see that.\" He added, \"Since the 1950s, evangelicals have failed to rally around any candidate, and that's too big a burden to place on Trump. I think they're going to try to assess whether he's truly evangelical or not, so it's a big challenge for him to try and unite them around a common denominator. That's going to be difficult.\"",
    " Title: Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval Declines Possible U.S. Supreme Court Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval announced on Thursday that he is declining a possible nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court. In a statement, Sandoval said, \"I have notified the White House that I do not wish to be considered at this time for possible nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\nThe White House declined to comment on whether Sandoval was ever seriously considered for the nomination. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated, \"Even after the fact, I\u2019m not going to get into a lot of details about who's on the president's list and who is not.\"\n\nSenior U.S. Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, recommended Sandoval for President Barack Obama's consideration in filling a vacant seat on the Supreme Court. News of Sandoval's vetting for the nomination leaked to the public on Wednesday.\n\nSandoval's nomination was seen by many as unlikely, with his moderate Republican stance potentially used to pressure Republicans into considering a nominee from their own party. Since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this month, Republican leaders in the Senate have vowed to block any of the president's proposed replacements.\n\nRichardson, a professor of sociology and judicial studies at the University of Nevada, Reno, stated, \"I really do think it was a serious idea for him to be considered.\" However, he also sees why Sandoval would withdraw his name from consideration once it leaked. \"I can understand why the governor wouldn\u2019t want to get caught up in that,\" Richardson said. \"I think, in the future, his name will be brought up again. He\u2019s a moderate Republican. They\u2019re thin on the ground these days.\"\n\nSandoval is not a typical Republican, as he does not actively oppose gay marriage or abortion, and he recently pushed through the largest tax increase in Nevada history. Nevada's Republican Senator Dean Heller supports Sandoval's decision to withdraw from Supreme Court consideration but views him as a legitimate candidate. Heller stated, \"I hope the next president will consider him in the future.\"\n\nHistorically, the chances of a Supreme Court nominee being appointed have been slim. Since 1956, 21 justices have been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and they share similar backgrounds, according to The Supreme Court Historical Society. Two-thirds of Supreme Court justices attended either Harvard or Yale law schools, with a few earning their law degrees at Northwestern or Stanford universities. Columbia University, Howard University, and the St. Paul College of Law made isolated appearances. Of the eight members currently serving on the Supreme Court, four earned their law degrees at Harvard, three went to Yale, and one attended Columbia. Sandoval earned his degree at Ohio State University Moritz College of Law in 1989.",
    " Title: South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham Embraces Immigration Reform, Faces No Immediate Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that may seem counterintuitive, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is up for reelection and considered vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right, has endorsed a plan to allow illegal immigrants to gain U.S. citizenship. This controversial stance, often a lightning rod for GOP primary voters, has not yet sparked a backlash in his home state, South Carolina.\n\nThe move reflects both Senator Graham's political strength and the rapid evolution of the Republican Party's stance on immigration since the party's November election losses among Latinos. Historically viewed with suspicion by the right wing, Graham's 2007 endorsement of the Kennedy-McCain immigration reform bill was met with skepticism. However, the senator appears to feel secure heading into 2014, taking a politically risky stance on a deeply contentious issue he is passionate about.\n\nImmediately following the November election, Graham reached out to Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to discuss a bipartisan deal on immigration, a topic few Republicans have been willing to engage with in recent years. In 2007, Graham faced boos at town halls for supporting reform, and his proposal was labeled \"Grahamnesty\" by conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh.\n\n\"There are going to be people who are upset,\" Graham told a media outlet last week. \"I do believe that people in the Republican Party are beginning to understand the politics of immigration. But people do want the borders secured; they want to get this issue behind us; and I think I'm in a good spot to go back home and tell people that now is the time to get this done.\"\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, a fellow member of the Gang of Eight, provides Senator Graham some political cover on his right flank. The 2012 electoral defeat, partly driven by Mitt Romney's 27% showing with Hispanics, has led many Republicans to reconsider their opposition to a comprehensive immigration overhaul.\n\nRandy Page, chairman of the GOP committee in South Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, is one such Republican. He voted last summer to include tough language in the GOP national platform as South Carolina's representative on the committee that drafted its contents.\n\n\"A number of us, myself included, have looked at the message that the Republican Party has been sending and looking at the message that the Hispanic community sent us in November, and we've started to listen to what Sen. Rubio and Sen. Graham have been saying,\" Page said.\n\n\"Looking specifically at Hispanics, most of them support us on other issues\u2014whether social issues or fiscal issues\u2014but yet we're saying, 'You're not welcome.' And we want you to go back and self-deport yourself'? That's the wrong rhetoric, and it's, frankly, the wrong solution.\"\n\nThe developments in South Carolina mirror changes in conservative thought leaders' stances on immigration reform nationally. Television host Sean Hannity, columnist Charles Krauthammer, and others have announced changes in their hearts on immigration reform since the election.",

The gunman, identified as Jarrod W. Ramos, a 38-year-old Laurel resident, allegedly targeted the newspaper, killing five employees and wounding two others.\n\nThe victims were identified as Wendi Winters, special publications editor; Rob Hiaasen, editor and Sunday columnist; John McNamara, writer; Gerald Fischman, editorial page editor; and Rebecca Smith, sales assistant. The gunman, who entered the building looking for specific people, was taken into custody without exchanging fire.\n\nThe shooting was described as a \"targeted attack\" by police, who stated that the gunman had sent threats to the newspaper on social media. Former Capital Gazette publisher and editor Tom Marquardt had previously expressed concerns about Ramos, stating, \"I remember telling our attorneys, 'This is a guy who is going to come in and shoot us.'\"\n\nRamos unsuccessfully filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper in 2012 over coverage of a criminal harassment case against him. The Baltimore Sun, which owns the Capital Gazette, and other news outlets reported similarly.\n\nThe Capital Gazette's staff took to Twitter to share details of the assault, describing the gunman as shooting through the glass doors to the office and opening fire on employees. Reporter Phil Davis tweeted, \"There is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you're under your desk and then hear the gunman reload.\"\n\nAuthorities said it took only about a minute to respond to the shooting and evacuated about 170 people from the building. Two others were injured, possibly by glass shattering from gunshot blasts. The Anne Arundel Medical Center confirmed two patients were brought there from the shooting, with only minor injuries, not caused by gunfire.\n\nThe shooting prompted wild speculation from some individuals who blamed President Trump for creating an environment that allegedly fueled the shooting. However, no direct link between the president and the shooting has been established.\n\nThe Capital Gazette, a 30,000-circulation daily, has offices in a building on the outskirts of downtown Annapolis. It shares the building with other professional offices, and people in those offices described a harrowing ordeal.\n\nThe shooting has left the community in shock, with many expressing their condolences and praising the bravery of the first responders. Defiant survivors of the attack vowed to continue their work, with reporter Chase Cook tweeting, \"I can tell you this: We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow.\"",
    " Title: Stormy Daniels Expands Lawsuit Against President Trump, Alleges Defamation by Michael Cohen\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a legal escalation on Monday, adult film actress Stormy Daniels broadened her lawsuit against President Donald Trump, adding his lawyer Michael Cohen as a defendant. The move comes a day after Daniels' widely viewed 60 Minutes interview in which she provided detailed accounts of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump and claimed she was physically threatened to keep quiet about the president.\n\nThe new filing argues that a $130,000 payment for her silence, made days before the 2016 election, constituted an illegal campaign contribution. The defamation claim centers on a statement Cohen made in February, explaining why he arranged the payment. In the statement, Cohen said he used his own money to \"facilitate\" the payoff and stated that Trump was not aware of his actions at the time.\n\nIn her new filings, Daniels contends that Cohen's statement implied she was lying about the affair and exposed her to \"hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame.\" The White House, in response, denied any campaign-finance law violations in the payment to Daniels and cast doubts on her claim of physical threats.\n\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters that the president does not believe Daniels' claims made in the 60 Minutes interview and that there is no corroborating evidence. Trump himself has been uncharacteristically silent about Daniels, even after she revealed unflattering details about their alleged encounter on national television.\n\nDaniels' updated lawsuit and Shah's remarks from the White House briefing room mark the latest twist in a legal saga that has drawn comparisons to New York tabloid stories. Daniels and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, are actively working to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with Trump's lawyer.\n\nCohen, a former top attorney for the Trump Organization, is also fighting back. Cohen's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to Avenatti after the interview aired, demanding that Daniels retract \"false and defamatory\" claims she made to 60 Minutes.\n\nIn the CBS interview, Daniels described agreeing to keep silent about the alleged 2006 sexual relationship with Trump in exchange for a $130,000 payment arranged by Cohen, fearing for her safety. Daniels attributed these fears to a 2011 encounter with an unidentified man who threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot after she first tried to sell her story to a tabloid magazine.\n\nAsked about Daniels' payment to stay quiet before the election if the affair did not happen, Shah said, \"False charges are settled out of court all the time, and this is nothing outside the ordinary.\" Watchdog groups have filed complaints arguing that the payment likely violated campaign-finance laws.",
    " Title: U.S. Accelerates Efforts to Decouple Supply Chain from China Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is accelerating an initiative aimed at reducing the United States' reliance on a China-based supply chain and is considering imposing new tariffs as a response to China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report published on Monday.\n\nThe economic impact and death toll from the COVID-19 outbreak have prompted a government-wide plan to shift the supply chain from China, an extension of President Trump's pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.\n\nKeith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment at the State Department, told Reuters, \"We've been working on [reducing the reliance of our supply chains in China] over the last few years, but we are now turbocharging that initiative.\"\n\nKrach stated, \"I think it is essential to understand where the critical areas are and where critical bottlenecks exist.\" He added that the government could announce new action soon.\n\nA number of agencies, including the Commerce and State departments, are examining how to move the supply chain and manufacturing from China using tax incentives and other measures, the report said. They are also evaluating which manufacturing work should be considered \"essential\" and how to produce those goods outside of China.\n\n\"There is a whole-of-government push on this,\" an official told Reuters. \"The White House's policy on China has always been caught between pro-trade advisers and China hawks, but the current situation has given the hard-liners new ammunition.\"\n\nA senior U.S. official said, \"This moment is a perfect storm; the pandemic has crystallized all the worries that people have had about doing business with China.\"\n\nThe official continued, \"All the money that people think they made by making deals with China before, now they've been eclipsed many fold by the economic damage from the pandemic.\"\n\nPresident Trump has discussed adding new tariffs on top of the 25 percent levies on $370 billion in Chinese goods already in place. The administration is also considering imposing sanctions on Chinese officials or companies and developing closer relations with Taiwan, which China considers a rogue province.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said late last month that the administration is working with Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Vietnam to \"move the global economy forward.\" He stated that the talks include how to restructure supply chains \"to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\"\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted China's critical role in the supply chain for generic drugs in the U.S., as well as medical equipment and food supplies. However, many U.S. companies have heavily invested in China and rely on the country's 1.4 billion people for sales.\n\nDoug Barry, spokesman for the U.S.-China Business Council, told Reuters, \"Diversification and some redundancy in supply chains will make sense given the level of risk that the pandemic has uncovered, but we don't see a wholesale rush for the exits by companies doing business in China.\"\n\nJohn Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said building new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. could take up to eight years.\n\n\"We're concerned that officials need to get the right fact sets before they start looking at alternatives,\" he said.",
    " Title: Media Outlets Dispute Romney's Characterization of Obama's Foreign Policy Speeches as an \"Apology Tour\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the third presidential debate, political commentator Charles Krauthammer, on the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel, praised Mitt Romney for his assertion that President Barack Obama embarked on an \"apology tour\" during his first term. However, mainstream media outlets have disputed this characterization, claiming that Obama did not use the word \"apologize\" in his foreign policy speeches.\n\nDuring the debate, Obama contested Romney's claim, stating that fact-checkers and reporters have found no evidence to support the \"apology tour\" characterization. The Dictionary.com definition of apology as \"a written or spoken expression of one's regret, remorse, or sorrow for having insulted, failed, injured, or wronged another\" has been used to support Romney's claim, with Krauthammer dismissing the journalists' defense as \"about as weak an answer you can get.\"\n\nABC and CNN have spoken out in defense of the President. ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos questioned if there were any \"glaring misstatements\" by either candidate, with Jonathan Karl zeroing in on Romney's claim that Obama went on an \"apology tour\" when he became President. Karl maintained that Obama did not apologize for America, despite acknowledging past mistakes in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nCNN outright labeled the characterization as \"False,\" with anchor John Berman asserting that Obama never used the word \"apology\" or said he was sorry in any of his speeches. Berman also refused to acknowledge that Obama's critical comments about past U.S. foreign policy constituted an apology.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, however, has compiled a list of instances where Obama has chastised past U.S. foreign policy, including a speech in France where Obama stated that \"at times we sought to dictate our terms\" and an op-ed about policy toward the Americas where Obama declared that \"Too often, the United States has not pursued and sustained engagement with our neighbors.\"\n\nOther examples include Obama's rationalization that \"The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history\" while speaking to the Turkish parliament, his urging of CIA employees to acknowledge \"potentially we've made some mistakes\" in an administration report about enhanced interrogation techniques, and his denunciation of techniques used in the war on terror and his apology for the establishment and operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nWith the election approaching, it appears that the press corps will continue to scrutinize both candidates' statements and fact-check their claims, potentially affecting the outcome in swing states.

Hickox, who recently returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, expressed her opposition to the quarantine, stating, \"I am not willing to stand here and have my civil rights violated.\"\n\nDuring a press conference earlier today, Maine Health Commissioner Mary Mayhew stated, \"When it is made clear by an individual in this risk category that they do not intend to voluntarily stay at home for the remaining 21 days, we will immediately seek a court order to ensure that they do not make contact with the public.\" However, legal experts question whether such an order would be approved by a judge.\n\nPublic health lawyer Wendy Mariner, who teaches at Boston University School of Law, stated, \"The state has the burden of proving that she is infected, or at least was credibly exposed to infection, and also that by her own behavior she is likely to infect others if not confined. The state is not likely to have any evidence of that.\" Mariner added that Hickox should be able to prove that she is not infected and plans to take precautions to not expose anyone to her bodily fluids.\n\nEarlier today, Maine's governor and other officials stated they were seeking legal authority to enforce what started out as a voluntary quarantine. They also stated that state police were monitoring Hickox's home \"for both her protection and the health of the community.\"\n\nKaci Hickox, 33, was treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone for Doctors Without Borders. She returned to the United States on Friday, landing in Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where she was questioned and quarantined in an outdoor tent despite having no symptoms. Hickox registered a fever on an infrared thermometer at the airport but an oral thermometer at University Hospital in Newark showed that she actually had no fever, she said.\n\nAfter twice testing negative for the deadly virus, Hickox was released and returned home to Maine on Monday. The following day, the state's health commissioner announced that Maine would join the handful of states going beyond federal guidelines and asking that returning Ebola health workers self-quarantine.\n\n\"Our true desire is for a voluntary separation from the public,\" Main Health Commissioner Mary Mayhew said in a statement. \"We do not want to have to legally enforce an in-home quarantine. We are confident that the selfless health workers, who were brave enough to care for Ebola patients in a foreign country, will be willing to take reasonable steps to protect the residents of their own country. However, we are willing to pursue legal authority if necessary to ensure risk is minimized for Mainers.\"\n\nKaci Hickox told \"Good Morning America\" today via Skype from her hometown of Fort Kent, \"I will go to court to attain my freedom. I have been completely asymptomatic since I've been here. I feel absolutely great.\"\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not consider health workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa to be at \"high risk\" for catching Ebola if they were wearing protective gear, according to new guidelines announced this week. Since they have \"some risk,\" the CDC recommends that they undergo monitoring, avoid public transportation, and take other precautions. However, the CDC does not require home quarantines for these workers.\n\nSomeone is not contagious until Ebola symptoms appear, according to the CDC. And even then, transmission requires contact with bodily fluids such as blood and vomit.",
    " Title: North Korea Cuts Military Hotlines, Escalates Propaganda War Against U.S. and South Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has severed its last military hotlines with South Korea and increased its rhetoric, causing concern in the region. Thousands of North Koreans rallied in central Pyongyang, chanting \"Death to the U.S. imperialists.\" Their leader, Kim Jong Un, has called for \"scores to be settled\" with the U.S.\n\nThis is the latest phase in a propaganda war. Pyongyang also released a video depicting an invasion of Seoul, with North Korean forces flying across the border to destroy American bases in South Korea. The video also shows the cancellation of the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War. However, experts are skeptical about North Korea's threats to attack American bases in Guam, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.\n\nKim Heung-kyu, a professor at Sungshin Women's University in Seoul and an adviser to South Korea's last president, Lee Myung-bak, states, \"I do not think they are capable of launching this type of attack against the United States.\" He anticipates North Korea's provocations to be against South Korea, involving cyberwarfare and targeting military areas or certain scientific facilities.\n\nSouth Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, continues to discuss \"trustpolitik,\" aiming to re-establish trust while taking a tough line with the North. Pyongyang is attempting to pressure her to soften her policies and secure direct talks from Washington.\n\nWith communication links severed, the biggest danger is miscalculation, according to John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul. \"Both countries are essentially on a kind of war footing. In the South, there's expectation that some provocation could be coming soon, and there's no one on the end of the [hotline] to answer, to clarify,\" he says. \"South Koreans are finger-on-the-trigger ready to do something. That's why it's so dangerous to have no channel whatsoever between the two countries right now.\"\n\nNorth Korea has antagonized China, its traditional ally, with its rocket launch and third nuclear test. Peking University's Jia Qingguo states that China's position is much tougher than before, and China is on board for stiffer U.N. sanctions against its old ally. \"I think this is a turning point. North Korea has decided to pursue what it believes to be its best interests at the expense of the interest of other countries, including China,\" Jia says. \"I think China has put up with it for a long time, and enough is enough.\"\n\nHowever, Beijing's prime concern is still stability, making it unlikely to abandon Pyongyang at the moment. The propaganda war continues, with the escalating threats and massive rallies leaving Pyongyang little room for maneuver. One thing is clear: The new young leader, Kim Jong Un, has learned from his father's playbook and may yet prove to be more unpredictable.",
    " Title: Cruz Wins Iowa Republican Caucus; Clinton and Sanders Tied in Democratic Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Senator Ted Cruz emerged victorious in the Iowa caucus on Monday, securing 28 percent of the vote, while businessman Donald Trump followed closely behind with 24 percent. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, came in third with 23 percent, positioning himself as the leading establishment candidate.\n\nIn the Democratic contest, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, were neck and neck, with each candidate receiving approximately 50 percent of the vote with 95 percent of precincts reporting results. Sanders declared the results a tie. Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, who struggled to gain traction in the Democratic race, suspended his campaign, taking third place with less than one percent.\n\nCruz's win and Rubio's strong showing may impact Trump's momentum, as his candidacy has been marked by controversies such as his calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. In his victory speech, Cruz, 45, thanked God and expressed gratitude to evangelical voters. Trump, 69, congratulated Cruz and looked forward to the next contest in New Hampshire, where polls show him ahead.\n\nClinton, 68, said she was relieved after the results, having lost to then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008. Sanders, 74, said he and Clinton were in a \"virtual tie\" and expressed gratitude for the support of Iowans. The results could shift momentum in both races, with Clinton aiming for a strong finish against Sanders to quell his insurgent campaign and Sanders leading in opinion polls in New Hampshire.\n\nRubio's third-place finish established him as the Republican mainstream alternative to Trump and Cruz. \"I am grateful to you, Iowa. You believed in me when others did not think it was possible,\" Rubio, 44, said.\n\nThe Iowa caucus, held since the early 1970s, gives the state extra weight in the U.S. electoral process, translating into momentum for winning candidates. The caucuses are voter gatherings that take place in 1,100 schools, churches, and other public locations across the Midwestern state.\n\nThe 2016 election is shaping up to be the year of angry voters, as disgruntled Americans worry about issues such as immigration, terrorism, income inequality, and healthcare, fueling the campaigns of Trump, Sanders, and Cruz. Financial markets showed a muted response to the results, with U.S. stock futures down around half a percent.",
    " Title: Federal Government's Potential Missed Opportunity to Profit from Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nArticle:\n\nThe federal Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has 78.5 million barrels of spare capacity available, as of April 10, according to the most recent data. This spare capacity could have potentially generated a significant profit for the government by taking advantage of the current and future prices of U.S. crude oil.\n\nHad the federal government acted last week, it could have purchased 78.5 million barrels of crude oil for the SPR at Friday's price of $18.27 on the New York Mercantile Exchange and simultaneously agreed to deliver that same amount of oil in December at $33.82. This difference of $15.55 per barrel would have resulted in a potential profit of $1.22 billion for the government. Given the current plunge in oil prices, the profit would be approximately half a billion dollars higher.\n\nHowever, the government did not take advantage of this opportunity due to several reasons. First, the idea of arbitraging oil by simultaneously buying and selling it is not a common practice for the federal government. Second, the Energy Department did not receive the funds from Congress to buy oil for the SPR in the last stimulus package, and it is unclear if the SPR has the authority to sell oil in the futures market.\n\nThe Trump administration has, however, ordered the SPR to store 23 million barrels of oil for hard-pressed oil companies. This reduces the SPR's spare capacity to 55.5 million barrels, resulting in a potential profit of $863 million, based on the same $15.55 per barrel spread. The Energy Department declined to disclose the storage fee or the duration for which the oil will be stored.\n\nThe oil companies depositing the oil and then getting most of it back will likely turn a profit that could have otherwise gone to the taxpayers. This is because June oil futures were selling for 34% more than the then-current price, July futures were 57% higher, and the numbers kept climbing. This spread is likely more than the rent rate that the SPR will charge.\n\nWhile some may oppose anything that helps increase oil production, the potential profit from the SPR's spare storage capacity is likely to go to oil companies if no action is taken quickly by President Trump, Congress, or both. The government could have profited from the SPR, which was established at taxpayer expense, rather than oil companies profiting from it. The potential profit of $1.22 billion, or even $2 billion, is significant compared to the looming budget deficits.",
    " Title: Intense Fighting Erupts at Iraq-Syria Border as Kurdish Forces Battle Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nHeavy fighting has been reported at a key border crossing between Iraq and Syria, where Kurdish forces are engaged in combat with Islamic State (IS) militants. Iraqi Kurdish troops are said to have recaptured the town of Rabia, but suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile, IS fighters are attempting to dislodge Syrian Kurdish forces on the other side of the border.\n\nThe recapture of Rabia by Iraqi Kurdish troops, according to reports, was aided by two British Tornado jet air strikes, as per information from Kurdish sources. The strikes reportedly helped the Kurds retake an \"important border crossing\" at Rabia, as stated by the BBC's Clive Myrie in Irbil, northern Iraq.\n\nIn Syria, US warplanes conducted 11 air strikes over the last two days, targeting IS positions near Deir al-Zour, Sinjar, Mazra al-Duwud, and Aleppo. These strikes destroyed a number of armed vehicles, artillery pieces, and one tank.\n\nIn Iraq, 11 US raids on Tuesday in the north-west, near the Mosul Dam and Baghdad, destroyed IS armoured and transport vehicles and a checkpoint.\n\nViolence has also claimed lives in Iraq, with at least 20 people killed in bomb attacks on Shia areas of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, and similar attacks in the holy Shia city of Karbala.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, stated that 11 million people inside Syria require urgent aid. She warned that without additional funding, the World Food Programme will be forced to end its operations completely within two months.\n\nIn a separate development, Turkish tanks have taken up positions along the border near the Syrian town of Kobane after several shells hit Turkish territory during clashes between IS and Kurdish fighters. The Turkish government has requested parliamentary authorization for military action against IS in Iraq and Syria, and MPs are expected to discuss the issue on Thursday.\n\nSenior Iraqi Kurdish officials reported that their Peshmerga special forces made significant progress during their dawn offensive in Rabia. By nightfall, Rabia was said to be firmly in Kurdish control, although IS militants continued to hold out in just one building.\n\nRabia is approximately 100km (60 miles) north-west of Mosul, the biggest city controlled by IS. However, the Iraqi Kurdish forces also took heavy casualties, including the loss of a senior commander, when three suicide car bombers detonated themselves among the Kurdish troops. The bombers are believed to have travelled from IS-controlled areas further east.\n\nControl of the Rabia crossing and cutting IS supply lines are seen as important steps towards an eventual move to regain the town of Sinjar and its nearby mountain. Militants overran that area in August, forcing tens of thousands of civilians from the minority Yazidi community to flee for their lives.\n\nThe other side of the border is controlled by Syrian Kurdish fighters, who themselves have been coming under attacks from IS. More than 30 Syrian Kurdish fighters are reported to have been killed as the jihadists took over several villages south of the border crossing. However, the crossing itself is said to be still under Kurdish control.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Aims to Encourage Party Unity Ahead of Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the Democratic National Convention, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is set to meet privately with his supporters on Monday to address concerns over the nominating process, party platform, and party leadership. Some Sanders backers have expressed frustration and have suggested they may protest or take action on the convention floor.\n\nSanders, who endorsed Hillary Clinton two weeks ago after a long-fought primary, has sought to find common ground around the party platform and rules. He successfully won major platform concessions, including a $15 federal minimum wage, abolishing the death penalty, and breaking up large Wall Street banks.\n\nAt a meeting of the DNC credentials committee on Sunday, comments praising party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz were met with laughter by some Sanders supporters. At a committee meeting the previous day, Sanders backers shouted \"shame, shame, shame\" as amendments to abolish or limit superdelegates in future nominating competitions were voted down.\n\nSome Sanders delegates feel the Clinton campaign is not taking their policy concerns seriously. At a news conference on Sunday, Sanders delegate Norman Solomon, 65, of Point Reyes Station, California, said many of Sanders' liberal supporters were disappointed in Clinton's vice presidential pick of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. He said most viewed Kaine as not progressive enough, and there had been discussion about a variety of protest actions at the convention, including walking out.\n\nHowever, Sanders delegate Courtney Rowe, 34, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said \"we are not here to disrupt for the purpose of disruption.\" She said she was not currently planning on any action and wanted to hear from Sanders.\n\nSanders has made clear that he would like to see a full roll call vote at the convention, so that his delegates can show their support. After the unity commission agreement, Sanders supporters seeking to pass amendments to abolish or curtail superdelegates opted against pursuing convention floor fights on the issue.",
    " Title: GOP's Lack of Consensus on Healthcare Reform: A Look at the Challenges and Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nFor over three years, the Republican party has been embroiled in a contentious debate over the appropriate response to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with some advocating for its repeal and replacement, while others favor repeal without a clear replacement plan. In practice, the latter position has been the Republicans' actual stance, as they have repeatedly voted to repeal the law but have yet to reach a consensus on a single replacement plan.\n\nDuring the lead-up to the ACA's implementation, this lack of a coherent replacement strategy has been a liability for the Republicans, damaging their credibility as critics of healthcare reform with the press and the public alike. The argument that the old system was flawed and should be reverted to might seem compelling under the troubled ACA rollout, but the Republicans find themselves in a unique position of relief rather than regret.\n\nThe relief stems from the fact that a replacement plan would neutralize one of their most effective, yet disingenuous, lines of attack against the ACA. The outrage expressed by Republicans over cancellation notices for individual market insurance plans is seen as insincere because their primary interest in addressing this issue is through the repeal or destruction of the ACA.\n\nMoreover, the most revealing aspect of the Republicans' position, as identified by The New Republic's Jonathan Cohn, is that almost all GOP healthcare plans would disrupt the insurance market more dramatically than the ACA does. The Republicans' inability to reach a consensus on a replacement plan for Obamacare indicates a general agreement that very few people should be allowed to keep their current insurance plans.\n\nJonathan Cohn explains that almost all GOP plans would result in the disruption of millions of people's Medicaid coverage and would create a significant incentive for healthy workers to abandon their employer-sponsored insurance plans for individual ones, leading to a death spiral in the employer-sponsored insurance market. This would result in more cancellation notices and \"rate shock\" than currently observed, but without the safety net of the ACA's exchanges to cushion the impact.\n\nThe National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru's solution to this problem is to phase out the ACA's disruptions gradually. While the ACA creates an immediate disruption for a relatively small group of individual policyholders, Republicans should create a slow, steady disruption for tens of millions more.\n\nOther conservative policy wonks propose replacing all insurance with subsidized catastrophic coverage and tax-preferred health savings accounts. Under this plan, no one with private insurance or Medicaid would be able to keep their current coverage, regardless of how much they value it.\n\nAnother aspect of the Republicans' healthcare reform plans is the elimination of traditional Medicare for future retirees and its replacement with a plan that resembles the ACA. The sales pitch version of the plan is that Republicans aim to keep the promise made to current retirees and those nearing retirement, but to radically overhaul the system for the young and middle-aged. Over time, single-payer Medicare would be phased out.\n\nHowever, as nearly every healthcare expert will tell you, the phase-out would be massively disruptive. As the program's beneficiaries aged and dwindled in number, it would become unsustainable very quickly. Without scale, the government would lose its purchasing power, and would either have to fork over substantial amounts of money to motivate providers to care for beneficiaries \u2013 a bailout \u2013 or watch providers abandon the program en masse, leaving the country's oldest, sickest people with little choice but to enter the private insurance market.\n\nThe Republicans' portrayal of President Obama's \"if you like your plan, you can keep it\" promise as the noble lie from which all of the ACA's apocalyptic consequences will ultimately spring is a focus of their criticism. However, the deception they hope to perpetrate against seniors, by promising to maintain traditional Medicare while gradually phasing it out, is far more egregious.\n\nIf a consensus GOP plan were to materialize today, the Republicans would have to reconcile their expressed sympathy for young policyholders facing cancellation notices with the radical nature of their own vision. It is unclear how they would address the consequences of their plan without being forthright about them. The truth is, such a plan would likely fail on the House floor due to its radical nature. Given the disruption it would cause, it is doubtful that there will ever be a political constituency for it, even if the Republicans regain control of the government.",
    " Title: House Remains Republican Likely in 2014 Midterm Elections, According to Analysts\n\n Article:\n\n In the upcoming 2014 midterm elections, the House of Representatives is expected to remain under Republican control, according to political analysts. The current composition of the House is 233 Republicans, 200 Democrats, and two vacancies. Upcoming special elections to fill the vacancies in Alabama and Massachusetts will likely result in one seat for each party.\n\n Democratic strategists have identified 17 Republican-held seats they are targeting, including districts carried by President Barack Obama in the 2012 election. Victories in all 17 districts by Democratic candidates would result in a Democratic majority in the House, with 218 seats to 217 for the Republicans. However, this strategy depends on Democrats winning every targeted seat and Republicans picking up no seats.\n\n On the other hand, Republicans are expected to target the nine districts that went for Mitt Romney for president but sent a Democrat to the House. These include the two closest races in the nation last year: North Carolina's 7th District and Arizona's 2nd, in which Republicans David Rouzer and Martha McSally will square off in rematches with Democratic Reps. Mike McIntyre and Ron Barber, respectively.\n\n The most vulnerable Democratic-held district in the nation is Florida's 18th District, where 30-year-old Democrat Patrick Murphy edged out conservative Allen West by less than 2,000 votes in 2012. Already, four Republicans have filed for the chance to oppose Murphy in 2014. Murphy's vote against repeal of Obamacare is expected to be a major issue for any Republican opponent.\n\n For open seats, there is typically greater competition and more \"switcheroos\" than attempting to dislodge incumbents. So far, there are 14 seats without incumbents\u2014five Democratic-held seats and nine Republican-held seats. The West Virginia seat that Republican Shelley Moore Capito is leaving to run for the Senate could go Democratic, and the Iowa seat Democrat Bruce Braley is giving up for a Senate run could go the other way. For now, few of the other 12 are likely to flip.\n\n Former Secretary of State James Baker once said, \"Overnight is an eternity in politics.\" Much can change between now and November of 2014. However, at this time, the best prediction is the House remains Republican next year. Just do the math.",
    " Title: Grass-roots Pressure on White House Increases as Immigration Debate Shifts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is facing mounting pressure from grass-roots organizations to take action on the immigration issue, as progressive groups shift their focus from critics of the president's agenda to the White House itself. With the Republican Party controlling the House and election-year jitters, these organizations view the White House as the most viable avenue for progress on immigration.\n\nThe Center for American Progress and National Council of La Raza are the only two progressive immigration organizations that are not demanding President Barack Obama halt deportations himself. Other grassroots groups claim these organizations may be too close to the White House to maintain objectivity.\n\nChris Newman, the legal director of the Los Angeles-based National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), stated, \"There is no doubt that some groups have at times seen administrative advocacy as being in tension with the legislative campaign. We all have our different roles to play, but there is a perception outside of the Washington Beltway that some organizations with access have become apologists for the administration.\"\n\nImmigration groups, who typically work closely together, are reluctant to attack each other publicly. One official from an immigration group that has demanded a stop to deportations said, \"It's access misinterpreted as influence.\"\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) stated that the push to stop deportations is so widespread at the grassroots level that no Washington organization can control it. NDLON, the group most vocal in its demands that Obama act on deportations, was once part of the White House's broad immigration coalition.\n\nAfter NDLON started advocating loudly for Obama to stop deportations, Newman's invitations from and contact with the White House ceased. \"There's been no question that we've lost access,\" Newman said. \"And I would say that \u2013 I don't know if we lost our innocence and we got over our incredulity about promises the Obama administration had made.\"\n\nThe internal debate is centered entirely among progressive immigration organizations. The more dependent a group is on grassroots support, the more likely it is to pressure the White House to take action on deportations. The more a group's influence relies on its access to power, the less likely it is to push back.\n\nConservative and business-focused groups like Mike Bloomberg's Partnership for a New American Economy, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Fwd.us have kept their attention entirely on moving legislation in Congress and have not sought to pressure Obama on deportations.\n\nKica Matos of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement said, \"There are differences of opinion in the movement about how to move forward on reform. But the movement is resolute about one thing: We want reform, and we want it now.\"\n\nThe White House maintains that Obama does not have the authority to act unilaterally on deportations without Congress. The closest the president has come to suggesting otherwise was during a Google Hangout last month when he said he was willing to \"look at all options.\"\n\nSpeaking on Univision radio, Obama urged listeners to call Republicans in Congress and demand they move on immigration. \"I've been pushing and pushing Congress to take action,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has not passed a bill yet. And for it to become law, we need the House of Representatives to pass that bill. The main thing people can do right now is put pressure on Republicans who have refused so far to act.\"",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the History of Aunt Jemima's 'Original' Model, Nancy Green\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of social media posts claiming that Nancy Green, the first model hired to portray Aunt Jemima, was wrongly portrayed in the discontinuation of the Aunt Jemima logo and brand. The posts suggest that Green created the cooking brand, which was later purchased by a larger company, and that she became a millionaire due to her creation. However, the actual history of Nancy Green is less clear, and these claims are largely inaccurate.\n\nThe Aunt Jemima brand was not created by Nancy Green, but rather by Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood, who named their new pancake flour after a minstrel show song titled \"Old Aunt Jemima.\" Green was hired to portray an image that already existed in popular culture: the \"mammy,\" a racist stereotype of an amiable, older, overweight African American woman who served in a domestic role to whites. The logo has changed six times to move away from the mammy stereotype.\n\nPatricia Turner, a professor in UCLA's Department of African American Studies and senior dean of the UCLA College, stated in an interview that it is highly unlikely that Green was extraordinarily wealthy. Turner said, \"I know of no record of what they paid her or what that relationship was like, but we do know that black people were exploited by white businessmen.\" Turner added that it was plausible that Green was paid well enough to be comfortable, but she certainly was not a \"millionaire philanthropist\" as claimed in the viral social media posts.\n\nGiven what is known of Nancy Green's life and the records that exist, social media posts downplaying the racist nature of the Aunt Jemima brand rely on factually incorrect information and fabrications for which there is no record.",
    " Title: Anonymity in Reporting: A Growing Concern in the Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe use of anonymous sources in journalism has been a topic of debate in recent times, particularly in the context of the Trump administration. The media has been under scrutiny for its reliance on unnamed sources, with some accusing it of creating a narrative that portrays the administration in a negative light.\n\nThe Washington Post, The New York Times, and CNN are among the media outlets that have reported on various incidents involving the Trump administration, often citing unnamed sources. These stories have ranged from allegations of incompetence and policy turmoil within the administration to claims of potential conflicts of interest and communications with foreign entities.\n\nCritics argue that the media's use of anonymous sources has led to a sense of national anxiety and hysteria, painting a picture of an administration in chaos and potentially on the brink of crisis. However, the administration's actions, such as the controversial immigration executive order and the alleged lies by National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, have also raised concerns.\n\nThe issue of anonymity in reporting has sparked a debate about the credibility and motivations of these sources. With the media relying on vague descriptions from reporters and unverified claims, the public is left questioning the reliability of the information. The use of anonymous sources can be an indispensable aspect of journalism, but in this case, the continued anonymity of sources has raised questions about their credibility and the validity of the information they provide.\n\nThe media's use of anonymous sources has been a topic of discussion for some time, with concerns about the potential for misinformation or partisan bias. The administration's response to these reports, such as labeling them \"fake news,\" has further fueled this debate.\n\nIn light of the gravity of the accusations, the media's continued reliance on anonymous sources raises concerns about their courage and commitment to the truth. The public has lost trust in the so-called elite, and the use of the press to fight bureaucratic wars does little to dispel this perception. If the media believes that this president is a menace, going on the record and giving the public a chance to test their credibility would be the least they can do.",
    " Title: House Approves Bipartisan Border Funding Bill, Sending It to President Trump's Desk\n\nArticle:\n\nA coalition of moderate Democrats and Republicans approved a crucial border funding legislation late Thursday in the House, sending the $4.6 billion bill to President Trump's desk for his expected signature. The bill, which was passed without the inclusion of restrictions on immigration enforcement, was a bipartisan Senate-passed bill that was approved 84-8 a day earlier, following the rejection of an earlier House version.\n\nThe decision by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring the bipartisan bill to a vote, without such restrictions, was made under intense pressure from Republicans and moderates in her own party. The Senate had demonstrated bipartisan support for the bill, with 84 senators voting in favor of it.\n\nLiberal members, however, had sought to put restrictions back in the Senate bill, with measures aimed at ensuring the health and safety of those in custody, limiting the amount of time unaccompanied minors can spend at an influx shelter to 90 days, and reducing funding for ICE by $81 million.\n\nThe House vote is expected to ease a cash crunch at federal agencies that care for migrants who have flocked over the border in huge numbers seeking asylum. Vivid and painful accounts of harsh, even dangerous conditions at badly overcrowded federal facilities that house and care for thousands of migrants added to the pressure to act.\n\nThe rapid-fire sequence of events Thursday afternoon came after Republicans persistently called on House Democrats to pass the Senate bill in its \"clean\" form, noting that the White House said it would sign that bill. The White House had threatened to veto the House version.\n\nIn an astonishing spectacle, dozens of Republicans lined up in the aisles earlier Thursday to submit unanimous consent requests to take up the bill, with each one being shut down each time by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.\n\nThe decision is sure to fuel new unrest inside the caucus, with perhaps the most outspoken member of the progressive wing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., having declared \"Hell no\" to voting on the Senate bill.\n\nThe publication of an image of a migrant and his daughter found drowned in the Rio Grande has only fueled the debate nationally. Republicans, meanwhile, have continued to focus on closing loopholes that encourage migrants to make the perilous journey with children through Central America in order to be released into the U.S. It is those loopholes, they say, that have led to hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving at the border in recent months--many of them family units.",
    " Title: RNC Data Shows Improved Financial Situation for Voters in Key Battleground States, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic Party continues with their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, a new poll suggests that the Democratic Party is concerned about their ability to beat Trump in the 2020 election. The Iowa Caucus is less than 12 weeks away, and the Democratic field is still crowded.\n\nThe Trump campaign is emphasizing the President's fulfilled promises made during the 2016 election cycle, such as tax cuts, record-low unemployment rates, particularly for Hispanics and African Americans, and the Senate's confirmation of 99 judges (with more planned for the remainder of the year).\n\nAccording to new data from the Republican National Committee (RNC), Americans are experiencing the benefits of having President Trump in office. In three key battleground states - New Hampshire, Michigan, and Pennsylvania - voters say they are better off financially today than they were three years ago.\n\nRick Gorka, a Trump Victory spokesperson, stated, \"Democrats know they cannot beat President Donald Trump at the ballot box in 2020. The American people are better off today than they were three years ago, and a socialist nominee would only destroy the economic progress enjoyed by tens of millions.\"\n\nIn Michigan, voters are 17 percent more likely to believe they are better off financially today than they were three years ago. This number increases to 22 percent among voters under 35 years old and 22 percent among those residing in Macomb County, part of the Detroit metro area.\n\nIn New Hampshire, voters are 33 percent more likely to believe they are better off financially than they were before the Trump administration. Working moms in the state are 31 percent more likely to feel their financial situation has improved since Trump took office. For voters in rural Coos County, it's 34 percent more likely.\n\nPennsylvanians are also benefiting from the Trump economy, with 20 percent more voters agreeing that they are better off than they were three years ago. This number increases to 25 percent among voters under 35 years old and 18 percent among working moms in the state.\n\nThe RNC has invested over $350 million in data that tracks key issues in every state, allowing their data and analytics team to closely monitor electorates and the issues that are important to them. Bill Skelly, CEO of Causeway Solutions, a leader in the data field, described the RNC's information as \"unmatched.\"\n\n\"I work with RNC voter data every day, and the quality and breadth of information is unmatched,\" Skelly said. \"The data is refreshed daily with information collected through the tireless efforts of RNC-led volunteers, activists, and campaigns out there making phone calls and knocking on the doors of real voters in real time.\"\n\nThe RNC provides this data to campaigns at the federal, state, and local levels free of charge, asking for nothing in return except for Republicans across the country to keep the data up-to-date when they knock on doors and phone bank.\n\n\"Instead of paying for data, the GOP candidates and organizations use sweat equity to improve it,\" Skelly said. \"It is the secret weapon Republicans all over the country are able to deploy to win their political battles.\"",
    " Title: Trump's 2020 Election Advantage: Historical Trends, Economy, and Opponents\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's reelection prospects in 2020 may be bolstered by his primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist. Trump has at least five historical arguments in his favor for reelection.\n\n1. Incumbency: Incumbent presidents have won 14 out of 19 reelection bids since 1900. The few who lost did not enjoy positive approval ratings. In a recent Gallup poll, Trump achieved his highest approval rating since his inauguration, with 49% favorable and 50% unfavorable ratings.\n\n2. Economy: The U.S. economy, a significant factor in presidential elections, is currently experiencing low inflation, low interest rates, positive economic growth, near-record low unemployment, rising workers' wages, and record gas and oil production.\n\n3. Avoiding Historical Missteps: Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and Herbert Hoover were negatively impacted by the Vietnam War, the Iranian hostage crisis, the Iraq War, and the Watergate scandal, respectively.\n\n4. Minimizing Scandals: Scandals can potentially derail a presidency, as seen with the Watergate scandal that led to Richard Nixon's resignation.\n\n5. The Opponent Factor: The election of a president can be influenced by their opponent. For instance, the election of Lyndon Johnson was made certain by Barry Goldwater's caricature as an out-of-touch extremist, and George McGovern's radicalism ensured Richard Nixon's reelection.\n\nTrump's approval ratings have increased since the impeachment proceedings against him in September 2019. His current Gallup approval rating is four points higher than when he was inaugurated in January 2017. Trump also has more campaign funds and the full backing of the Republican Party compared to his 2016 campaign.\n\nHowever, the U.S. continues to borrow approximately $1 trillion per year, and Trump's spending habits mirror those of his predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who both increased the national debt during their terms. The global economy, particularly China, faces challenges such as the Hong Kong protests, the coronavirus, the trade war with the U.S., and the forced imprisonment of minority groups.\n\nEconomists predict a recession is unlikely in the eight months leading up to the election, given the near-record employment and increased disposable income from rising wages and lower taxes. Gallup found that 63% of the public approves of the Trump economy, the highest rating for any president in that category over the last 20 years.\n\nTrump's record suggests he is unlikely to favor preemptory attacks, nation-building, or the use of U.S. ground troops in large numbers. His use of air and sea power to accomplish limited objectives without committing U.S. ground troops to the Middle East is a notable aspect of his foreign policy.\n\nScandals, such as the impeachment proceedings and the investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, have not significantly impacted Trump's approval ratings. The more Democrats have pursued impeachment, investigations, lawsuits, and hysteria, the more Trump's approval ratings have risen.\n\nTrump's most likely opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, may be his greatest advantage in 2020. Sanders' radical agenda turns off a majority of the public, and even mainstream Democrats are wary of his redistribution schemes. Former front-runner Joe Biden has been hurt by revelations about his son Hunter's Ukrainian dealings, and the only other serious Democratic contender, multibillionaire Mike Bloomberg, has faced criticism for his shifting political allegiances and crass past comments.\n\nIn a dispassionate and historical analysis, the 2020 election appears to be Trump's to lose.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Critiques Media Bias in New Book, Accuses Fox News of Propaganda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her recently published book, \"What Happened,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has criticized elements of the media, particularly the New York Times, for their alleged bias. Clinton's book, according to some, reflects a one-sided view of the media, reminiscent of her 1998 statement on NBC's \"Today\" show, where she described a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" surrounding her husband, former President Bill Clinton, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\nIn the book, Clinton expresses her disdain for the press, a sentiment that has persisted for over a quarter-century. The author notes that Clinton's criticism of conservative media is perceived as a liberal Democrat catering to her base, a possible reason for her election loss.\n\nContrary to Clinton's assertion, she was treated fairly during her appearances on Fox News, and might have gained some swing voters had she conducted more interviews. Clinton granted few interviews to CNN or MSNBC, reflecting her wariness of such encounters.\n\nIn the book, Clinton labels Fox News as \"the most powerful and prominent platform for the right-wing war on truth,\" but provides little detail to support this claim. Clinton is aware that Fox News' news division plays it straight, but chooses to ignore the distinction between them and the conservative commentators she allegedly dislikes.\n\nIn a recent interview with \"Pod Save America,\" Clinton referred to Fox News as a \"dedicated propaganda channel,\" grouping it with Breitbart and \"crazy Infowars.\" Clinton's book also suggests that by 2016, most liberals and conservatives were obtaining their news from distinct sources, no longer sharing a common set of facts. However, Clinton attributes this polarization to Fox News \"polarizing the audience,\" while ignoring the polarization that exists within left-leaning outlets.\n\nClinton also criticizes Matt Lauer for allegedly being tougher on her than Donald Trump during NBC's Commander-in-Chief Forum. The author notes that Lauer asked Clinton a series of questions about the email scandal that she found difficult to answer. Clinton attributes this to the media's supposed reluctance to criticize Democrats for being soft on the right.\n\nClinton's defensiveness is evident as she criticizes the New York Times for breaking and sticking with the email story. She questions the charge that using personal email reinforced a narrative of secrecy, a point that most liberals would likely concede. Clinton also dismisses the email scandal as \"silly\" after admitting during the campaign that it was a mistake and repeatedly apologizing.\n\nHillary Clinton faced unfair press coverage during her campaign. It is questionable whether she is capable of offering an impartial analysis of her media coverage. However, if the \"right-wing\" media was such a problem, why does she remain so unhappy with the rest of the press?",
    " Title: White House Intercepts Threatening Letter Similar to Those Sent to Mayor Bloomberg and Gun-Control Group\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - The Secret Service has confirmed that a threatening letter addressed to President Barack Obama was intercepted this week, similar to the ricin-tainted letters mailed to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his gun-control group. The White House mail screening facility intercepted the letter, and it has been turned over to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force for testing and investigation.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest stated that all presidential mail is examined at an off-site facility, and the Secret Service added that precautions are in place for such incidents. The letter to Obama was discovered on Wednesday, and federal officials close to the investigation said there had been a heightened sense of alert due to the Bloomberg letters.\n\nThe other letters, postmarked May 20 in Shreveport, Louisiana, were opened in New York on Friday at the city's mail facility in Manhattan and in Washington on Sunday at an office of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly stated that the same machine or computer may have produced the three letters, and they may be identical.\n\nThe letters to Bloomberg and Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, both tested positive for ricin. Three New York officers involved in the case experienced mild diarrhea, a minor symptom of ricin exposure, while no symptoms were reported in Washington.\n\nRicin naturally occurs in castor beans and can be fatal if inhaled or ingested. Ricin-tainted threats have been sent recently to Obama, lawmakers, and judges. Last week, a Washington state man was accused of including ricin in a death threat mailed to a federal judge, and in late April, a Mississippi man was arrested on charges of mailing poisoned letters to Obama, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, and an 80-year-old judge in Tupelo, Mississippi.\n\nMayor Cedric Glover of Shreveport, Louisiana, stated that local police are working with the FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force to determine who sent the letters and where the ricin came from. Ricin-related threats have been sent to high-profile figures in the past, including President Obama, lawmakers, and judges.",
    " Title: Judge Gorsuch Distances Himself From Trump's Attacks on Judges, Senator Says\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut for revealing comments made by his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, that were critical of Trump's recent attacks on judges. During a private meeting, Gorsuch expressed his disapproval of Trump's comments, describing them as \"demoralizing\" and \"dismaying.\"\n\nGorsuch's team confirmed the comments to NPR's Tamara Keith. However, Trump has stated that the comments were \"mischaracterized.\" Trump also attacked Blumenthal for exaggerating his military service during his 2010 Senate campaign, when he was discovered to have falsely claimed that he had served in Vietnam.\n\nSenator Blumenthal described his meeting with Gorsuch on Wednesday, stating, \"He certainly expressed to me that he is disheartened by the demoralizing and abhorrent comments made by President Trump about the judiciary.\" Gorsuch is meeting with senators in preparation for his confirmation hearings.\n\nRepublican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska revealed stronger comments by Gorsuch during their meeting. \"He got pretty passionate,\" Sasse told MSNBC on Thursday. \"He said, 'Any attack on any of \u2014 I think his word to me was \u2014 'brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges.'\"\n\nTrump's attacks on the judiciary are unusual for a sitting president. Gorsuch has been a member of that branch of government as a federal judge since 2006. Senators will be considering whether he will remain independent should he be on the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump's attacks on the judiciary began last Friday with tweets disparaging federal Judge James L. Robart, who temporarily blocked the president's ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trump first called Robart a \"so-called judge,\" called his ruling \"a terrible decision,\" and then suggested Robart would be responsible if a terrorist attack should occur.\n\nAt a Thursday afternoon press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer doubled down on the assertion that Gorsuch was not specifically talking about Trump's tweet about the \"so-called\" Judge Robart. However, it's unclear why the Supreme Court nominee would bring up criticism of judges unless to talk about the president's recent statements that did just that. And the statements also contradict Sasse's account of their talk.\n\nOn Tuesday, three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments about whether to lift Robart's temporary block on the president's executive order. Wednesday morning, Trump switched his attack to them, or at least one of them whom he did not name. The president told a gathering of chiefs of police and sheriffs that he does not understand how any judge could rule against him.\n\nThe statement Trump referred to is the federal law granting a president authority to restrict who enters the United States. Trump's attack on Blumenthal refers back to a controversy during the senator's 2010 campaign. The New York Times uncovered at the time that Blumenthal said at a 2008 event honoring veterans and service members, \"We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.\" Except Blumenthal had received several deferments from going to Vietnam, and served in the Marine reserves, though not overseas. Blumenthal later apologized and said he meant to say, \"I served during Vietnam.\"\n\nBlumenthal responded to Trump's tweet in an interview on CNN, and Trump was apparently watching. The president sent out another tweet falsely claiming CNN did not ask Blumenthal about the controversy over his military record.",
    " Title: French Police Officer Dies in Exchange for Hostage, Raising Death Toll in Trebes Supermarket Siege\n\nArticle:\n\nA French police officer, Col. Arnaud Beltrame, who offered himself to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage during a supermarket siege in Trebes, France, has died of his injuries, raising the death toll to four. Beltrame, a decorated member of the elite police special forces, was honored Saturday as a national hero of \"exceptional courage and selflessness.\"\n\nCol. Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday. He joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005. He was married with no children.\n\nIn a hostage situation training session in December, Beltrame armed his officers with paintball guns, mimicking real-world conditions as closely as possible. When he went inside the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born captor, Beltrame left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nThe gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said in a statement, \"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much. In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nInvestigators will focus on how Lakdim obtained his weapon and became radicalized, according to President Macron. President Trump added his condolences to the victims of the attack in a tweet Saturday.\n\nLakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. He was under surveillance and on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other. He then fired six shots at police officers near Carcassonne, wounding one. Lakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, shooting and killing two people and taking an unknown number of hostages.\n\nDuring the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the November 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week's deadly assault in the south.",
    " Title: House Oversight Committee Requests IRS Official's Personal Email Documents\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has requested documents from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official Lois Lerner, who is at the center of an ongoing probe into the agency's targeting of Tea Party groups, regarding her personal email account. The committee claims that Lerner allegedly used her personal email account for official business.\n\nIn a letter to Lerner, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) stated that Lerner sent documents related to her official duties from her IRS email account to an account labeled 'Lois Home.' The letter requests all documents and communications housed in her msn.com account to understand the extent to which she may have used a non-official email account for official purposes.\n\nIssa suggested such activity could violate federal records requirements, create difficulties in filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and hinder congressional oversight obligations. The IRS acknowledged this spring that it had targeted Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations when they were applying for nonprofit status from 2010 to 2012.\n\nLerner, the former director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, invoked her Fifth Amendment rights in May when called before Congress to testify on the issue and has since been on paid leave. Issa and subcommittee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have given Lerner until Aug. 27 to comply with the request, which also covers any other non-official account that references Lerner's official IRS duties.\n\nA committee spokesman told FoxNews.com that such documents could be subpoenaed but declined to say whether investigators would take such action. An IRS spokesman said agency officials are awaiting receipt of the letter and will review it.\n\nThe targeting, which delayed groups learning whether they would be granted tax-exempt status, sparked public outrage and several other probes, including one by the FBI. The House oversight committee, as recently as this month, complained that acting IRS Commissioner Danny Wurfel has failed to comply promptly with requests to supply documents related to the investigation.",
    " Title: National Polls Show Tight Presidential Race as Election Day Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 U.S. presidential election draws near, the race between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney remains close, according to three national polls released today. The polls indicate a tight race, with some positive signs for Romney.\n\nRasmussen Reports' daily tracker shows a narrow lead for Romney, with 49% of the vote compared to Obama's 47%. Obama's numbers have been fluctuating between 46% and 47% for several days, while Romney has occasionally risen above 50%. Today, Romney dipped to 48%, while Obama remained static at 47%.\n\nIn Rasmussen's \"swing state\" tracker, Romney leads Obama by 4 percentage points, with 50% of the vote to Obama's 46%. Two percent of voters prefer another candidate, and another 2% are undecided. Romney has led for 12 consecutive days, with margins of 4 to 6 points most of the time.\n\nThe Washington Post/ABC News poll shows Romney leading Obama by a mere point, 49% to 48%. However, the poll's internal numbers suggest a more significant lead for Romney. For instance, the sample has a Democratic-leaning (D+7) composition, with Republicans turning out at a significantly lower rate than in 2008. If Romney wins independents by 15 points and neutralizes the gender gap, he can still lead by only one point overall, according to Ed Morrissey's calculations.\n\nThe Politico/GWU Battleground poll shows Obama inching back ahead by one point (49% to 48%), but the internal numbers tell a slightly different story. Romney leads by double-digits among independents (50% to 40%), improving upon Obama's eight-point win with independents in 2008. There is also an enthusiasm gap, with Romney maintaining a potentially pivotal advantage in intensity among his supporters. Sixty percent of those who support Obama say they are \"extremely likely\" to vote, compared to 73% who back Romney. Among this group, Romney leads Obama by 9 points, 53% to 44%.\n\nThe race is neck-and-neck, with 43% saying they will \"definitely\" vote for Romney, compared to 42% who say the same of the president. Romney has a 13-point intensity advantage, yet both he and Obama have strikingly low totals among \"definite\" supporters.\n\nThe bipartisan GWU/Battleground poll has also released a \"vote election model,\" which takes demographics, voter intensity, and other data into account. When they run these numbers, Romney emerges with a five-point national lead: 52% to 47%. The poll also found that Romney has an even greater advantage among middle-class voters, 52% to 45%. The poll's election model takes into account variables including voter intensity, age, and education, and voters who are certain in their vote.\n\nThe race \"remains very close in the surface,\" Goeas said, \"but the political environment and the composition of the likely electorate favor Governor Romney.\"\n\nUPDATE: Gallup's daily tracker shows a five-point Romney lead, 51-46.",
    " Title: Federal and State Efforts to Address PPE and Testing Shortages Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have emphasized that the federal government is pursuing multiple strategies to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing supplies, acknowledging that shortages are not unique to the United States. A spokesperson from HHS stated that the department has closely coordinated with FEMA and the White House's coronavirus task force to ensure a \"locally executive, state managed, and federally supported response.\"\n\nThe spokesperson noted that the current global pandemic has led to demand outweighing supply worldwide, not just in the U.S. FEMA and HHS are working to ensure federal contracting efforts do not compete with states' abilities to acquire PPE and other supplies.\n\nThe administration has touted the nation's testing ramp-up, stating that the U.S. is conducting more tests than any other country. On May 1, Brett Giroir, a top Trump health appointee and testing coordinator, praised an initiative to expand drive-through test sites across the country during a meeting of the interagency group as a \"great success.\"\n\nHowever, in the days prior, officials cautioned that states trying to test large numbers of patients were hampered by equipment and gear shortages. A regional official, speaking on behalf of the mid-Atlantic region, told the interagency group on April 24 that states' \"supply appears to be the main limiting factor.\" Officials representing the Northeastern states concurred, stating that funding and staff is not an inhibitor, but the ability to secure testing supplies and PPE is.\n\nWhile the nation's testing figures have risen over the last month, public health experts agree that the U.S. is still not testing enough people to have an accurate picture of the virus' spread. The administration is now shifting efforts from importing supplies to boosting domestic production of key materials like protective equipment. Some of these supplies are in demand not just in the health care system, but also by businesses trying to reopen while keeping workers and customers safe.\n\nDuring the meeting on May 1, participants grappled with the likelihood that as states began to lift their distancing restrictions, new coronavirus outbreaks would follow. Nearly all of FEMA's regional teams reported continued increases in both cases and deaths as governors moved to terminate stay-at-home orders, flagging new hot spots in prisons, meat processing plants, and other high-risk facilities.\n\nAt least two states, South Carolina and Georgia, were among those planning to reopen despite logging zero consecutive days of decreasing cases, according to one slide distributed to the group. In Georgia, new Covid-19 cases were up 65 percent, and deaths were up nearly 103 percent over a two-week period.\n\nTrump has vacillated between praising and criticizing Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's decision to reopen the state, but on the same day as regional officials expressed concerns in the meeting, the president broadly championed states' push to reopen. \"I like the states opening. They will be opening,\" he said. \"They're going to open safely and quickly, I hope, because we have to get our country back.\"\n\nThough some in the administration have publicly acknowledged that states were lifting restrictions before slowing the virus' spread, the president and his top advisers have largely cheered on the reopening states. They have also suggested that the CDC's criteria are guidelines, not mandates, that states can use as they see fit.\n\nHealth officials in the meantime continued to scramble to stand up new tools to monitor for outbreaks, pulling data from various parts of the government in an attempt to \"respond to the increased demand and burden on the system\" should new clusters of cases pop up. The odds of such virus clusters cropping up, they added, \"we of course consider inevitable.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, the officials also confronted a particularly bleak scenario: that the fresh waves of coronavirus cases could threaten once again to overwhelm the nation's health system. The U.S. has nearly 104,000 ventilators, according to one slide distributed to the group\u2014of which only about 30,000 were currently in use. Yet while Trump has latched onto that surplus in recent weeks as evidence of the administration's successful response\u2014dubbing the U.S. \"the king of ventilators\"\u2014officials on the call were focused on new modeling that predicted yet another ventilator crisis if Americans quickly resumed their pre-pandemic lives.\n\nThe model, outlined in a presentation slide obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, illustrated a worst-case scenario that showed the rash of new cases maxing out and soon exceeding the nation's ventilator supplies by the first week of June. The potential crisis was just one of the dangers officials on the call emphasized would require continuous monitoring\u2014and that, despite Trump's wish for a rapid return to normal, they warned could force the nation back into another damaging lockdown.\n\n\"As we lift mitigation, it's going to be critical to monitor local transmission, public health capacity, and health system capacity over time,\" one official said on May 1, \"and if needed, reinitiate mitigation in the coming weeks.\"",
    " Title: Unanswered Questions Remain in Ottawa Shooting Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the shooting incident in Ottawa, Canada, on Wednesday that left an army reservist dead, several questions remain unanswered. The attack, which occurred at the Parliament, was the latest in a series of troubling incidents in the nation.\n\nOn Monday, a man, reportedly radicalized, struck a soldier with his car, resulting in the soldier's death. Police later killed the man. Authorities had previously confiscated the passports of the individuals involved in both attacks, but there was no immediate indication that the incidents were related.\n\nBefore the two attacks, there was already concern about jihadist efforts in the nation. The U.S. heightened security at the Ottawa embassy and another consulate in the country after jihadist chatter indicated an attack could be imminent, according to officials.\n\nHowever, the motive behind the latest shooting remains unclear, as the gunman was killed in the incident. The gunman, identified as Michael Joseph Hall, who changed his name to Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was born in Canada in 1982. It is known that he converted to Islam, but there is no indication so far that he was associated with ISIS.\n\nOttawa Mayor Jim Watson stated that the gunman acted alone, and there is no known information about any ties to groups or organizations. A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that a connection to terrorism has not been ruled out.\n\nThe gunman shot the army reservist, Nathan Cirillo, in the back while he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial. The motive behind this specific act remains unclear.\n\nKevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms of Canada's House of Commons, is credited with bringing down the gunman. Details on how he stopped the gunman are not yet available, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will provide more information in a news conference scheduled for Thursday.\n\nShortly after the shooting at the memorial, a gunman entered the nearby building on Parliament Hill. Gunfire first erupted in the building's foyer, followed by a second round of shooting in a hallway or near the entrance to the parliament's library. The circumstances surrounding these events are also unclear.\n\nThe Canadian army reservist, Nathan Cirillo, was known for his strong and friendly demeanor. He was part of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a reserve unit of the Canadian army. The details of his life and the circumstances surrounding his death continue to be investigated.",
    " Title: Ohio Senate Race: Sherrod Brown and Josh Mandel Campaign in Crucial Battleground State\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama embarked on a bus tour in Ohio on Thursday, a state that is considered a crucial battleground not only for the presidential election but also for determining whether Democrats maintain control of the Senate. The state's Democratic incumbent, Sherrod Brown, is facing a challenge from the state's Republican treasurer, Josh Mandel.\n\nDuring a visit to Cleveland's West Side Market, Brown, while discussing a federal grant that assists vendors in accepting food stamps, addressed his campaign and Mandel indirectly. Brown stated, \"The difference between me and my opponent, by and large, is that I wake up every day trying to figure out how to create jobs. My opponent wakes up every day and figures out what office to run for next, and that really is the contrast. I'm doing my job every day. That's why it's no surprise when you pick a day to come out here that I'm doing my work, not campaigning.\"\n\nBrown, who voted for the new health care law, expressed satisfaction with the Supreme Court's upholding of most of it. However, when asked about campaigning on the widely unpopular law, Brown declined to comment.\n\nSome shoppers at the West Side Market expressed differing opinions on Brown discussing the health care law. Nancy Wassen, a Democrat from Ashland, stated, \"He voted for it. I think he kind of has to at least include that in what he talks about.\" Laura Dorrie, a retired teacher and undecided independent, said, \"Right now, there are a lot of people that are against Obamacare, so I'm not sure that that's the wisest decision to make.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mandel is expected to visit the working-class Cleveland suburb of Parma on Thursday, following President Obama. Mandel, a former Marine intelligence officer who served two tours in Iraq, is a rising star in the Republican Party and a favorite of the Tea Party. In an interview, Mandel emphasized his opposition to the health care law, stating, \"Sherrod Brown held in his hands the power to stop this government-run health care act, but instead of stopping it, he cast the deciding vote on the federal government's takeover of health care.\"\n\nPolitifact has labeled this \"deciding-vote\" claim as false. Mandel has also made questionable claims about campaign spending, stating, \"At the end of the day, you know, Sherrod Brown's going to have a lot more money than we're going to have, but this race isn't about money.\" Records provided by the Brown campaign show that outside groups backing Mandel have spent nearly five times more than groups backing Brown.\n\nNearly $10 million worth of TV ads paid for by outside groups and favoring Mandel have already aired in Ohio, including one from Crossroads GPS that says it's no surprise Brown voted for Obamacare: \"He supports Obama's agenda 95 percent of the time.\" Groups such as Crossroads GPS do not have to disclose their donors. Brown suspects the money is coming from business groups opposed to his union-friendly voting record.\n\nRecent polls show Brown ahead of Mandel by single digits, with the gap narrowing as outside money continues to pour in.",
    " Title: Mueller Investigation Expected to Advance Significant New Aspects in 2019, Possibly Targeting Trump and Family Members\n\nArticle:\n\nThe special counsel investigation into Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign is expected to advance significant new aspects in 2019, potentially targeting President Donald Trump and members of his family. The investigation, led by Robert Mueller, has been notoriously leak-proof, with little information about its progress becoming public.\n\nAnalysts interviewed by various news outlets have warned that the velocity and direction of Mueller's investigation are difficult to predict, as his team does not leak private information. However, the broadest question about what the next year might hold pertains to Mueller's core investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nAlex Whiting, a Harvard law professor and former prosecutor on the international criminal court, stated, \"I think the biggest question is, is he going to present evidence that Trump committed crimes? Either obstruction of justice or collusion. He wouldn't bring an indictment because justice department policy won't permit it. But whatever evidence would be handed off, I think, to the Congress, and it will have to be considered.\"\n\nThe public has gained a limited view on the progress of Mueller's core investigation, with major developments in 2018, such as the April raid on former Trump fixer Michael Cohen's home and the fiery Flynn sentencing hearing earlier this month, revealing relatively little about the investigation's progress. Mueller's documents, such as the draft plea agreement with conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, have been heavily redacted, with sections describing Russia-related matters almost entirely blacked out.\n\nIf Trump himself would be the biggest target Mueller might approach in 2019, and Corsi or Stone would be lower-level targets, Mueller might also target someone just short of the president, such as Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Both men appear to be legally exposed to charges of making false statements either to investigators or to Congress.\n\nBarb McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor and former US attorney, pointed to Mueller's description of Cohen's cooperation and noted that Cohen had \"described the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries\" \u2013 a response he later admitted was false. McQuade stated, \"That suggests there were others who were trying to get their story straight. And I imagine that that would be an area that Mueller would look at, to say: 'Well, Michael Cohen told a lie. Did anyone else tell the same lie?'\"\n\nMajor incidents before or after the last US presidential election could emerge as focal points for Mueller in the new year. The special counsel might reveal new evidence about the circumstances surrounding a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, or a February 2017 meeting between Trump and Comey, at which Comey said that Trump encouraged him to drop an investigation of Flynn.\n\nFurther criminal charges might emerge in the case of hush payments made to the porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, or new details might emerge of projects or prospective projects advanced by Trump and his family in Moscow or the Middle East. In the background would be questions about the nature of the Trump campaign's relationships at the time with any foreign backers. Foreign countries and nationals are not supposed to be involved in US campaigns or elections.\n\nLisa K Griffin, a law professor at Duke University with a focus on federal criminal justice policy, stated, \"We all at this moment know very little about where Robert Mueller's investigation will lead, because it has been so leak-free and they have been so careful about keeping their cards very close to the vest, and admirably so.\" Whiting added, \"Trump has tried repeatedly to minimize this investigation, to delegitimize it, to dismiss it, and that hasn't worked and it's not going to work. I think this investigation and the consequences are going to be significant and they're here to stay, and there's nothing he can do about it.\"",
    " Title: Arkansas Oil Spill from ExxonMobil's Pegasus Pipeline Used as Ammunition Against Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent oil spill from ExxonMobil's Pegasus pipeline in Arkansas, carrying Canadian oil sands similar to those proposed for the Keystone XL pipeline, has become a fresh point of contention in the ongoing debate over the proposed Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline. The spill, which occurred in the small town of Mayflower, has led to the evacuation of more than 20 families. ExxonMobil estimates that \"a few thousand barrels of oil\" were spilled in the area.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when the oil and gas industry, along with other proponents of the Keystone pipeline, enjoy growing bipartisan support in Congress and are backed by a strong majority of the American people. The project has been under review by the State Department, with President Obama reportedly leaning toward approving the project following a favorable environmental review.\n\nHowever, critics are now using the Mayflower spill and cleanup effort as evidence of the potential risks associated with large-scale pipeline projects. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, stated, \"This latest toxic mess is just another reminder that oil companies can not be trusted to transport toxic tar sands crude through Americans' backyards. It's not a matter of if spills will occur on dangerous pipelines like the Keystone XL, but rather, when.\"\n\nRep. Edward J. Markey, Massachusetts Democrat and candidate for his state's open U.S. Senate seat, made a similar argument. \"Whether it's the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, or this mess in Arkansas, Americans are realizing that transporting large amounts of this corrosive and polluting fuel is a bad deal for American taxpayers and for our environment,\" he said in a statement.\n\nEnvironmental groups argue that the thick Canadian oil sands could pose unique dangers to pipelines due to faster corrosion and other factors. The exact cause of the spill, ExxonMobil stated, remains unclear and is under investigation. The company also claims it has taken steps to ensure that no oil reaches nearby Lake Conway.\n\nThe Arkansas spill is the latest in a series of incidents raised by Keystone critics to demonstrate pipeline safety concerns and other dangers associated with crude oil transport. They are also pointing to last week's rupture of a Chevron Corp. pipeline in Utah; the derailment of a southbound train carrying Canadian oil sands through Minnesota last week; and numerous other incidents over the past few years.\n\nMeanwhile, even before the Arkansas incident, President Obama was set to face opposition from the environmental movement. Liberal activist group Credo, the Sierra Club, and others have organized a protest in front of a Democratic Party fundraiser in San Francisco, an event the president is scheduled to attend. Credo also has promised to mobilize more than 50,000 activists to engage in \"civil disobedience\" in front of government office buildings, outside banks financing the project, and at other locations if Mr. Obama approves Keystone.\n\nSupport for the pipeline had been increasing both in Congress and among voters, though it remains to be seen whether that support erodes due to the Arkansas incident. A March 28 Rasmussen survey found that 58 percent of likely U.S. voters support building the pipeline, while just 26 percent are opposed to it. The poll also reported that, despite the demonstrations and protests of the environmental movement, the real passion lies on the pro-Keystone side of the debate. One-third of likely voters \"strongly favor\" building the pipeline, while just 12 percent \"strongly oppose\" it, the survey shows.",
    " Title: Benghazi Committee Requests Transcribed Interview with Hillary Clinton Regarding Email Practices\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Benghazi investigative committee, chaired by Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, has formally requested a transcribed interview with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to discuss her decision-making process regarding the emails she handed over to the government and why she wiped her email server clean.\n\nIn a letter to Clinton's attorney, Gowdy stated that Clinton's \"unique arrangement with herself\" needs to be explained, as the State Department begins to disclose some of her emails that she withheld for years. One of the early messages contradicts Clinton's claim that she wanted to use a single electronic device for email.\n\nGowdy emphasized that the interview would be conducted behind closed doors but would be part of the committee's investigation's record. A public hearing would be held once the select investigative committee has gathered all necessary documents, according to Gowdy.\n\nThe chairman pointed out that the emails are under committee investigation, and any action to destroy them would be illegal. He stated that this is why Clinton must turn over her server to a neutral third party, a request that Clinton's team has rejected, claiming she has already complied with the law.\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill stated that Clinton looks forward to a public hearing, but he did not address Gowdy's request for a transcribed interview. The White House, which has tried to keep the Clinton email situation at arm's length, declined to comment on the Benghazi committee's request.\n\nClinton has stated that she used an email server she set up at her home in New York, and issued herself her own email address, because she wanted to use a single device and account for both personal and private mail. She has said she determined that about 30,000 of her 62,000 emails from her time in office were government-related, and in December\u2014nearly two years after she left office\u2014she turned those over to the State Department amid prodding by the Benghazi committee.\n\nThe emails Clinton turned over amounted to 55,000 pages. The State Department stated this week that it will take several months to process those emails because it needs to scan the pages to create digital files and then needs to run them by authorities to determine what can be released publicly.\n\nIn a court filing this week, the Obama administration stated it wants to rush production of all of those emails online and rejected a request from a conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, for a quick turnaround on an open-records request. The State Department didn't apply that to all requests. The Associated Press reported Tuesday morning that the department had released four of Clinton's emails to the news organization\u2014including one that showed Clinton used an iPad in addition to her mobile phone for sending emails.\n\nJudicial Watch has multiple outstanding requests for Clinton emails. Its president, Tom Fitton, stated that the State Department has searched Clinton's emails in one of those requests and will divulge the results to the group on Thursday. \"It is not a matter of playing favorites; it is a matter of further harming [through delay] our right to know under the Freedom of Information Act, which the agency has trashed,\" Mr. Fitton said.",
    " Title: Edward Snowden's Complex Path to U.S. Courts: A Look at the Asylum Pursuit and Extradition Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nEdward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, is facing a complex legal journey as he seeks asylum and navigates the international legal system following his admission of leaking classified information. In a recent interview with The Guardian, Snowden expressed his hope for asylum in a country like Iceland, while currently residing in a hotel in Hong Kong.\n\nSnowden's situation differs from that of Bradley Manning, the army private currently on trial at Fort Meade, Maryland, for leaking vast amounts of data to WikiLeaks. Manning faces life imprisonment, but as a member of the military, he is being tried via court-martial. Snowden did not sell the secrets or give them to a foreign power, so he will not be subject to the severe penalties of the espionage laws, as Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames were when they were caught spying.\n\nThe Justice Department can charge Snowden, indict him, and leave the charge pending, but to proceed further, he would need to be brought back to U.S. soil. The extradition treaty between the United States and Hong Kong contains an exception for political crimes, a category Snowden's admitted acts would likely fall under. However, Hong Kong could choose to simply expel him without handing him over to American authorities.\n\nThe complications surrounding Snowden's status are further exacerbated by the recent summit between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at improving relations between the two countries. Turning Snowden over to the Americans could have significant diplomatic consequences, while remanding him to the United States might serve as an act of good faith for the Chinese but could also incur high demands for concessions.\n\nThe United States does not have a separate extradition treaty with China. If Snowden can find a Hong Kong consulate of a nation that will welcome him, he could potentially remain there indefinitely without being captured by U.S. or Chinese officials, similar to Julian Assange's situation in London. However, it is unlikely that another country would shelter Snowden and bear the political costs of harboring such a high-profile American wanted by the U.S. government.\n\nRyan Scoville, an expert in international law at Marquette University Law School, stated, \"There has to be a political decision on the part of the extraditing country that that sort of act is in its political interest.\" The possibility of another country granting Snowden asylum and sheltering him remains, but it is considered unlikely.",
    " Title: Clinton Leads in Latest Polls, FiveThirtyEight Predicts 85% Chance of Win\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest polls indicate a strong lead for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, with a 12-point advantage over her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, according to the ABC tracking poll. This lead is larger than in most other polls, but the overall trend across polls shows Clinton's percentage increasing by a comfortable margin.\n\nNate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com has outlined four possible outcomes for the race, with all but one featuring a Clinton win. These outcomes range from a narrow Clinton win, a Clinton win in the \"Obama zone,\" and a Clinton blowout, to a Trump win, including cases where he loses the popular vote but wins the Electoral College.\n\nFiveThirtyEight's model, which averages polls, shows Clinton with an 85 percent probability of winning and currently ahead by 6.6 points. The New York Times Upshot has a 92 percent probability of a Clinton win, with Clinton having 85 percent or higher in all predictions.\n\nFor down-ballot races, the possibility of Democrats winning the Senate is not guaranteed, but it is more likely if they retain the White House due to the number of seats Republicans are defending. However, the outcome is not assured, and some analysts suggest the possibility of ticket splitting.\n\nRegarding the House, Democrats had written off the possibility of winning due to gerrymandering and population patterns that pack Democrats into districts. However, a Clinton win by 8 percent or more could potentially give Democrats a chance at taking control of the House.\n\nThe dramatic shift in October is attributed to Trump's self-inflicted wounds, such as his 3 a.m. tweets about the former Miss Universe and the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which revealed his horrifying misogyny. Additionally, right-wing media and people in or around the Trump campaign spread spurious rumors about Clinton's health, which may have contributed to the growing gender gap.\n\nClinton's health scare at the 9/11 ceremony in New York and her subsequent recovery and debate prep may have also played a role in the shift. When she appeared healthy, sharp, and aggressive during the debates, it changed the narrative and reminded voters of her formidable leadership qualities.",
    " Title: CIA's Destruction of Senate Torture Report Raises Questions on U.S. Government's Compliance with Law\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported that the CIA's Inspector General claimed the agency inadvertently destroyed its only copy of a classified, three-volume Senate report on torture. This incident has prompted a leading senator to question the authenticity of the alleged accident.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a series of \"accidental\" losses of incriminating information by U.S. government agencies during the current administration. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), whose Tea Party-targeting scandal is over 1,100 days old without any charges or jail sentences, has reportedly destroyed hard drives containing potentially incriminating evidence despite court orders, Congressional inquiries, and widespread belief that these \"accidents\" were deliberate, illegal destruction of incriminating evidence to protect the guilty.\n\nSimilarly, emails from Hillary Clinton's IT guy, believed to have set up her private unsecure server, have been deleted.\n\nThe phrase \"Destroy the evidence, and you've got it made\" from an old frozen dinner commercial seems to be the motto of the United States government, as people wonder why they should obey the law when the government appears to disregard it.\n\nPeople follow the law for various reasons, including fear of punishment, agreement with the law, and a sense of duty to maintain a viable society. However, when people at the top treat the law with contempt, it undermines the trust in the system and may encourage law-abiding citizens to question the value of playing by the rules.\n\nGonzalo Lira, a writer who warned of a coming middle-class anarchy during the financial crisis, stated, \"A terrible sentence, when a law-abiding citizen speaks it: Everybody else is doing it\u2014so why don't we?\" He further noted that law-abiding middle-class citizens are deciding that playing by the rules is a \"sucker's game.\"\n\nAmerica has been, and for the moment remains, a high-trust society. However, the head of the society is currently facing criticism for its contempt towards the law and the bourgeoisie. As Lira suggests, \"I'm like Wayne Gretzky: I don't concern myself with where the puck has been\u2014I look for where the puck is going to be.\" The question remains: Where will our society be in a decade if these trends continue? And what can we do to ensure that they don't?\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588's Board of Contributors.

    " Title: Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan Selected as Vice Presidential Running Mate for Mitt Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the newly chosen vice presidential running mate for Republican Mitt Romney, visited his alma mater, Miami University of Ohio, on Wednesday. Ryan graduated from the university in 1992 with degrees in economics and political science.\n\nRob Harrelson, a member of the school's College Republicans (as was Ryan, two decades earlier), expressed enthusiasm about Ryan's selection. \"He's young, he's energetic, he's popular, he's rising through the ranks of the Republican Party and in the House,\" says Harrelson. \"I think he's a great candidate. He's bringing a lot of energy to the campaign.\"\n\nAt 42, Ryan is the nation's first vice presidential candidate from Generation X. Harrelson, 21, believes Ryan's youth and ideas about the economy will attract more of today's college students to the right. \"I absolutely think that Ryan will appeal to the younger voters with his budget proposal,\" says Harrelson, speaking at Bagel and Deli in downtown Oxford, Ohio, packed with college students fresh off of summer vacation and parents helping them move into the dorms. \"It cuts government regulation. It cuts the red tape that's really crippling our economy, and I think that his plan will really resonate.\"\n\nIn the 2008 election, Republicans lost a lopsided battle for young voters against President Obama. Only a third of voters under 30 voted for Sen. John McCain in 2008, which made for the largest disparity between young voters and other age groups since exit polling began in 1972.\n\nPatrick Haney, a professor of political science at Miami University in Ohio, is unsure if picking Ryan will make much of a difference in attracting young voters. \"That voting age group, certainly in the last election, skewed to Obama,\" says Haney. \"But they primarily skew toward not voting.\"\n\nOf the students interviewed by NPR at Miami University, Xavier University, and the University of Cincinnati, only a handful knew the name Paul Ryan, and even fewer knew of his budget plan. Many said they were either uninterested in the race or planning to check in on it later.\n\nTyler Hawkins, a senior at Xavier in Cincinnati, put it this way: \"I've just been busy, and, honestly, it's a little boring to me.\"\n\nAccording to census data, the youth turnout hit its third-highest rate ever in 2008 at 51 percent. Many expect that number to drop in 2012.\n\nHaney is not sure picking Ryan will make much of a difference in attracting young voters. \"So, you know, the question is\u2014is a pick like that meant to have some impact on younger voters who...I guess there was some evidence to suggest were tuning out of this election?\" says Haney. \"Maybe, but I tend to doubt that age had much to do with the pick.\"\n\nHaney suspects it has more to do with energizing the Republican base than bringing out the youth vote. Ryan's stances on social issues like abortion and gay marriage are more in line with traditional religious conservatives than with typical college students. Haney adds that, like their elders, young voters usually do not focus on the lower half of the ticket.",
    " Title: FBI Officials' \"Secret Society\" Reference Under Scrutiny Amid Missing Text Messages\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo top FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who have been under fire for exchanging thousands of text messages during the 2016 election, reportedly discussed a \"secret society\" within the Department of Justice and the FBI the day after President Donald Trump's victory, according to Reps. Trey Gowdy and John Ratcliffe.\n\nStrzok, a top counterintelligence official involved in both the Hillary Clinton email probe and FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, exchanged more than 50,000 messages with Page, with whom he was romantically involved.\n\nDuring a Monday appearance on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum,\" Gowdy and Ratcliffe revealed that among the messages the pair exchanged are references to a \"secret society\" within the Department of Justice and the FBI.\n\n\"We learned today about information that in the immediate aftermath of [Trump's] election, that there may have been a secret society of folks within the Department of Justice and the FBI -- to include Page and Strzok -- that would be working against him,\" Ratcliffe said. He added, \"I'm not saying that actually happened, but when folks speak in those terms, they need to come forward to explain the context with which they used those terms.\"\n\nGowdy stated that the \"secret society\" reference occurred the day after Trump won the presidential election in November 2016. \"There's a text exchange between these two FBI agents, these two supposed to be objective fact-centric FBI agents, saying that perhaps this is the first meeting of the'secret society,'\" Gowdy said.\n\nThe \"secret society\" reference has raised questions about what may have been going on at the FBI. In one previously released message, Strzok appeared to make a reference to an \"insurance policy\" against a Trump win.\n\n\"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office -- that there's no way he gets elected -- but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40...,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Strzok claims the message was addressing a colleague who felt the FBI could take its time with allegations of Trump/Russia collusion because Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was thought certain to win. \"Andy,\" meanwhile, may have been a reference to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who is at the center of new tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nAxios reported late Monday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, urged by President Trump, has been pressuring FBI Director Christopher Wray to fire McCabe. The outlet reported that Wray threatened to resign if McCabe was fired. White House Counsel Don McGahn reportedly told Sessions that McCabe wasn't worth losing the FBI director over and risking another media firestorm like when Trump axed former director James Comey last year.\n\nThe developments come as the DOJ announced that the FBI \"failed to preserve\" five months of texts between Strzok and Page. \"We will leave no stone unturned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced and will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source,\" Sessions said in a statement provided to Fox News. \"If we are successful, we will update the congressional committees immediately.\"\n\nThe missing messages from Strzok and Page span a crucial window, between the presidential transition and the launch of Mueller's Russia probe. Strzok was removed from the probe by Mueller after he learned of the messages.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Trump described the missing messages as \"one of the biggest stories in a long time.\"",
    " Title: Sen. Ted Cruz's Statement on Gun Prosecutions Under Obama Declared \"Mostly True\" by Politifact\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Ted Cruz's statement on the decline in gun prosecutions under President Obama, made on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on Nov. 8, has been declared \"mostly true\" by Politifact. Cruz stated that under President George W. Bush, prosecutions of gun crimes were 30 percent higher than they are under President Obama.\n\nPolitifact initially criticized Cruz for \"cherry-picking\" data by comparing the year with the highest number of prosecutions under President George W. Bush (11,015 in 2004) to the 7,774 under Obama in 2012. However, if Cruz had chosen any year from 2002 to 2008, it would have shown more prosecutions than 2012.\n\nCatherine Frazier, Cruz's spokesperson, stated that the senator's point is that more can be done to target violent criminals, and that the Obama administration has not made this a priority. The senator believes that the focus should be on prosecuting those who commit gun crimes, not on taking away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nPolitifact also found fault in the source of the data, as Cruz cited the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse from Syracuse University, which tracks prosecutions in which the lead charge is firearms-related. If one digs into the charges, the most common prosecution is for a felon possessing a firearm. The entire background check system was devised under President Bill Clinton to stop criminals from buying guns, yet 5,487 felons were charged in 2012 with possession.\n\nPolitifact used other Justice Department figures in which gun charges were included in higher charges to discredit the Syracuse data. However, by looking at all charges, it benefits Obama because the 2004 number (12,962) was the lowest in Bush's presidency. Nevertheless, the Justice figures are irrelevant to the debate on gun control, as new laws are not aimed at reducing overall violence, but rather access to firearms.\n\nThe number of prosecutions is related to the call by Obama and gun control advocates like New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg for a federal \"universal background check,\" so that even private exchanges have to go through the government. Cruz co-sponsored with Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa the GOP alternative amendment to the \"universal background checks\" bill pushed by Obama and some Senate Democrats. The Grassley-Cruz amendment would have focused on prosecuting existing laws on background checks instead of trying to bring more law-abiding gun owners into a broken system.\n\nThe critical problem with the current background check system is that the bad guys aren't getting caught when they attempt to illegally buy guns. According to the most recent data from 2010, 94 percent of denials for gun purchases through the FBI's National Instant Background Checks System were not investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). As I wrote in my book, \"Emily Gets Her Gun\" (Regnery, 2013), of all the cases investigated by ATF field offices in 2010, only 62 charges were referred to prosecutors. Then only 13 charges led to guilty pleas. So from the original denied background checks at the licensed dealer, only two out of every 10,000 ended in getting a criminal off the street.\n\nCruz is absolutely correct that prosecutions for gun crimes have not been a priority for this White House, which is proven in the statistics. Obama has focused his second term on things like the \"assault weapons ban\" and \"universal background checks\" \u2014 neither of which has ever been proven to reduce violence, which is all that matters.",
    " Title: Five Common Misconceptions About the House Freedom Caucus Debunked\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus (HFC), a group of about 40 conservative Republican lawmakers, has been a target of criticism and misinformation in the modern political landscape. In an effort to set the record straight, this article addresses five popularly repeated myths about the HFC.\n\n1. The House Freedom Caucus Is Trying to Shut Down the Government:\nThe HFC is not attempting to shut down the government. Instead, they advocate for a return to regular order, where Congress enacts a series of 12 appropriations bills over the course of the year, allowing for debate on each one to ensure wise and appropriate spending. The HFC opposes the practice of presenting lawmakers with a massive spending bill at the last minute, forcing them to vote for it or risk a government shutdown.\n\n2. The HFC Has Been Shut Out of the Lawmaking Process:\nThe HFC has been portrayed as being shut out of the lawmaking process by their own party's leadership, being punished for dissent against House Speaker John Boehner. However, the HFC is not interested in hijacking anything; they simply want to keep the promises they made to their constituents and not be forced to support bills that would make them appear hypocritical to their voters.\n\n3. The House Freedom Caucus Is Only Interested in Attacking Obama:\nContrary to media claims, the HFC's differences with President Obama are not personal. They seek negotiation, not confrontation. The president has been notoriously imperious in his dealings with Congress, refusing to engage in discussions and demanding that his agenda be accepted without debate.\n\n4. The House Freedom Caucus Is Bad for the Party:\nThe HFC is often criticized for causing chaos within the Republican Party. However, the HFC's vigorous disagreement is a reflection of the Founding Fathers' desire for debate, ensuring that the truth emerges and that voters are presented with a range of opinions, not just a party line. The HFC's conflict of ideas helps strengthen the Party.\n\n5. The House Freedom Caucus Is a Bunch of Right-Wing Marxists:\nThis myth is baseless. The HFC's policies are in direct opposition to those espoused by Marx. The HFC aims to combat the $18 trillion debt, economic stagnation, a bankrupt entitlement system, and government encroachment on personal liberty. These are issues that the GOP claims to stand for, and the HFC seeks to follow through on these principles with action.",
    " Title: Judge Orders U.S. Government to Cover Costs of Reuniting Separated Families\n\nArticle:\n\nA U.S. District Judge in California has ordered the Trump administration to cover the costs of reuniting approximately 2,000 immigrant parents with their children who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. The government had initially proposed that the parents pay for the reunification process.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw, who ordered the children to be reunited with their parents by July 26, stated at a hearing in San Diego that it was illogical for the parents to bear the costs of reunification. The government missed the deadline for reuniting the youngest of the children with their parents this week.\n\nThe Trump administration's hardline immigration policies, which include the family separation policy, have been a central part of the president's presidency. The administration abandoned the family separation policy on June 20 due to political pressure.\n\nA lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued the administration over the family separations, stated at the hearing that immigrant parents had been told by immigration officials they had to pay for their travel. One parent was initially asked to pay $1,900 to be reunited with a child, according to ACLU court papers.\n\nTrump administration lawyer Sarah Fabian called the judge's order on paying for the reunifications \"a huge ask on HHS,\" referring to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Fabian stated that decisions regarding costs were handled at the field level, adding that HHS, which houses the detained children, had limited resources.\n\nThe judge also agreed to impose timelines on the government for reporting details about its reunification efforts. The administration has stated that its initial reunifications were slowed by the need for DNA testing and criminal background checks on parents, and to determine their fitness to care for their children.\n\nIn a filing with the court, HHS official Chris Meekins stated that the administration had streamlined its vetting procedures to comply with a July 10 court order. However, Meekins also noted that the swifter process could put children at risk. Adults are no longer being DNA tested to verify parentage, and background checks are not being performed on adults who will be living with the children. Meekins stated that while abbreviated vetting speeds up the reunification process, it also \"materially increases the risk of harm to children\" and could result in children being placed in abusive environments or with adults who are not their parents.\n\nThe government has stated its intention to identify between six and eight locations where all reunifications will take place. The government's filing did not specify whether it intends to release families after reunification, deport them, or keep them together in detention.",
    " Title: College-Age Americans' Support for Free Speech Decreases Over Decades, Converging with Older Generations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe General Social Survey, initiated in the '70s, has periodically asked Americans if they believe someone should have the right to give a racist speech in their community. John Sides, a political scientist, has analyzed the responses and categorized the participants into four groups: Americans aged 18 to 25 who have had at least some college education, Americans aged 18 to 25 with no college education, older Americans with at least some college education, and older Americans with no college education.\n\nThe data shows a significant decrease in the percentage of college-age individuals supporting the freedom of speech for a racist over the four decades. Interestingly, the college-age group is not leading the way in this regard but is instead converging with the non-college group. Notably, the significant drop in the college-age group's support for free speech ended in the late '80s, with a slight decline in the '90s and a resurgence in the 21st century.\n\nThis trend contradicts the common perception that the '90s marked the beginning of the age of political correctness. Instead, Sides suggests viewing this period as a time of backlash against political correctness. The first wave of \"PC Kids Gone Mad!\" stories that emerged in the national press in 1990 was not a sign of growing pro-censorship sentiments; rather, it indicated a growing resistance to such sentiments.\n\nIn addition to the decline in tolerance for controversial speech among college-age individuals, Sides also charts the percentage of Americans in each group who support free speech for communists. The drop in the college crowd's support is less severe, with over 50% still supporting the communist's rights, but there is still a noticeable decrease at the beginning, followed by a flattening in the '90s and a resurgence in the post-9/11 era.\n\nThe decline in collegiate civil libertarianism resumed after the '90s is a significant question, and one possible factor could be the increasing number of college-age individuals who do not remember the '80s. Backlashes tend to fade with memory. Another interesting trend observed in Sides' data is the growing tolerance among older Americans with no college education. A third chart, not reproduced here, shows a similar jump in the number of non-college-educated older Americans willing to back the free-speech rights of an atheist.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz Vow to Continue Campaigns Despite New York Primary Losses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Tuesday's New York primaries, both the Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz campaigns have vowed to press on towards their respective party conventions, disregarding suggestions from their rivals that their campaigns are mathematically eliminated from the race.\n\nFollowing a third-place finish in New York, Cruz's path to overtake Donald Trump in the Republican race before the July convention appears slim. On the Democratic side, Sanders would need to win 73% of the remaining delegates and uncommitted superdelegates to catch up to Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton, who could still clinch the nomination even if she loses every remaining primary, declared victory on Tuesday night, stating, \"The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight.\" A campaign aide, speaking off the record, suggested Sanders has no mathematical chance of a comeback.\n\nTrump, who declared, \"We don't have much of a race anymore,\" at his own victory party, is aiming to secure the nomination by racking up delegates in the coming weeks. According to The Washington Post, an internal Trump memo projects Trump would get more than 1,400 delegates on the first round of balloting to secure the nomination.\n\nCruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, if they can hold Trump under the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the convention, aim to have delegate allies in place from across the country who would peel off from Trump and support them after the first round of voting. Cruz's campaign is also courting \"unbound\" delegates in several states, including Pennsylvania, in hopes they would support him in the event of a floor fight.\n\nSanders, presuming he cannot clinch the nomination before the Philadelphia convention, is pursuing a strategy that relies on winning over superdelegates, the party insiders and officials free to support whomever they want. Clinton holds an overwhelming lead among them and is well-positioned to reach the 2,383 total delegates needed by the end of primaries in June, counting both superdelegates and pledged.\n\nSanders has given mixed signals following his New York loss. He took a day off from the campaign trail Wednesday to return to Vermont, and senior adviser Tad Devine described next week as a \"big week.\" Sanders plans to return to the campaign trail in Pennsylvania on Thursday.\n\nFew in the Democratic Party expect Sanders to exit the race formally before the final contests in June. He continues to attract tens of thousands to rallies and raises millions of dollars, enabling him to sustain his persistent fight.",
    " Title: Egypt's Former President Hosni Mubarak Ordered Conditional Release from Prison\n\nArticle:\n\nEgyptian judicial officials have ordered the conditional release of former President Hosni Mubarak, who ruled the nation for three decades before being ousted in a popular revolution in 2011. The decision, which comes amidst ongoing protests and violence in Egypt, could potentially escalate the unrest in the North African country.\n\nThe announcement, made as Egypt grapples with new protests following the July 3 ouster of Mubarak's successor, Mohammad Morsi, has sparked fears of further violent reprisals from the Muslim Brotherhood, whose supporters have clashed with security forces and torched dozens of Coptic churches. Over the past week, as many as 1,000 Egyptians, including 70 soldiers and police officers, have been killed in the conflict between the Muslim Brotherhood and more secular Muslims and Christians.\n\nOn Sunday, 36 Islamists died while being transported to a prison outside Cairo. Government officials stated they suffocated in the back of a prison van after tear gas was used on them as they rioted. The Muslim Brotherhood accused the interior ministry of killing the detainees \"for their opposition to the bloody military council.\"\n\nMubarak, currently on retrial for the killings of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 uprising, will be released from jail in the next 48 hours after a prosecutor cleared him of a corruption charge, his lawyer Fareed El-Deeb told Reuters. However, The New York Times reported that the government could still find a way to hold Mubarak, and his release is not imminent.\n\nMubarak will continue to stand retrial for the protesters' killing but can no longer be held in custody due to a two-year limit for holding an individual in custody pending a final verdict. Mubarak has been in detention since April 2011 and is currently held at Tora prison on the southern outskirts of Cairo, the same facility where senior members of the Muslim Brotherhood are being held.\n\nMubarak was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in June 2012 for his failure to stop the killing of some 900 protesters during the 18-day uprising against his rule. His sentence was overturned on appeal, and he is now being retried, along with his security chief and six top police commanders.\n\nJudicial authorities ordered Mubarak's release in one of the remaining corruption cases against him, which alleged he and his two sons embezzled funds for presidential palaces, according to the Associated Press. According to Deeb, the only legal grounds for the ousted president's detention rest on one other corruption case, which is expected to be resolved this week.\n\nIf Mubarak is freed, the reversal will be significant, as Morsi has been held at an undisclosed location since being removed from power. The military removed President Mohamed Mursi, a senior Brotherhood official, on July 3 after mass protests against his rule. Mursi is in detention at an undisclosed location and faces an investigation into accusations, including murder, stemming from his escape from prison during the anti-Mubarak revolt.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe are monitoring the situation and urging calm as the key Middle Eastern nation unravels. The EU plans to meet Wednesday in Brussels to discuss the situation, while President Obama, back from vacation, has urged calm without explicitly taking sides.",
    " Title: Portfolio Manager Sells Junk Bonds in Anticipation of Debt Rally End\n\nArticle:\n\nPilar Gomez-Bravo, a portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management, has reduced her high-yield exposure from as high as 30% in 2016 to 10% in one of her unconstrained funds, which manages $4.5 billion in fixed-income assets. This move comes as the average U.S. high-yield bond spreads have fallen below 375 basis points, a level that in the past has signified negative excess returns in a year's time.\n\nGomez-Bravo, who oversees a slew of global credit funds, sees the current corporate debt rally as potentially overextended, with borrowers still holding the upper hand due to cheap-money policies and low defaults. She believes that the long-bemoaned opacity and leverage of junk issuers are now at a tipping point.\n\nIn Europe, over a third of private high-yield companies restrict access to financial data in some way, according to unspecified analysis earlier this year. Gomez-Bravo argues that buyers should receive extra compensation for firms that curb access to earnings with password-protected sites.\n\nThe speculation of another round of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank is spurring the rally, masking fragile balance sheets. However, leaving the party too early risks leaving profits on the table. Gomez-Bravo is selling into a rising market and taking more political risk by adding to investments in peripheral governments like Greece and Italy.\n\nGomez-Bravo, who was a portfolio manager at Lehman Brothers' investment arm during the 2008 financial crisis, recalls similar signs of a speculative mania before the last bubble. She anticipates real end-of-cycle fears about what will perform in the current market.\n\nWhen Lehman Brothers went bust, Gomez-Bravo was a senior credit analyst on Lehman's sellside but moved in 2006, citing frustration with unchecked animal spirits. Like even outspoken naysayers at the time, she didn't anticipate the violence of the downturn. However, in May 2007, Gomez-Bravo became cautious on U.S. risk and issued warnings on corporate health, which bear echoes with the intense hunt for yield today.",
    " Title: Wisconsin to Hold In-Person Voting Despite Coronavirus Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nWisconsin is set to hold in-person voting next week, as the state's legislature declined to take up an effort to delay the presidential primary due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state's Republican-controlled legislature ended special weekend sessions without taking action on a call by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to make Tuesday's primary an all-mail election and extend the time to return ballots until late May, according to local media outlets.\n\nReid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Election Commission, confirmed to media outlets that the election will proceed as planned, with in-person voting. Leaders in the legislature, which has the sole authority to delay the ballot, criticized Evers for a late reversal on holding voting and stated that the election, which also decides thousands of state and local offices, must go ahead as planned. Legislators could still reconsider in the coming days.\n\nRepublicans also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent the extension of Wisconsin's deadline for absentee voting to April 13, which a federal judge had previously ordered. \"Republicans in the Legislature are playing politics with public safety and ignoring the urgency of this public health crisis,\" Evers said in a statement. \"It's wrong. No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote.\"\n\nResidents in the state are under orders to stay at home and public gatherings are banned due to the pandemic. Fears about infection have led to a shortage of poll workers and an explosion in requests for absentee ballots. Officials in the state have warned of potential chaos if the voting goes ahead.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted the Democratic race to pick a challenger to run against Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, forcing more than a dozen states to delay or adjust their primaries to limit the health risks. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said it is possible to conduct Wisconsin's in-person vote safely. Rival Bernie Sanders, who trails Biden significantly in the race, called for the primary to be postponed.",
    " Title: Amazon Faces Increased Scrutiny Over Workplace Conditions as Free and Fair Markets Initiative Launches Hotline\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Free and Fair Markets Initiative, a nonprofit watchdog, has partnered with former Amazon workers to establish a hotline for reporting unsafe working conditions within Amazon warehouses. The initiative aims to address concerns about Amazon's labor practices, particularly in light of the company's ongoing expansion plans.\n\nIn a statement, the group's chief spokesperson, Robert B. Engel, criticized Amazon for its alleged disregard for worker safety and well-being. \"Amazon grinds its workers until they have nothing left to give,\" Engel said. \"It's time someone did something about it.\"\n\nThe Free and Fair Markets Initiative has been scrutinizing Amazon's practices since its inception last year, focusing on the company's harmful practices, especially in relation to workplace conditions. The National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (NCOSH) has included Amazon on its \"Dirty Dozen\" list for two consecutive years, drawing attention to companies that regularly put employees and communities at risk.\n\nIn its most recent report, NCOSH noted that despite Amazon's vast resources, there is little evidence the company has made a significant effort to address worker complaints about stress, overwork, and other conditions that can lead to illness, injuries, and fatalities. Between October 2013 and 2018, emergency responders were reportedly called to Amazon warehouses at least 189 times for suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and other mental-health episodes, according to a report by The Daily Beast.\n\nThe hotline, which allows workers to report unsafe conditions anonymously, also provides instructions and resources for taking their complaint further by filing with OSHA either online, physically, or over the phone.\n\nA former Hebron, Kentucky warehouse worker, who wished to remain anonymous due to a non-disclosure agreement, is assisting on the hotline. They stated, \"People need to be aware of what's going on inside these warehouses. You're going to need a lot more than just one phone line to hear all these complaints from the workers.\"\n\nIn response, Amazon stated, \"We work hard to provide a safe, quality work environment for our associates, who are encouraged to provide feedback through public and private channels and are always welcome to talk to leaders at their site \u2014 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All of this is on top of our industry-leading $15 minimum wage and comprehensive benefits starting on day one.\" Amazon also emphasized that workers are encouraged to compare their safety record, employer practices, and work conditions with any major employer or retailer.",
    " Title: Oregon Senate Race: Two Republican Candidates Vie for Democratic-Held Seat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing bid by Republicans to gain control of the U.S. Senate, some are targeting an unlikely state: Oregon. The Beaver State has not elected a Republican in a statewide election since 2002. However, the incumbent Senator Jeff Merkley is seen as vulnerable, partly due to his enthusiastic support for ObamaCare in a state that experienced a disastrous rollout of its failed health care exchange, Cover Oregon.\n\nThe Republican primary in Oregon will be held on Tuesday, and it appears to be a two-person race between Dr. Monica Wehby and Jason Conger, two candidates with compelling personal stories who are quite different on social issues.\n\nDr. Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon with 30 years in the field, is the first woman to graduate from UCLA's neurosurgery program. She gained prominence in this race due to her early criticism of ObamaCare. As a member of the American Medical Association's board, she was featured in a 2009 ad opposing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"It's a 2,700 page law, 20,000 pages of regulations now -- it's impossible to work with this law,\" Wehby said. \"I think the best way is to repeal and replace with a plan that will actually work.\"\n\nConger, a two-term representative in the Oregon State House, is also a practicing lawyer. His path to the legal profession was anything but ordinary. His mother abandoned the family when he was young, and he lived with his father, often staying in trailer parks and being homeless, sleeping in the back of his family truck. From those humble beginnings in northern California, he graduated from Harvard Law School.\n\n\"I feel extraordinarily blessed to have been able to go from barely graduating from an alternative high school to graduating from Harvard Law School and living what I would consider the American dream,\" Conger said.\n\nDr. Wehby has been endorsed by GOP heavyweights like Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Dr. Ben Carson. She also received a major boost in the form of a $400,000 advertising campaign funded by the New Republican super PAC. The group's ads highlight Wehby's credibility on ObamaCare, her sensitivity to issues important to women, and her professional background.\n\nConger has raised far less money and polls suggest he's trailing. However, he does have plenty of support, especially from social conservatives. Oregon Right to Life endorsed his candidacy, and former presidential candidate Rick Santorum recently endorsed him in a radio ad. Conger also has wide support among Republican lawmakers in Oregon. He is strong on the Second Amendment, is staunchly pro-life, and opposes gay marriage.\n\nWehby, who was raised Catholic, says she is personally pro-life, but would not work to take away abortion rights for other women. She is divorced with four teenage children. She says she is not opposed to gay marriage. She believes the GOP can grow if it becomes a little more libertarian on social issues.\n\n\"We don't want the government interfering in our business, in our personal lives, in our private lives, in our personal decisions,\" Wehby said. \"As Republicans, we want as little government interference in our lives as possible.\"\n\nThe Republicans have been on a losing streak in Oregon ever since Merkley defeated Gordon Smith in 2002. Mike Riley, of the Portland political consulting firm Riley Research, said gender politics do matter in the state.\n\n\"Republican men, particularly senior Republican men, have a very hard time attracting votes in Oregon, among Democrats, of course, but independent women as well,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Conger believes moving to the center is the wrong strategy.\n\n\"You don't have to be moderate, you don't have to abandon your principles,\" he said. \"You have to offer an alternative to voters to the incumbent, an alternative that is more attractive, that is credible and speaks to issues that they care about.\"\n\nWehby might carry some baggage into the general election if she wins the primary. A number of recent stories raise questions about her relationship with a Republican donor who runs a large Oregon lumber company. Andrew Miller, owner of Stimson Lumber, donated $31,000 to a super PAC that helped fund ads attacking Conger. It's been widely reported that Miller and Wehby dated. The Oregon Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging there must have been coordination between Miller and the Wehby campaign, which would have made the donation a violation of campaign finance laws. Wehby told Fox News there was no coordination.\n\nPolitico is also reporting Miller accused Wehby of stalking him and harassing his employees as the couple was breaking up in 2013. No charges or restraining orders were ever filed.",
    " Title: New Center's Comprehensive Immigration Reform Proposal Faces Timing and Sequencing Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nA new comprehensive immigration reform proposal, spearheaded by the New Center, a bipartisan think tank, has been introduced, offering an opportunity to review the current state of immigration policy in the United States. The proposal, which faces challenges in terms of timing and sequencing, suggests a shift from a family-based legal immigration system to a merit-based one, prioritizing factors such as education, work experience, job offers, and English skills.\n\nThe plan offers legal status and permanent residency after ten years to individuals who have resided in the U.S. continuously since the end of 2011, have paid application fees and back taxes, and have clean criminal records. \"Dreamers\" who arrived as minors and have not committed felonies would receive green cards immediately. The proposal also includes increased border security, advanced technology for tracking temporary visa holders, and a mandate for the use of E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check whether job applicants are in the country legally.\n\nHowever, the plan's timing and the sequence of policy implementation have become contentious issues. Conservatives have long advocated for \"enforcement first,\" insisting on demonstrating border control, visa overstay enforcement, and employer sanctions before any amnesty is granted. The New Center plan, on the other hand, does not delay amnesty and instead mandates that E-Verify not be implemented until everyone has had a chance to apply for legal status. This sequencing could potentially weaken conservative leverage to ensure the vigorous implementation of enforcement measures promised after amnesty.\n\nIf enacted, the plan may face opposition from both sides, rather than being the result of a bipartisan agreement. The success of comprehensive immigration reform may hinge on finding a compromise on the timing and sequencing of policy implementation, as one side may have to accept a loss in order for a deal to be reached.",
    " Title: Roy Moore's Senate Bid: A Look at the Former Alabama Chief Justice's Path to a Primary Runoff\n\nArticle:\n\nAfter winning the U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in 2017, Roy Moore's political career seemed to come to a halt following allegations of unwanted sexual contact with teenage girls. However, Moore has announced his bid for the Senate again, and his new campaign cannot be entirely dismissed. Despite President Trump's disapproval, Moore still has a dedicated base of support, particularly among conservative evangelical Christians.\n\nAs of now, there are four notable candidates running, with a fifth set to join the race. According to two early surveys of the Republican primary field, Moore could earn support from 18 to 27 percent of the primary electorate. However, it remains unclear how much Moore can raise his ceiling of potential support, as many in his own party have a negative opinion of him.\n\nOne factor working in Moore's favor is a crowded primary field. With Alabama being 27 points more Republican than the country as a whole, the eventual GOP nominee stands a good chance of beating the incumbent, Doug Jones, in the general election. A large primary field may fragment the vote, making it unlikely that a candidate could win a majority and avoiding a runoff, making it easier for Moore to advance to a runoff with only the support of his base.\n\nRep. Bradley Byrne and Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, are the major contenders so far. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill is also gearing up to run, and State Rep. Arnold Mooney has received an endorsement from the Senate Conservatives Fund. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is also a possibility for running for his old seat and potentially clearing the field.\n\nIf Moore does finish in the top two in the primary and makes it to a runoff, it would still be challenging for him to clinch the GOP nomination. However, some of Moore's major opponents have potential weaknesses. Tuberville, a political outsider, might face \"carpetbagger\" attacks due to voting in Florida just last November. Byrne, the current establishment favorite, had difficulty in past primary battles and was critical of Trump in the 2016 cycle, although he did support the GOP ticket in the end.\n\nIn conclusion, Moore does have a path, especially a path to a primary runoff if there's a crowded GOP field. If he does get there, he would be only one step away from a rematch with Jones. National Republicans may have an \"Anyone But Moore\" attitude, and GOP groups would undoubtedly pound Moore with negative ads. However, a Trump endorsement of Moore's opponent in 2017 could not stop him from winning, so it's not impossible that Moore does end up winning his party's nomination.",
    " Title: Quadcopter Crashes on White House Grounds, Secret Service Investigating\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Secret Service has identified a device found on the White House grounds overnight as a \"quadcopter.\" The agency reported that the operator of the device lost control, causing it to crash.\n\nIn a statement released Monday afternoon, the Secret Service stated that an individual called around 9:30 a.m. ET to \"self-report\" the crashed copter. The agency added that the individual has been cooperative, and the incident appears to stem from recreational use of the device.\n\nAccording to the Secret Service, an on-duty officer saw and heard the 2-foot-wide commercial quadcopter fly low onto the grounds of the executive mansion at approximately 3:08 a.m. ET. The quadcopter crashed on the southeast side, the agency said in a statement.\n\n\"There was an immediate alert and lockdown of the complex until the device was examined and cleared,\" a spokesman said, adding that an investigation is underway.\n\nEarlier, the White House stated that the device posed no threat to the first family. President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are in India; their daughters, Sasha and Malia, stayed behind in Washington with their grandmother, Marian Robinson.\n\n\"There is a device that has been recovered by the Secret Service at the White House,\" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, who is with Obama in New Delhi. \"The early indications are that it does not pose any sort of ongoing threat to anybody at the White House.\"\n\nDrones, as previously reported, come in a variety of sizes and are used in counterterrorism, surveillance, aerial photography, and even as toys.\n\nThis incident follows a series of security lapses at the White House for which the Secret Service has been widely criticized. As previously reported:\n\n\"The Secret Service was criticized last year after several lapses, including one in which a knife-wielding man scaled the White House fence and made it inside the executive mansion's main level. The scandal resulted in the resignation of its then-director, Julia Pierson.

Sekulow described the appeals court's decision as raising significant constitutional issues.\n\nThe subpoena for the tax records is directed to Trump's accountants, not the president himself, and the appeals court's ruling does not address the question of presidential immunity. In a statement, Judge Robert Katzman, who wrote on behalf of the three-judge panel, noted that compliance with the subpoena does not require the president to take any action.\n\nThe investigation by Vance's office is focused on whether any New York state laws were broken when Trump's then-attorney, Michael Cohen, arranged payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the closing weeks of the 2016 election. Trump has denied having sexual relationships with both women.\n\nIn addition to this legal battle, Trump is also fighting efforts by the House of Representatives to obtain his tax records. Unlike other past presidents, Trump has not divested from his business interests while in office. As a candidate and as president, Trump has chosen not to make his tax returns public.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Bill to Combat Rape Kit Backlog, Providing Funding for Testing and Training\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019 on Monday, a bill aimed at reducing the number of untested rape kits in the United States. The legislation will provide funding from the Department of Justice to help local governments clear the backlog of untested rape kits, which currently exceeds 100,000, according to ABC News.\n\nThe White House stated that the bill, as per a statement from press secretary Stephanie Grisham, will ensure that \"criminals are brought to justice.\" Grisham's statement read, \"We know that DNA is much more likely than fingerprints to result in the identification of a criminal, yet thousands of rape kits currently sit untested in labs and on police storage shelves across the Nation.\"\n\nThe bill will allocate $151 million to the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, $12.5 million for DNA training and education programs, and $30 million for the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Grant Program, according to ABC News. The bill, originally passed in 2004, is named after a victim who was attacked in 1989, and whose evidence wasn't tested until five years later. Since 2005, it has led to more than 40 percent of DNA matches due to its funding, the network reported.\n\nAdvocates argue that fighting the backlog is crucial due to the statute of limitations in some jurisdictions. The funding for the bill traditionally has bipartisan support but got caught in the middle of the debate surrounding the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act this year, according to ABC News.",
    " Title: House Democrats Express Concerns Over Emergency Aid Package for Border Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for passing a funding bill approaches, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated that the bill under consideration reflects Democratic values but expressed concern about the limited time remaining. The statement came after President Donald Trump's decision to suspend Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids for two weeks to facilitate a bipartisan compromise on changing asylum laws and closing immigration \"loopholes.\"\n\nPelosi praised the postponement and, in a subsequent statement, called for the passage of the emergency aid package. She argued that the bill protects families and does not fund the administration's failed mass detention policy. The bill, however, would not meet Trump's demands for changes to asylum laws.\n\nDespite Pelosi's efforts to advance the bill, numerous House Democrats have expressed concerns. In separate conference calls on Sunday, more than 30 members of the Progressive Caucus and over 15 members of the Hispanic Caucus voiced their apprehensions. Many argued that the legislation did not set high enough standards for migrant shelters or do enough to block funds from being used for enforcement.\n\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington and co-chairwoman of the Progressive Caucus, stated, \"We all want to address the problems at the border, but we don't know that there are enough sticks in this bill to make sure that the Trump administration actually spends the money the way they're supposed to.\" Jayapal added, \"He's creating these crises and then trying to point a finger at Democrats to give him more money, which he then uses for his own purposes.\"\n\nJayapal expressed doubt that the Trump administration would adhere to any restrictions or standards included in the legislation, given its \"lawless\" behavior regarding immigrants.

The documents allegedly reveal that Russian agents attempted to hack into U.S. voting systems prior to the November election.\n\nWinner, a former U.S. Air Force linguist who speaks Pashto, Farsi, and Dari, was indicted in federal court on Monday. According to the federal complaint, Winner stole the classified documents from Pluribus International, a defense contractor that does work for the National Security Agency (NSA) from its offices in Augusta, Ga.\n\nWinner admitted to FBI agents that she stole the documents and provided them to The Intercept. The news site published an article on Monday that appears to be based on the stolen materials.\n\nThe federal complaint filed against Winner reveals that she stole the classified documents on May 9, four days after they were published by the NSA. She printed the report and sent it through ground mail to The Intercept. On May 30, a reporter with the outlet contacted the NSA inquiring about the documents. The agency then contacted the FBI, which dispatched agents to interview and apprehend Winner at her home in Augusta.\n\nWinner's social media footprint suggests that she is politically active. On February 14, a day after Winner took her Top Secret job at Pluribus, Winner posted a photo outside of the Atlanta offices of Georgia Sen. David Perdue. She wrote that she had a 30-minute private meeting with the Republican lawmaker's state policy director, discussing her concerns regarding climate change and the state of Georgia's efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.\n\nWinner's posts on Facebook also show that she is a supporter of liberal causes, including the Women's March and the Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim civil rights group. She referred to President Trump as a \"piece of shit\" because of his position on the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests.\n\nJon Swaine, a reporter with The Guardian, also identified Winner. A spokeswoman for Perdue released a statement on Tuesday calling the allegations against Winner \"very serious.\"\n\n\"The allegations against Ms. Winner are very serious, and if true, directly threaten our national security. We trust our Justice Department will get to the bottom of this and handle it appropriately,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nWinner was heavily critical of Trump just after he took office, using the hashtags \"#NeverMyPresident\" and \"#Resist\" in a Facebook post about his position on DAPL. Winner posted on Facebook most recently on Friday, the day before she was interviewed by the FBI.\n\n\"You are what you love, not who loves you,\" she wrote.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information, including about Winner's meeting in February at the offices of Georgia Sen.

    " Title: House Votes to Hold Lois Lerner in Contempt of Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has voted to hold Lois Lerner, the former head of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax-exempt division, in contempt of Congress. The vote took place three days before the anniversary of the day Lerner's actions ignited the tea party targeting controversy.\n\nThe Republican-led chamber voted 231-187 to hold Lerner in contempt for refusing to answer House Republicans' questions. Six Democrats joined the Republicans in the vote.\n\n\"You don't get to use a public hearing to tell the public and press your side of the story and then invoke the Fifth,\" said Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) on the House floor. \"That is not how the Fifth Amendment is meant to be used. It is a shield; Lois Lerner used it as a sword.\"\n\nDemocrats dismissed the process as a political move designed for election season. \"Bringing this political circus, this witch hunt to the floor purely because it polls well with your base is ludicrous,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.).\n\nLerner's lawyer, William Taylor, said in a statement that \"it is unfortunate that the majority party in the House has put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights.\" Lerner has stated that she has broken no laws.\n\nThe contempt citation now goes to the Justice Department, where the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia could bring the issue to court. The department has not responded to a request for comment on whether it will proceed with the case.\n\nIn a separate measure, the House called on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special counsel to probe the matter. If tried and found guilty, Lerner could serve up to a year in prison or face a fine of up to $100,000, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nThe contempt charge allows the House to arrest Lerner and detain her in a Capitol jail cell until she complies with the subpoena or until the end of the 113th Congress\u2014a power not exercised since the early 20th century.\n\nLerner is known for the IRS's practice of pulling conservative groups applying for exemptions for additional scrutiny if they used words like tea party, patriot, and 9/12 in their applications.\n\nHouse Republicans have chosen to forgo any civil contempt citation against Lerner, a strategy that, if won, would force her to testify before the House. This strategy has confused some lawyers.\n\nThe contempt citation does not necessarily mark the end of the IRS scandal, with nearly a half-dozen congressional investigations expected to wrap up in the coming months. However, a criminal contempt conviction, if upheld in court, will not require Lerner to testify.\n\nAt one point, the Oversight Committee and Lerner's lawyer, William Taylor III, were close to a deal allowing Lerner to testify without immunity in public, but the agreement fell through. Since Lerner broke news of the practice following a planted question at a May 10, 2013, legal conference, she has become the target of Republican scorn.\n\nInitially, Republicans looked to the White House, equating the scandal to Watergate and calling it a scheme by President Barack Obama to target his enemies. However, when no smoking gun appeared, they toned down that rhetoric. The Treasury inspector general for tax administration, in the first official report on the scandal, attributed the unfair practice to gross mismanagement\u2014not political bias.\n\nSince then, House Republicans have built a case around Lerner, accusing her of using her top IRS position for political mischief.",

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC have been making this argument to major donors, with the National Republican Congressional Committee making a similar case to their own donors.\n\nJohn Podesta, senior White House counselor and expected to have the top position in Clinton's presumptive campaign, has already met with a small group of labor leaders to keep donations coming in for the fall. The pitch is not just about holding on for 2016, but also about the potential benefits of a Democratic House in the days following the inauguration.\n\nAli Lapp, who runs the House Majority PAC, stated, \"So many of our donors and our activists are really, really excited about Hillary running for president. The thing we have to say to them is, \u2018We are too, but let's think about all the days that follow the inauguration and what she'll be able to do with a Democratic House versus the Republican House we have now.'\"\n\nRep. Steve Israel of New York, DCCC Chairman, added, \"It's safe to say that there's a lot of enthusiasm among Democrats around the country for the prospect of a Hillary Clinton candidacy, and that unquestionably factors into many donors' decision making.\"\n\nWhile the DCCC and House Majority PAC are not guaranteeing a majority for the Democrats, they are emphasizing the importance of maintaining and expanding their current seats to create a more effective legislative body for Clinton's presidency. A senior Democrat stated, \"It's clear that she's so potent and demands the respect of the donor community around the country.\"\n\nDonors who have dealt extensively with House Majority PAC described the message as \"Keep the flame alive.\" One donor explained, \"They're not going to win a majority; they still need to hold onto what seats they can and be competitive heading into a presidential year.\"",
    " Title: Examination of White Privilege and Racial Stereotypes in America\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the concept of white privilege and the perpetuation of racial stereotypes about African Americans in American society. It begins by describing white privilege as a metaphorical pair of binoculars that allow white individuals to view black life from a distance, without intimate understanding.\n\nThe text suggests that these binoculars are not only physical objects but also stories and beliefs that portray black people as lazy, dumb, or immoral. These beliefs are not typically found in contemporary books or classrooms but are informally passed down from one white individual to another.\n\nThe article further discusses the reluctance of many white individuals to learn about the hardships faced by African Americans, often attributing their success to undeserved advantages. The author criticizes this mindset, suggesting that it stems from a belief that resources and opportunities should be prioritized for white individuals.\n\nThe article also touches upon the resentment and slow-building hate that some white individuals feel due to their perceived loss of privilege, which they often project onto political figures who amplify their prejudiced thoughts.\n\nThe text also addresses the terror experienced by African Americans, citing instances of police brutality and the fear it instills in the community. The author suggests that this fear is not unfamiliar to African Americans, as they are often targeted by law enforcement for minor infractions or perceived discomfort.\n\nFinally, the article mentions the hypocrisy of holding entire populations accountable for the actions of a few, as is often the case with the stereotyping of Muslims, while white individuals rarely take responsibility for their own prejudices. The article concludes by urging white individuals to put down their \"binoculars\" and see the world from the perspective of African Americans.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke's Authenticity: A Key Factor in 2020 Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the crowded 2020 Democratic primary, one candidate stands out for his authenticity: Beto O'Rourke. This quality, some argue, could potentially propel him to the nomination.\n\nWhile Donald Trump's authenticity has been a subject of debate, it has enabled him to connect with people, as evidenced by his victory in the 2016 presidential election against Hillary Clinton. Similarly, Beto O'Rourke's authenticity could be a significant factor in his political success.\n\nIn a critical op-ed published a few weeks ago, the author expressed concerns about O'Rourke's performance in 2019, citing his lack of focus on traditional campaign activities such as fundraising, hiring staff, and meeting voters. However, the author also acknowledges O'Rourke's natural political ability and his potential to unite the Obama coalition, a feat that has been challenging for other candidates in the primary field.\n\nO'Rourke's authenticity is not about sharing personal details on social media or writing lengthy blog posts about road trips. Instead, it is about his ability to connect with people on a personal level, as demonstrated by his openness, his liberal political stance, and his willingness to take far-left positions in a red state.\n\nThe challenge for O'Rourke lies in learning from his mistakes and capitalizing on his political ability to unite the Obama coalition, a group that includes minority voters, white liberals, and young people. Out of the entire field, O'Rourke has the best shot at achieving this, as other candidates, such as Kirsten Gillibrand and Joe Biden, will have to address their more moderate pasts and long histories in Congress.\n\nWhile Kamala Harris has struggled to come across as authentic during her early state trips, O'Rourke seems to avoid these problems, presenting himself as genuine and unfiltered. What you see is what you get, and that authenticity could take him farther than many expect.",
    " Title: Former Biden Staffer Files Criminal Complaint Against Joe Biden for Alleged Assault\n\nArticle:\n\nA former staffer for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has filed a formal criminal complaint against him with the Washington, D.C. police, alleging sexual assault in 1993. Tara Reade, who made the allegations last month, told police that Biden \"assaulted her in a Senate corridor, shoving his hand under her skirt and penetrating her with his fingers,\" according to Business Insider's report on Saturday. The statute of limitations for the alleged assault has passed.\n\nReade initially shared her allegations last month with writer and podcast host Katie Halper, stating, \"This is a story that @ReadeAlexandra has been trying to tell since it happened in 1993. It\u2019s a story about sexual assault, retaliation, and silencing.\"\n\nIn her conversation with Halper, Reade described the alleged incident, saying, \"We were alone, and it was the strangest thing. There was no, like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall. His hands were on me and underneath my clothes. And then, he went, he went down my skirt and then up inside it, and he penetrated me with his fingers...and um...He was kissing me at the same time and he was saying something to me.\"\n\nReade continued, \"He got finished doing what he was doing and I, how I was pulled back and he said, \u2018Come on man, I heard you liked me.\u2019 And that phrase stayed with me because I kept thinking what I might have said. I can\u2019t remember exactly if he said \u2018I thought\u2019 or if \u2018I heard.\u2019 It\u2019s like he implied that I had done this.\"\n\nBiden's campaign has vehemently denied the allegation. In a statement to Fox News, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said, \"Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.\" (RELATED: Alyssa Milano Says Joe Biden Deserves 'Due Process' in Sexual Assault Allegation)",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Endorses Ted Cruz in 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who suspended his presidential bid in February following several primary losses, endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz on Wednesday. Despite Bush's frequent criticisms of Cruz during the campaign and his perceived alignment with Ohio Governor John Kasich, Bush endorsed Cruz, stating that he is a \"consistent, principled conservative who has demonstrated the ability to appeal to voters.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday, Trump leads the race with 739 delegates, followed by Cruz with 465, and Kasich with 143, according to the Associated Press. A candidate needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright at the convention. With his current standing, Trump appears to be the only candidate capable of reaching this number. Cruz, according to polls, has the best chance of beating Trump one-on-one and preventing Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegate threshold.\n\nBush's endorsement is the latest sign that the so-called Republican establishment is coalescing around Cruz's campaign. If neither candidate manages to reach 1,237 delegates, the two candidates will head into a contested convention where delegates will be free to vote with their conscience. Bush's tweet announcing his endorsement reads, \"I am endorsing @ TedCruz. Ted is a consistent, principled conservative who has shown he can unite the party.\"",
    " Title: Lawyers for President Trump Seek $20 Million in Damages from Stormy Daniels for Alleged Breach of Non-Disclosure Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nLawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump are pursuing $20 million in damages from adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, for allegedly breaching a non-disclosure agreement signed before the 2016 elections. The lawyers argue that Daniels breached the agreement at least 20 times.\n\nDaniels claims she had an affair with Mr. Trump that began in 2006 and lasted several months. The president's lawyer, Michael Cohen, has stated that he paid Daniels $130,000 of his own money to remain silent about the alleged affair. This is the first time President Trump has become directly involved in the case. He \"vehemently denies\" the alleged affair.\n\nThis month, a lawsuit was filed by Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, aiming to scrap the non-disclosure agreement. Avenatti described the filing by the law firm representing the president as \"unprecedented\" and \"yet another bullying tactic\" against Daniels. The filing also sought a change of venue from state to federal court.\n\nDaniels asserts that the 2016 agreement is invalid as Mr. Trump did not sign it. She first made claims of a sexual relationship with Mr. Trump in a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine. The story resurfaced earlier this year when reports emerged she was paid not to discuss the alleged affair in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nCohen has acknowledged paying Daniels $130,000 privately, but stated neither Mr. Trump nor his company was a party to the transaction. A similar request made on Mr. Trump's behalf came from another lawyer, Charles Harder - best known for his handling of the Hulk Hogan sex tape case against Gawker and for defending Melania Trump in a suit against the Daily Mail.\n\nThe motion filed on Mr. Trump's behalf states, \"Mr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by the law.\" It is thought that moving the case to a federal court would help keep the case behind closed doors in arbitration, a view expressed by Daniels' lawyer in a tweet.\n\nMr. Avenatti alleged on Friday that Daniels had been physically threatened, but did not provide further details. Daniels has recorded an interview with the CBS network's 60 Minutes program to air later this month about her fight to void the agreement. A CrowdJustice campaign to raise funds for her legal fees has already raised almost $200,000.\n\nMr. Trump has also obtained a restraining order against Daniels to try to prevent her from sharing \"confidential information\" about their alleged relationship.",
    " Title: Advocacy Groups Sue Georgia Over Voting Registration Law\n\nArticle:\n\nA coalition of advocacy groups, including the Campaign Legal Center and Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, has filed a lawsuit to prevent Georgia from enforcing a voting registration law that critics argue disenfranchises over 50,000 voters. The lawsuit, filed in a federal district court on Thursday, alleges that the state's \"exact match\" requirement violates the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe \"exact match\" system, used by the state's Secretary of State from 2013 to 2016, was halted in 2017 as part of a settlement stemming from separate litigation. However, the Republican-held state legislature passed the protocol into law soon after. According to a recent Associated Press report, around 53,000 people, nearly 70% of whom are African-Americans, had their registrations placed on hold due to mismatches in drivers' license or social security information.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is currently running for governor in a closely contested race with Democratic former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, stated in a tweet, \"The 53,000 Georgians on our 'pending' list can vote in the Nov. 6th election.\"\n\nIn response to the AP report, the Abrams campaign called for Kemp to resign as the state's top elections official to ensure Georgia voters have confidence that their Secretary of State will competently and impartially oversee the election.\n\nThe lawsuit, initially threatened in July, has no connection to the campaign. The plaintiffs argue that the controversial \"exact match\" checks have disproportionately and negatively impacted the ability of voting-eligible African-American, Latino, and Asian-American applicants, even before the process was signed into law by the current governor, Republican Nathan Deal, in 2017.",
    " Title: Weakness in American Leadership: Syria Crisis Highlights Decay of Party Discipline and Media Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Syria crisis has become a significant moment in modern presidential history, with the United States' response to the conflict revealing weaknesses in multiple institutions and leaders. The unsteady handling of the Syria crisis by President Barack Obama has been particularly noteworthy, highlighting his uncertain views and limited options.\n\nHowever, the focus on Obama's performance has overshadowed a larger reality: the Syria episode has exposed the decay of party discipline and the diminishment of the parties in American politics. The inability of the president and congressional leaders to garner enough support for authorizing force in Syria, particularly in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons, underscores this weakness.\n\nHistorically, party discipline has been a defining characteristic of American politics. In the Iraq War, only six Republicans in Congress voted against President George W. Bush's request for authorization. In contrast, President Obama has lost two Democrats in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee alone, with additional opposition from other members.\n\nThe decay of party discipline is a result of the rise of outside groups and politicians who do not depend on their parties for money and influence. This reality is the main reason Washington has been paralyzed in recent years, with neither House Speaker John Boehner nor Obama having the confidence to bring their parties along on deals over budget, entitlements, or other domestic issues.\n\nIn response to this reality, party leaders have emphasized their lack of leverage in pressing for passage of the White House-backed resolution. \"It's not a question of whipping,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week. After House Speaker John Boehner endorsed the Syria resolution, his spokesman declared that the president should take the lead on any whipping effort.\n\nIn other words, good luck with all that, Mr. President.\n\nThe Syria crisis also highlights the changing media landscape. Presidents have traditionally relied on their power to make everyone stop and pay attention. However, the media landscape has fractured, and presidents can no longer command universal interest or attention from the American people. President Obama has only addressed the nation twice from the Oval Office, a stark contrast to his predecessors.\n\nIn his political campaigns, Obama has attempted to counteract the fracturing of the media landscape by speaking in unconventional venues. However, this approach has its limits, and moving mass opinion on a serious matter in a short period of time is challenging.\n\nPresident Obama faces a potentially public display of this media schizophrenia Tuesday with the prospect that his speech making the case for punishing Syria could take place simultaneously with coverage of Russia's efforts to broker a diplomatic end game. The president acknowledged Monday that these efforts might lead him to call the whole thing off.",
    " Title: Federal Government Implementing Supreme Court Ruling on Same-Sex Marriage\n\nArticle:\n\nFour months have passed since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, paving the way for thousands of same-sex married couples to receive federal benefits. A special group of government lawyers has been working to ensure that these benefits are extended to same-sex couples.\n\nThe task was clear: review over 1,000 rules and laws that cover various federal benefits to make sure gay and lesbian couples receive their due. This initiative was prompted by President Obama's instructions issued hours after the high court's decision.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder described this as a civil rights matter, comparing it to the struggle African-Americans faced in the 1950s and 1960s for equal treatment. Federal employees in same-sex marriages can now extend health and life insurance coverage to their spouses, and immigration authorities are reviewing petitions from same-sex couples in the same manner as opposite-sex couples. At the IRS, tax officials say legally married gay and lesbian couples can now file jointly.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Stuart Delery, who leads the effort to implement the Supreme Court ruling for the Justice Department, stated, \"Our job has been to make the promise of that decision, the words on the page in the Supreme Court's opinion, real for real people.\"\n\nHowever, there are still challenges in extending benefits to same-sex couples who live in states that do not recognize their marriages. The Supreme Court struck down the part of the law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman, but it did not create a universal right to marry. This leaves open the question of what happens to same-sex couples who live in states that do not recognize their marriages.\n\nAssociate Attorney General Tony West mentioned that many of the legal issues the Justice Department has faced were relatively straightforward, but there are harder questions, such as whether the place of domicile or the place of celebration is the key factor in determining spousal benefits.\n\nAdvocates are still anxiously waiting for answers on Social Security and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Ultimately, Congress may need to change the language in those laws to fully extend benefits to married couples who live in states that do not recognize their marriages.\n\nIn some cases, same-sex couples have been forced to travel to federal facilities, sometimes long distances, to enroll in federal benefit programs for National Guard members. This situation has been met with criticism, as these are federal benefits programs that are funded with federal money and run by the federal government.\n\nJustice Department officials say the Supreme Court has spoken, and history is on the side of same-sex couples. However, there has been some pushback from states, particularly in the areas of Medicaid enrollment, tax time, and states where gay marriage is outlawed.\n\nDespite these challenges, Attorney General Eric Holder expressed optimism, stating, \"I would hope their elected representatives could reflect the magnanimity of the American people.\"",
    " Title: Analysis of Hillary Clinton's Performance in the 2016 Presidential Election Using VAR Metric\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to Inside Elections' 'Vote Above Replacement' (VAR) metric, Hillary Clinton overperformed a typical Democratic candidate in 19 states during the 2016 presidential race, while Donald Trump overperformed a typical Republican candidate in 15 states. The VAR metric measures the strength of a political candidate relative to a typical candidate from the same party by comparing the percentage of the candidate's vote to the party's Baseline, which is the trimmed mean of each party's performance in partisan, contested statewide elections over the four most recent general election cycles.\n\nClinton underperformed in key states, such as Michigan (-0.2 VAR), New Hampshire (-2.5), Pennsylvania (-3.3), and Wisconsin (-0.9). Losing three (and nearly four) of these states prevented her from securing the presidency. She also underperformed in Minnesota (-4.1) and came close to losing that state as well.\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton overperformed in states like California (+6 VAR), Illinois (+3.1), and Massachusetts (+2.5). This overperformance in Democratic states has led some to argue that Democrats are \"wasting\" votes by running up the score in these states and not changing the math of the Electoral College.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad news for Democrats. Clinton overperformed in Florida (+4.2 VAR), a perennial battleground state, and in the former battleground state of Nevada (+2.8). The emerging battleground state of Maine also showed positive results for Democrats, with Clinton's VAR at +3.1.\n\nThe best news for Democrats might be in growing states where Clinton overperformed and Trump underperformed, such as Texas (Clinton +5.1, Trump -5.8) and Georgia (Clinton +3.1, Trump -4.3).\n\nDavid Wasserman of the Cook Political Report has noted that Trump could lose the popular vote by 5 million votes and still win re-election. This underscores the importance of focusing on key states in future elections.",
    " Title: Democrats Break Tradition, Counter RNC with High-Profile Visits and Speeches\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the Republican National Convention (RNC) next week, the Democratic Party is deviating from tradition by actively engaging in counter-programming, dispatching high-profile figures to Tampa and other cities to deliver speeches and campaign messages.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who was initially scheduled to visit Tampa for the RNC's opening day, has postponed his trip due to inclement weather. Instead, he will join Hollywood actress and Obama for America co-chairwoman Eva Longoria in Orlando, where he is also expected to speak. Longoria is also slated to speak at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) the following week in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nMeanwhile, President Barack Obama has scheduled campaign stops in the battleground states of Ohio, Colorado, and Virginia on Tuesday and Wednesday. First lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to appear on \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" on Wednesday, hours after GOP vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is expected to deliver his speech.\n\nThis concerted effort by the Democrats aims to ensure their message is not overshadowed during the tightening presidential race, as noted by Christopher Arterton, former dean of the George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. Arterton stated, \"Decorum has broken down. It's accepted practice now. We may well see each party make news during the other's convention.\"\n\nArterton explained that Obama's status as president makes his statements newsworthy, making it easier for the Democrats to intrude, particularly after a news event \"like a hurricane, just suppose,\" he said. Arterton also noted that convention week is beneficial for rival-party fundraising, as campaigns can gather donors to \"yell at the TV\" while the other convention is being broadcast.\n\nPresidential candidates have historically kept a low profile during their opponents' conventions, but this practice has changed in recent years. During the 2008 RNC, for example, Obama campaigned in Ohio and Pennsylvania while Biden courted voters in Florida and Virginia.\n\nRomney campaign officials have announced that their candidate will hold events in Charlotte during the week of the DNC, though specific details have not been released. Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki described Biden's visit to Tampa as \"going to the belly of the beast.\" Romney senior adviser Kevin Madden characterized the Biden trip as an attempt to distract from the Democrats' economic record and to draw a contrast between the parties' visions for the country.",
    " Title: Climate Change and Hurricane Harvey: A Debate on the Role of Global Warming\n\nArticle:\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that made landfall in Corpus Christi, Texas, on August 25, 2017, has sparked a debate on the role of climate change in the storm's intensity and impact. The storm brought catastrophic flooding and an unprecedented 50 inches of rain in the Houston area by Tuesday, as it stalled over the region.\n\nClimate activists and scientists, such as meteorologist and climate activist Eric Holthaus, the Climate Reality Project, and 350.org, have argued that climate change exacerbates hurricanes, making them more devastating. Michael E. Mann, a Penn State professor of atmospheric science, stated that while Hurricane Harvey was not caused by climate change, it was worsened by it.\n\nHowever, some scientists, such as Judith Curry, a climatologist and retired Georgia Tech professor, and Roger Pielke Jr., a professor at the University of Colorado Center for Science & Technology Policy Research, have challenged these claims. Curry argued that linking Harvey to global warming is unwarranted, while Pielke pointed out that there were only four U.S. landfalls of Category 4 or greater hurricanes from 1970 to 2017, despite rising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.\n\nRoger Pielke Jr. also noted that there were 14 U.S. landfalls of Category 4 or greater hurricanes from 1926 to 1969, but only four from 1970 to 2017. He suggested that the low number of hurricanes during the Obama administration was due to luck rather than climate change.\n\nAssessments by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others suggest that rising sea levels and surface temperatures create more moisture in the atmosphere, which can lead to greater rainfalls and flooding. However, the role of climate change in specific weather events is complex and not always straightforward.\n\nRoy W. Spencer, principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, disagreed with the assertion that global warming may explain why Hurricane Harvey stalled over Southeast Texas, producing record rainfall. Spencer argued that the flooding disaster in Houston was the result of a combination of factors that can be explained naturally, without invoking human-caused climate change.\n\nThe National Weather Service reported that Harvey produced more than 50 inches of rain in Cedar Bayou, Texas, surpassing the measured single-storm rainfall record for the continental United States. However, Spencer noted that if the system had been moving a little faster, it would have dispersed the rainfall over a wider area and missed the record despite producing the same amount of precipitation.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate on the role of climate change in Hurricane Harvey's intensity and impact is ongoing, with some scientists arguing that climate change exacerbates hurricanes, while others suggest that the storm's characteristics can be explained naturally. The National Weather Service has reported that Harvey produced unprecedented rainfall, but whether this represents a new normal or a rare combination of events remains to be determined.",
    " Title: South Carolina Governor Calls for Removal of Confederate Flag from State Capitol, Retailers Ban Sale of Confederate Merchandise\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a mass shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, Governor Nikki Haley called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capitol grounds on June 22. The call for the flag's removal has gained support from leaders around the state and the country.\n\nDuring a news conference attended by Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, along with other state leaders, Haley stated, \"Today, we are here in a moment of unity in our state, without ill will, to say it is time to move the flag from the Capitol grounds.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting, several retailers, including Walmart, Amazon, Sears, and eBay, announced they will ban the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. The announcements are the latest indication that the flag, a symbol of the slave-holding South, has become increasingly controversial in the wake of the attack.\n\nThe debate over the use of the Confederate flag has intensified, with some viewing it as a symbol of hate and others seeing it as a representation of bravery from the Civil War. Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asserted that the flag \"represents bravery\" to some, while others, such as The Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, accused liberals of \"expunging every trace of respect, recognition or acknowledgment of Americans who fought for the Confederacy.\"\n\nFox News' Kimberly Guilfoyle and Rush Limbaugh have also weighed in on the issue, with Guilfoyle asking during a June 23 edition of Fox News' The Five, \"Is the American flag next?\" and Limbaugh claiming that liberals' true mission in removing the Confederate flag is \"destroying the South as a political force.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Confederate flag continues to divide opinions, with some viewing it as a symbol of hate and others as a representation of history and bravery. The debate is likely to continue as the nation grapples with the complex and controversial history of the flag.",
    " Title: Trump May Not Insist on Border Wall Funding in DACA Legislation, According to White House Aide\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump may not demand funding for a border wall with Mexico in legislation addressing protections for children brought to the United States illegally, according to a senior aide. White House legislative director Marc Short stated this during a Tuesday briefing with reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast.\n\nShort clarified that the administration will outline its priorities for a DACA program fix in the coming weeks. While Trump remains committed to his campaign promise to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Short expressed that the specific inclusion of the border wall in a DACA package or a separate legislative package has not been decided.\n\nShort emphasized, \"I don't want to bind ourselves into a construct that makes reaching a conclusion on DACA impossible.\" He added, \"I don't want to prejudge here today.\"\n\nShort's comments indicate a potential shift in the Republican president's approach, aiming to collaborate with both Democrats and Republicans in enacting his agenda. On Tuesday evening, Trump is scheduled to dine with a bipartisan group of senators, whose support he hopes to secure for tax code overhaul legislation.\n\nDemocrats welcomed Short's DACA comments, stating they remove a significant obstacle to legislation aimed at helping DACA recipients, often referred to as Dreamers. Democrats have consistently stated they will not allow border funding to be part of any legislation and would likely have the Senate votes to block a provision they object to.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin, a senior Democrat who has been advocating for Dreamers for the past 16 years, commented, \"That's an important position because we cannot make a 2,200-mile (3,540 km) wall a condition for passing the Dream Act, and we've been very clear from the start.\"\n\nDemocrats are open to working with the White House and congressional Republicans on other border security measures as part of the legislation, Durbin added. However, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, criticized the potential shift on DACA, stating the White House appears to be seeking an \"escape hatch\" on the controversial DACA program.\n\nTrump announced last week that he was ending an Obama-era program that shields from deportation immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children. The move leaves nearly 800,000 Dreamers facing uncertainty about their status in a country that many consider their only home.",
    " Title: Conservative Candidates Face Increased Criticism from Liberal Media Ahead of Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe liberal media and the Democratic National Committee have been vocal in their criticism of several top Republican candidates, with a recent attack on Kentucky Senator Rand Paul by The Washington Post. The escalation of negative coverage towards conservative figures is a common tactic as the left perceives the threat level to their political ideology.\n\nSenator Paul, a leading libertarian conservative, has been a vocal opponent of interventionist foreign policy, and his stance on Syria may have prevented the U.S. from joining forces with ISIS. In 2013, many prominent political figures, including President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John McCain, advocated for military intervention against the Assad regime, supporting the Free Syrian Army. Some members of the Free Syrian Army later became ISIS fighters.\n\nSenator Paul's caution in Syria was warranted, as he correctly identified the Al Qaeda-affiliated jihadists in Syria as the real threat, and advised against actions that would aid ISIS. In the following years, the foreign policy establishment has shifted its stance, now advocating for the destruction of ISIS.\n\nThe increased criticism of conservative candidates in the mainstream media should be met with caution, as it may stem from fear of losing power. With the upcoming November midterm elections and the 2016 presidential election, the Democrats are at risk of losing their majority in the Senate and important committee chairs. The author expresses support for the return of conservative, libertarian, and free market principles in U.S. politics.",
    " Title: U.S. Foreign Policy Under Obama: A Review of Key Decisions and Their Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's foreign policy has been marked by a series of decisions that have led to a perceived disengagement from global affairs, leaving power vacuums that have been filled by various adversaries. This assessment is based on the administration's approach to several key international issues, including the Iran nuclear deal, the \"reset\" with Russia, and the withdrawal from Iraq.\n\nDuring the first six months of President Obama's tenure, he embarked on an \"apology tour,\" seeking to mend relations with other nations, particularly Russia. This was followed by the dispatch of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Geneva with a \"reset\" button, which was quickly followed by the cancellation of the U.S.'s missile defense system in Eastern Europe. This move was seen as a betrayal of U.S. allies and a sign of the administration's willingness to find common ground with adversaries.\n\nIn late 2011, the U.S. abandoned support for the Iraqi military, weakening its ability to defend the country. This withdrawal created a vacuum that was exploited by the rise of ISIS. The Obama administration's perceived inaction in response to the use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar Assad, which was labeled a \"red line,\" is another example of this disengagement.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal, announced in 2015, has been criticized for lifting sanctions in exchange for a pause in Iran's nuclear weapons development. The deal, which has been described as a windfall for the Iranian regime, is expected to provide Iran with over $100 billion almost immediately, access to conventional arms in five years, ballistic missile technology in eight years, and an unfettered path to nuclear weapons in 10 to 15 years.\n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, has expressed concern over the Iran deal, stating that it only delays the inevitable while pushing the problem's ultimate resolution onto a future administration. He also criticizes the deal for offering only short-term limitations on nuclear enrichment while failing to secure unfettered \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections.\n\nThe Iranian regime, with a history of reckless behavior and support for terrorism, has been accused of having no intention of changing its ways. Critics argue that the deal rewards Iran for its actions, while failing to secure the necessary oversight to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n\nIn conclusion, the Obama administration's foreign policy has been characterized by a perceived disengagement from global affairs, leaving power vacuums that have been filled by various adversaries. The Iran nuclear deal, in particular, has been criticized for its perceived lack of oversight and the potential for rewarding Iran for its actions.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Fail U.S. Citizenship Test, Raising Concerns About Historical and Civic Literacy\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation has revealed that a majority of Americans, excluding those from Vermont, would fail the U.S. citizenship test. The survey, conducted between November 14, 2018, and January 3, 2019, among 41,000 adults, used 20 history-specific questions from the practice tests for people taking the citizenship exam.\n\nThe results are concerning, with only 4 out of 10 Americans passing the test. The age group that performed the worst was those under 45, with just 27% passing. The gender divide showed a higher failure rate for women (68%) compared to men (44%). The oldest age group, however, performed the best, with more earning an A or B than an F (27% A or B, 26% F).\n\nThe survey also revealed that there was virtually no difference in the test scores between self-identified liberals and conservatives. The test results have sparked discussions about the state of historical and civic literacy in the United States, with some suggesting that high school students should be required to pass a standardized civics test to graduate.\n\nIndiana is currently considering such a bill, Senate Bill 132, which calls for all high school students to take and pass a civics test equivalent to the one administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, starting with the 2020-2021 academic year. The bill, authored by Indiana Sens. Dennis Kruse, John Ruckelshaus, and Eric Koch, passed the Indiana Senate on a 31-17 vote and now awaits a House vote.\n\nThe test from the national fellowship named after Woodrow Wilson, a former U.S. president and a controversial figure, is available for those interested in testing their historical and civic knowledge. The test's questions cover various aspects of U.S. history and government.\n\nThe poor performance on the citizenship test has sparked discussions about the need for remedial history and civics courses, as well as remedial math courses, to improve the historical and civic literacy of Americans. The concern is that a lack of understanding of American government and history could lead to uninformed decisions and a lack of engagement in the political process.",
    " Title: Trump and Schiff Face Off Over Ukraine Call Transcript, Whistleblower Complaint\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets and public statements, President Donald Trump and Representative Adam Schiff have engaged in a heated exchange over the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a subsequent whistleblower complaint.\n\nTrump accused Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of fabricating a version of the call's transcript and lying about the contents during a committee meeting last Thursday. Schiff's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Adam Schiff made up what I said. He actually took words and made it up... The reason is, when he saw my call to the president of Ukraine, it was so good that he could not quote from it. Because there was nothing done wrong. It was perfect,\" Trump said during a swearing-in ceremony for his new Labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, on Monday.\n\nSchiff's portrayal of the call, which he offered during a hearing last week, bore no resemblance to the actual transcript, according to Trump. Trump previously demanded that Schiff be \"questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason\" and claimed that his \"lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and Eric Trump, the president's son, also assailed Schiff on Monday, with Giuliani charging that Schiff \"did not embellish but instead lied about\" the White House's summary of the Zelensky call.\n\nIn addition to his criticism of Schiff, Trump sought to cast doubt on the accuracy of the whistleblower complaint that detailed his call with Zelensky and alleged efforts by White House officials to \"lock down\" records of the conversation. The president claimed that the complaint was \"mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President\" and that the whistleblower \"knew almost nothing.\"\n\nThe whistleblower complaint, filed in early August, alleged that the president's actions could be used by foreign powers to interfere in the 2020 election. The complaint's description of the call between Trump and Zelensky is largely similar to the readout the White House produced last Wednesday.\n\nTrump has also criticized the whistleblower, asserting that \"I deserve to meet my accuser\" and that the person who provided the information to the intelligence official may have been spying on the president. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint that he or she was not a direct witness to most of the events described but wrote that the complaint's allegations were informed by the accounts of more than half a dozen U.S. officials provided over the prior four months.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint's description of the call between Trump and Zelensky is largely similar to the readout the White House produced last Wednesday. Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, testified before Schiff's Intelligence committee last Thursday that \"the whistleblower's complaint is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president.\"",
    " Title: Senate News: Sanders Calls for Repeal of GOP Tax Law, McConnell Promotes Tax Cuts, and Judicial Appointments Confirmed\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has called for the repeal of the Republican tax law, citing concerns over the projected increase in the federal budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that the budget deficit will reach $804 billion for 2018 and $1 trillion in 2020, two years earlier than anticipated. The national debt is also expected to hit $33 trillion in ten years, up from the current $21 trillion mark.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the tax law, passed in December, for contributing to the acceleration of the deficit and debt. However, Sen. Sanders' call for repeal comes amidst his own proposed single-payer healthcare scheme, which could inflict tens of trillions in unfunded and debt-bloating federal liabilities upon America's budget.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are running ads online, including on Facebook, highlighting the day-to-day impact of their tax cuts and warning about potential tax increases under a Democratic administration. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is also promoting elements of the law that are helping small businesses across the country.\n\nIn other Senate news, Rick Scott has officially entered the Florida Senate race against Bill Nelson. Scott, whose job approval as governor is strong, will face a tough challenge in a tough election year. The current, razor-thin GOP upper chamber majority continues to confirm President Trump's judicial appointments at an aggressive pace.\n\nThis week, the Senate is expected to confirm Claria Horn Boom as U.S. District Judge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky, and Rebecca Jennings as W. District Judge for Kentucky. This confirmation of judicial appointments is considered crucial by many conservatives for retaining a tight Republican majority in the Senate.",
    " Title: Call for Elimination of Midterm Elections in U.S. Due to Perceived Harmful Effects on American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2022 midterm elections, approximately 90 million Americans are expected to cast their votes, with less than 40% of the electorate participating. Despite the significant spending on campaigns, amounting to over $1 billion and more than two million ads, the midterm elections are likely to exacerbate partisan divisions and increase gridlock in governance.\n\nThe author argues that the two-year term for federal midterm elections no longer serves a purpose, especially given the low confidence in the government's ability to address pressing concerns. They suggest that the elimination of federal midterm elections could be beneficial, as there are few offices with two-year terms at any level of government.\n\nIn Durham, for example, school board members and county sheriffs are elected to terms that are twice as long as federal midterm terms. The author also points out that modern technologies, such as Twitter, video cameras, and 24-hour cable news, provide a level of hyper-accountability that the framers could not have imagined, making frequent elections unnecessary for communicating voters' desires to their elected officials.\n\nHowever, the author contends that the two-year cycle is not only unnecessary but also harmful to American politics. The main impact of the midterm election in the modern era has been to weaken the president, the only government official (other than the vice president) elected by the entire nation. Since the end of World War II, the president's party has on average lost 25 seats in the House and about 4 in the Senate as a result of the midterms. This trend is consistent across Democratic and Republican presidencies.",
    " Title: Romney's Debate Performance and Its Potential Impact on the Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming presidential debate between Mitt Romney and incumbent President Barack Obama is generating significant anticipation, with both campaigns downplaying expectations ahead of Wednesday's event. The debate is expected to be a crucial moment for Romney, who is aiming to deliver a standout performance that could potentially shift the polls in his favor.\n\nAccording to The Week magazine, Romney has a 60% chance of delivering a game-changing performance. Some Republicans suggest that Romney plans to \"fact-check\" the president, indicating an aggressive strategy of highlighting damning statistics, such as the unemployment rate above 8% or the national debt of $16 trillion.\n\nHowever, even a stellar performance by Romney does not guarantee a shift in the polls. Undecided voters would need to tune in, the media would need to share a positive opinion of Romney's performance, the campaign would need to effectively communicate his victory to the public, and voters would need to be convinced to care.\n\nThe debate's significance is noteworthy in this election cycle, as the focus has been on culture, morals, personality, and trust rather than the economy. Romney aims to use the debate to showcase himself as a compelling politician and a relatable human being, discussing his family and father, subjects close to his heart, in an effort to redefine his national image.\n\nIf Romney manages to make an impact, it could significantly alter public perception of both candidates. In 1980, Ronald Reagan's debate performance helped shift public sentiment, convincing a broadly hostile audience that he was not a raging, radical conservative but actually a placid, funny guy. While the debate was not the sole factor in the election's outcome, it did contribute to a shift in public sentiment.\n\nAdvice on how Romney should approach the debate is coming from various sources, ranging from going on the attack to articulating a positive vision. One piece of advice Romney should disregard is from Newt Gingrich, who suggests the nominee should use humor. Given Romney's history of turning a joke into a global laughingstock, it would be wiser for him to stick to the facts.",
    " Title: US Congresswomen Protest Dress Code, Advocate for Relaxation of Sleeves Rule in Capitol Building\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of US Congresswomen staged a protest in the Capitol building on Friday, advocating for a relaxation of the long-standing dress code that has been enforced in parts of the building. The protest, dubbed \"Sleeveless Friday,\" was initiated by Representative Jackie Speier who encouraged colleagues to wear sleeveless clothing to highlight the issue.\n\nApproximately 25 women gathered on the steps of Congress, wearing sleeveless shirts and dresses, to protest the rule that prohibits bare arms in the lobby area where press meets US politicians. The rule, which also applies to men who are required to wear suit jackets and ties, has been a point of contention for some, particularly female reporters who have been prevented from entering the lobby area due to their outfits.\n\nRepresentative Chellie Pingree tweeted, \"It's 2017 and women vote, hold office, and choose their own style. Time to update House Rules to reflect the times!\" The rules, which are rarely enforced, have recently come under scrutiny as those affected have expressed surprise at their application.\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged the issue, stating, \"It came to my attention that there was an issue about dress code.\" He emphasized that the code had not been devised under his term and agreed that it needs to be modernized.\n\nIn the UK, a similar debate erupted recently when House of Commons Speaker John Bercow expressed a willingness to relax the rules. In June, he accepted a question from a member of parliament who was not wearing a tie. However, what constitutes appropriate attire in 2017, especially with the rise of more casual media and tech companies, is not always clear.",
    " Title: Senate Impeachment Trial: Enforcing Subpoenas and the Potential Legal Battle Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic leadership's decision to send articles of impeachment to the Senate without countering President Trump's alleged interference with House proceedings is seen as a missed opportunity. However, the Senate impeachment trial provides a second chance for confrontation, with the added benefit of bipartisan support for any subpoenas issued.\n\nThe enforcement of subpoenas is crucial to maintain the impartiality, independence, and integrity of the impeachment process. The President's assertion of executive privilege, allowing him to prevent witnesses from testifying or withholding incriminating documents, is a concern. This expansion of executive privilege, as demonstrated by the President's encouragement for witnesses to defy subpoenas and his proposed use of executive privilege to block current and former administration officials from testifying, challenges the constitutional balance of power.\n\nIf the Senate subpoenas witnesses, the Trump legal team may assert executive privilege or testimonial immunity to block their enforcement. This would be a misuse of these concepts, as it could weaken congressional authority and establish the President's entitlement to use his office to evade scrutiny.\n\nEnforcing subpoenas during an impeachment trial could be complex. The Senate Impeachment Rules grant the Senate the power to compel witness attendance and enforce obedience to its orders. However, the sergeant-at-arms, who enforces Congress' orders, lacks a jail or a full police force. Congress has not used its enforcement powers since 1934, which could lead to the Senate turning to the courts for assistance in enforcing subpoenas. Alternatively, witnesses could defend against a Senate order to testify in a federal court.\n\nThis could result in a legal battle between Congress' power and the executive branch's claims of executive authority, potentially reaching the Supreme Court during Chief Justice John Roberts' presiding over the trial. If Justice Roberts were to recuse himself, the country might face the specter of a Supreme Court deadlocked on the critical question of whether a sitting President undergoing an impeachment trial has the right to assert executive privilege to block witnesses at his own trial.",
    " Title: New York Representative Recognizes Concerns Over 9/11 Responder Cancer Compensation, but Approves Link to Toxic Substances\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York and a primary sponsor of the 2010 law establishing the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, acknowledged concerns about the decision to link certain cancers to the toxic substances found at Ground Zero but stated that the decision was the correct one.\n\nOne cancer patient, Ernest K. Matthews, 62, who typifies the complex nature of the decision, developed lung cancer in 2008 and had part of his right lung removed. He was part of a crew that cleaned elevators for the Merrill Lynch building near Ground Zero after the terrorist attack. He was also a smoker.\n\nHowever, Mr. Matthews stated that he was able to walk up six flights of stairs carrying a heavy tool bag without difficulty before September 11. He developed breathing problems soon after, he said.\n\n\"It's a good day,\" Mr. Matthews said on Friday. \"Look at all the people that suffered and lost their lives, sacrificing for the cleanup. It took so long for them to decide to help the people that were suffering.\"\n\nDr. Howard's decision represents a shift from immediate assurances by the federal government after the terrorist attacks that there was no cause for concern regarding the air quality. In July 2011, Dr. Howard himself stated that there was not enough scientific or medical evidence to link cancer to September 11.\n\nHowever, in a lengthy report explaining his decision, Dr. Howard cited a New York Fire Department study published last fall in the British medical journal The Lancet, which showed that firefighters exposed to Ground Zero toxic substances had about a 20 percent higher rate of cancer than firefighters who were not exposed.\n\nBeyond the Lancet study, Dr. Howard relied on recommendations made by a scientific and technical advisory committee consisting of experts from the fields of cancer, environmental medicine, toxicology, and epidemiology, as well as neighborhood activists and union officials. He fully adopted the committee's recommendation that 14 broad categories of cancer, encompassing 50 specific types, should be deemed as related to the attacks.\n\nAmong the cancers Dr. Howard approved are some of the most common, including lung, breast, colon, trachea, esophageal, kidney, bladder, skin, thyroid, blood, and ovarian cancers. Dr. Howard also approved childhood cancers, which are relatively rare, because children are more susceptible to toxic substances.\n\nPeople with covered cancers who lived, worked, or attended school in Lower Manhattan\u2014generally the area below Canal Street\u2014between September 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002, would be able to apply for compensation for their economic losses, pain, and suffering. Until the decision on Friday, the only ailments approved for compensation were mainly respiratory and digestive ones. Survivors of patients who have died, as well as people caught in the dust cloud downtown on the day of the attack, may also apply.\n\nThe amount of compensation will depend on the severity of the illness and duration of exposure, as proven by records like employment or housing documents, or city personnel records for fire, police, and other public workers.\n\nThe new rules would apply to Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa., responders as well, and it allows those cancer patients to tap into a treatment fund to pay for medical costs not covered by insurance.\n\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has consistently deferred to scientific rulings on health hazards at Ground Zero, said that his administration had called for periodic reviews of the medical evidence on cancer, and that the decision was \"an important step.\"\n\nThe advisory committee had stated that 70 known or potential carcinogens, including asbestos, arsenic, and formaldehyde, had been found in the smoke, dust, and fumes from the disaster, that 15 of those were known to cause cancer in humans, and that 37 were \"reasonably anticipated\" to cause cancer.\n\nThe advisory committee considered but rejected, by a 14-to-3 vote, the notion of adding all cancers to the list. It explicitly rejected pancreas, brain, and prostate cancers, for various reasons. The committee could meet again to discuss other potential additions to the list.\n\nThe broad sweep of the committee's recommendation raised some eyebrows among epidemiologists, several of whom have said that it appeared the committee was appealing to societal concerns that the cancer patients not be left out of the fund.\n\n\"Clearly this was a difficult decision, and primarily motivated by concern for a sympathetic population,\" said Dr. Alfred I. Neugut, an oncologist and professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia. \"The scientific evidence currently is certainly weak; whether future evidence bears out the wisdom of this decision will have to be seen.\"\n\nDr. Howard made a nod toward a concern of some epidemiologists that because cancer was a common disease, it would be hard to distinguish who got cancer because of September 11 from those who did not. He also said that hard scientific data conclusively linking September 11 to cancer might take years to obtain.\n\n\"Requiring evidence of positive associations from studies of 9/11-exposed populations exclusively does not serve the best interests\" of the patients, he wrote.",
    " Title: Michigan Primary: Cruz and Kasich Compete for Second Place as Sanders Aims for Surprise Win\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Michigan primary on Tuesday, March 8, is set to be a significant event in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. The state, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, is expected to provide insights into the strategies of the Republican candidates, particularly Ted Cruz and John Kasich, as they vie for second place behind front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nTed Cruz's performance in Michigan is uncertain, as the state is a blue state with fewer evangelical voters, a demographic that Cruz has relied on in previous contests. Cruz has faced challenges in states with a more liberal lean, and his performance in Michigan could indicate his ability to compete in upcoming Democratic-leaning states such as California, New Jersey, and New York.\n\nJohn Kasich, on the other hand, could potentially benefit from the struggles of Marco Rubio, who has performed poorly in recent primaries. Kasich, a relatively moderate governor from a neighboring state, is polling closely with Cruz for second place in Michigan. The race for second place serves as a test for both Cruz and Kasich, each aiming to present themselves as the strongest alternative to Trump.\n\nIn the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders faces a challenging situation in Michigan. The state, with its high percentage of white, working-class voters and history of outsourcing, seems to align with Sanders' economic message. Michigan also has significant college towns like Ann Arbor and East Lansing, which tend to lean liberal. However, the state is whiter than the nation as a whole, and black voters, who have been a significant factor in Hillary Clinton's Southern victories, make up roughly the same share of the electorate in Michigan as they do nationally.\n\nGiven Sanders' performance in the early primaries, his need for a strong showing in Michigan is particularly high. Polls suggest that Clinton is on track for a decisive victory, and a surprise win for Sanders in Michigan would demonstrate his continued viability in the race.\n\nThe Michigan primary on Tuesday will provide valuable insights into the strategies and momentum of the candidates as the primary season moves forward.",
    " Title: President Trump's Campaign Commits $10 Million for Midterm Advertising Blitz\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's campaign operation is planning an advertising blitz for the final two weeks before the midterms, as part of a multimillion-dollar bid to help Republicans maintain control of Congress. According to the campaign, this commitment includes a $6 million TV and digital ad buy set to launch on October 29 and last through Election Day. The campaign is also sending $3 million to the Republican National Committee (RNC) to boost GOP campaigns, while Trump plans to host at least 10 more \"Make America Great Again\" rallies in support of Republicans before the election.\n\nIn total, the president's campaign reports that the nearly $10 million commitment is part of more than $20 million the operation is spending on the midterm elections, including rally costs.\n\n\"President Trump is all-in for the midterms to lead the GOP to victory on Election Day,\" Trump Campaign Manager Brad Parscale said in a statement Tuesday. \"His winning spirit is energizing Americans across the country to get out the vote and keep the momentum of our America First agenda going strong.\"\n\nTrump's 2020 campaign has already amassed a massive war chest, raising roughly $100 million to date. He enters his re-election battle with a sizable fundraising advantage against any Democratic candidate, but will draw down some of that this fall in the fight to keep Congress in Republican hands.\n\nThe MAGA rallies being held on a regular basis serve a dual purpose\u2014boosting GOP candidates in the midterms while allowing Trump to connect with his base and keep them energized ahead of the 2020 fight. Since the summer, Trump has held 20 such rallies so far. Over the last several months, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence also have attended dozens of candidate and GOP committee fundraisers, according to the campaign.\n\nAt the two-week mark, Republicans are seen as holding the edge in the race for control of the Senate, while Democrats remain favored in the race for the House\u2014but their advantage is narrowing in recent polling. According to the latest NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll, in competitive districts, Democrats and Republicans are in a dead heat on the question of which party should control Congress. A Washington Post survey out Tuesday reported that Democrats hold a \"statistically insignificant lead\" in battleground districts.\n\nThe ultimate impact of Trump's policies and presence on the campaign trail remains to be seen, but he has shown no hesitation about latching his name and his brand to Republican candidates across the country\u2014most recently, former primary rival Ted Cruz, during a Texas rally Monday night. While many Democrats are trying to damage GOP incumbents by linking them to Trump, some of those same incumbents are openly embracing the Trump agenda and the president's visible campaign role.\n\n\"President Trump energizes our base like no one else. The overwhelming amount of time and money he\u2019s spending is fueling grassroots enthusiasm for all of our candidates,\" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to the news source. \"That support has enabled the RNC to build our largest field program ever to get out the vote and defy history on Election Day.\"\n\nAside from rallies, the next big commitment will come in the form of the ad buy set to launch on October 29.\n\n\"With so much at stake in the midterms, we\u2019re leaving everything on the field to build our incredible progress for the American people,\" Lara Trump, a campaign senior adviser and daughter-in-law to the president, said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the RNC last week announced a record $269.9 million raised in a non-presidential election year, with $56.8 million raised in the third quarter. The RNC told the news source that 40 percent of the total were small-dollar donations. The Democratic National Committee has raised $136 million so far this cycle, including $9.6 million in September, compared with the RNC's $26.2 million.\n\nThe RNC piggy bank will grow a bit bigger with the Trump campaign vowing to transfer $3 million. The new transfer is in addition to direct contributions of $214,000 made by the campaign in August to 107 House and Senate campaigns.\n\nDespite the RNC's fundraising edge over its counterpart, Democratic candidates have benefited from a windfall of individual donations, fueled in part by the fundraising tool \"ActBlue,\" which has sent more than $1 billion in donations to Democrats this cycle.\n\nBoth parties are taking an equally urgent tone in appealing to voters not to sit out the election.\n\n\"This is the most important election of our lifetime,\" DNC Chairman Tom Perez tweeted.",
    " Title: Democratic Senators Accuse SBA of Politically-Motivated Action in Planned Parenthood PPP Loan Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and other Democratic lawmakers are accusing the Trump administration of unfairly targeting Planned Parenthood affiliates amid reports that some affiliated health care centers are being pressured by the government to return federally-funded, potentially forgivable small business loans granted through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza, Democrats argue that by seeking to reclaim the PPP funds, the SBA is taking an \"ideologically-driven action\" in order to \"score political points for this administration by attacking nonprofit health care providers.\"\n\nThe lawmakers add that \"the administration's longstanding campaign against reproductive health generally, and Planned Parenthood specifically, strongly suggests that Planned Parenthood is being arbitrarily singled out amongst over 4.3 million loans that have been issued under this program.\" Forty Democratic senators and one independent senator endorsed the letter.\n\nThe SBA has notified at least three Planned Parenthood affiliates that they should return their PPP loans. It's unclear if other clinics have been contacted. SBA officials declined to respond to questions from ABC News, saying that they do not comment on individual borrowers. ABC News reached out to the Treasury Department as well, but received no response.\n\nPlanned Parenthood maintains that their affiliates rightfully qualified for the PPP funding. \"Like many other local nonprofits and health care providers, some independent Planned Parenthood 501 (c) (3) organizations applied for and were awarded loans under the eligibility rules established by the CARES Act and the Small Business Administration (SBA), which they met,\" Jacqueline Ayers, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's vice president of government relations and public policy, said in a statement.\n\nThe eligibility rules, outlined by the SBA, allow for most businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 500 workers to qualify for PPP. However, Republicans have argued that since Planned Parenthood Federation of America has organizational control over its affiliates, and it should be considered as one large enterprise with too many employees to qualify for the lending program.\n\nIn their own letter last week, Senate Republicans urged the Department of Justice to open an investigation into reports that Planned Parenthood affiliates received roughly $80 million from the program. However, Planned Parenthood says that because the individual affiliates that received PPP loans have their own governing boards, they must be considered as smaller, standalone entities that lawfully qualify for the program.\n\nThe SBA's rules for determining eligibility for the PPP have been a source of confusion since their implementation, but in their letter, Democrats claim the intention of the program has always been clear. \"The decision to fund PPP was based on a mutual and bipartisan consensus that it was important for this program to assist the broad universe of nonprofit organizations in this country, many of whom provide food assistance, health care services, child care, charitable services, and other essential functions that constitute a critical component of our social safety net,\" the lawmakers wrote.",

Louie Gohmert Discusses Second Amendment on Fox News Sunday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a discussion on Fox News Sunday, Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) expressed his views on the Second Amendment in light of recent mass shootings, including the Connecticut massacre and the Aurora movie theater shooting.\n\nDuring the segment, Eric Holder, the U.S. Attorney General, expressed a need for a national discussion on the freedom and rights Americans have, and how they can be used responsibly. In response, Rep. Gohmert brought up the Fast and Furious operation, in which the Department of Justice forced the sale of guns that led to the deaths of individuals, including Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.\n\nWhen asked about the Aurora movie theater massacre and his argument for more people to carry weapons to prevent similar incidents, Rep. Gohmert stated that every mass killing of more than three people in recent history has occurred in places where guns were prohibited, except for one. He argued that having armed individuals could have prevented such tragedies, citing the defensive wounds on children and the heroic actions of the principal who tried to protect them.\n\nIn response to the question of why people need semi-automatic weapons, Rep. Gohmert referenced George Washington's statement that a free people should be an armed people, ensuring against the tyranny of the government if the American people are the largest armed force. He also argued that allowing concealed carry has led to a decrease in crime rates.\n\nThe discussion concluded with Rep. Gohmert stating that emotional reactions should not lead to the immediate call for the elimination of all guns, and that a rational, fact-based approach should be taken when considering gun control measures.",
    " Title: Health and Human Services Plan to Share Medical Records with 35 Federal Agencies Sparks Concerns Over Privacy and Security\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department has announced a plan to share individuals' medical records with over 35 federal agencies, sparking concerns over privacy and security. The plan, detailed in the Federal Health IT Strategic Plan 2015-2020, aims to improve healthcare, individual and community health, and research by collecting, sharing, and using electronic health information.\n\nThe plan, according to The Weekly Standard, outlines the roles of these 35 departments and agencies in the collection, sharing, and use of electronic health information. The plan includes the Department of Defense, NASA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Federal Communications Commission, and several other federal agencies.\n\nCritics argue that this plan is the start of a single-payer health care infrastructure, a concern due to the potential for government control over health care delivery. The concern is that the sharing of personal health care information with multiple federal agencies poses a threat to privacy and personal security.\n\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act requires physicians and hospitals to transfer secure paper-based medical records to an \"electronic\" system, i.e., the Internet. This transfer of records removes privacy and control in the relationship between patients and their doctors, as records are moved from office file cabinets to the Internet \"cloud.\"\n\nThe plan has been met with criticism, with some arguing that it has nothing to do with delivering health care and instead serves to establish a single-payer health care infrastructure. The plan's proponents argue that it will make the health care system more efficient.\n\nThe plan has been met with opposition, with some calling for the public to voice their concerns during the two-month public comment period ending on Feb. 6. Critics argue that the plan represents everything dangerous about an expanding federal government and is an unacceptable violation of privacy and expansion of the federal government's control of our lives.",

In an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie that aired Thursday on \"Today,\" Pelosi seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice guidelines suggesting a sitting president cannot be indicted might not be absolute.\n\nWhen asked about the special counsel Robert Mueller respecting the Department of Justice guidelines that suggest a sitting president cannot be indicted, Pelosi responded, \"I do not think that that is conclusive. No, I do not.\"\n\nMueller's team is currently investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign. Mueller has indicted multiple high-ranking Trump campaign officials on crimes seemingly unrelated to Russian interference, and he is expected to release a report to Congress detailing his findings as soon as mid-February.\n\nThe relevant Justice Department guidance, drafted in 2000 by the office of legal counsel, states, \"The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\"\n\nIn making the case that the guidance in question might be ignored, Pelosi pointed out that there is no existing legislation prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president.\n\n\"It's not the law,\" Pelosi told Guthrie. \"Everything indicates that a president can be indicted after he is no longer president of the United States.\"\n\nWhen asked directly if Mueller can indict a sitting president, Pelosi responded, \"Let's just see what Mueller does. Let's spend our time on getting results for the American people.\"\n\nWhen asked if Mueller could indict a sitting president, Pelosi said, \"I think that is an open discussion. I think that's an open discussion in terms of the law.\"\n\nPelosi, who served as the first female Speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011, is expected to reclaim the gavel in a Thursday afternoon leadership vote. The veteran California lawmaker has attempted to avoid the question of Trump's impeachment in the weeks leading up to the leadership vote but has pledged to thoroughly investigate the president using Congressional subpoena power.",
    " Title: House GOP to Address Immigration Reform in Upcoming Conference Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Republican Conference is set to convene on July 10 to discuss the approach to address the Senate-passed immigration reform bill. The meeting, which will take place in the Capitol basement, follows a week-long recess during which lawmakers returned to their districts to gather constituent feedback on the Senate plan.\n\nLeadership anticipates differing opinions within the party, with some members feeling compelled to act swiftly, while others may advocate for a more cautious approach. However, top GOP aides and lawmakers are privately skeptical that any immigration bill, even with enhanced border security measures, can secure the support of 218 Republicans, the number required for passage.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner and his leadership team are aware of the political pressure that will mount but do not view immigration as a time-sensitive issue. They are comfortable allowing the process to extend until the end of the year.\n\nKey lawmakers have been meeting with groups of rank-and-file Republicans, but have found it challenging to discern the \"coalitions\" - the pockets of opposition and support for various proposals. Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a member of leadership, expressed uncertainty when asked about potential measures that could garner enough Republican support for a floor vote.\n\nThe leadership's strategy is taking shape, with the July 10 meeting expected to chart a course forward on immigration reform. The meeting, dubbed the \"Special GOP conference meeting,\" will be structured into a three-step process.\n\nGOP leadership, likely including Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), will deliver a brief presentation, urging lawmakers to express their views to help the party develop a policy.\n\nJudiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas) will explain what House committees have already passed and the options moving forward. The leadership aims to determine where members stand on four main areas: the future flow of immigrants into the U.S., a possible pathway to citizenship, government benefits, and border security.\n\nThe House may choose to address these items separately or combine them in a single bill. Putting the bills together could allow members to claim support for a package containing items they both favor and oppose. Alternatively, the House could take up the Senate bill in committee, strip it down, and rewrite it.\n\nMuch of the decision-making process will occur in a more discreet manner.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Meets with President Obama and Vice President Biden at the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton returned to the White House on Monday for a lunch with President Barack Obama, marking her first visit to the building since leaving her post earlier this year. The meeting, which was largely a social gathering, took place in the midst of preparations for Middle East peace negotiations in Washington.\n\nDeputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that the lunch was an opportunity for Clinton and Obama, who had a strong working relationship and genuine friendship during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, to catch up. Clinton also met with Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday at the Naval Observatory.\n\nThe lunch menu consisted of grilled chicken, pasta jambalaya, and salad. Current Secretary of State John Kerry was also present at the White House, but it appears he did not join the lunchtime meeting. Clinton did, however, stop by to say hello while Kerry met with National Security Adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThe meeting between Clinton and Obama was arranged after the pair saw each other at the George W. Bush Presidential Center dedication ceremony in April. With both individuals having busy schedules this summer, July 28th was the agreed-upon date for the get-together.\n\nClinton, a potential candidate for the 2016 White House race, has been active post-State, appearing at events focused on women's empowerment and maintaining a busy speaking engagement schedule. She has also launched an initiative through the Clinton Foundation dedicated to early childhood development and signed a book deal in April for a diplomacy-centered memoir to be released in 2014.",
    " Title: Biden's Unconventional Approach at Democratic Presidential Town Hall on LGBTQ Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the Democratic presidential town hall on LGBTQ issues on Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden took an unconventional approach to demonstrate his emotional concern for the queer community. In a series of unexpected and somewhat uncomfortable moments, Biden flirted with multiple men, joked about coming out as gay, and mimed kissing Anderson Cooper, the gay CNN anchor moderating his portion of the town hall.\n\nBiden's actions, which included telling a well-dressed audience member he looked like he \"just stepped out of Gentlemen's Quarterly\" and reenacting a kiss with President Barack Obama, were met with a mix of laughter and discomfort from the audience. The former vice president's actions were described as \"hilariously off-tone, uncomfortable, and strained\" in a report by The Cut.\n\nBiden's actions were not the only awkward moments of the night. Senator Kamala Harris stated her pronouns as she/her/hers, to which CNN's Chris Cuomo replied, \"Mine, too.\" However, Biden's actions were the most persistent and bizarre of the night.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his actions, Biden ended his time with Cooper on a note of acceptance, affirming that being queer in 2019 is \"normal\" and \"normalized.\" He also noted the progress made in public discourse around LGBTQ issues in recent decades, stating that discussions about LGBTQ issues in the past were often focused on \"gay bathhouses\" and \"round-the-clock sex.\"\n\nThe town hall was intended to discuss the future of LGBTQ lives in America, but Biden's actions overshadowed much of the intended discussion. The former vice president's approach to demonstrating his support for the LGBTQ community was met with a mix of amusement and discomfort by many observers.",
    " Title: Mortgage Industry Faces Potential Crisis Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to industry estimates suggesting that between 25 and 50 percent of mortgage borrowers may be unable to make their payments. This could potentially threaten the viability of mortgage servicers, particularly nonbank servicers, according to a letter from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on March 25.\n\nIf 25 percent of borrowers fail to make their mortgage payments, the industry would require approximately $40 billion to cover three months of payments, according to Jay Bray, CEO of the servicing company Mr. Cooper. Depending on the duration of the situation, demands on servicers could exceed $75 billion and potentially climb above $100 billion, according to industry expert Michael Broeksmit.\n\nAndrew Jakabovics, vice president for policy development at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable housing nonprofit, stated that if mortgage companies fail en masse, \"the system breaks down.\" He explained that the relief measures implemented during the foreclosure crisis were crucial to maintain U.S. mortgage-backed securities as a safe investment, and any disruption could have serious implications for the availability and price of mortgage credit.\n\nIndustry experts believe that the Federal Reserve will implement an emergency lending program to support the industry. Mark Toomey, who previously managed the $2 trillion portfolio of government-run mortgage financier Ginnie Mae, expressed confidence that the Fed would provide such a program.\n\nMark Calabria, Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage giants that support about half of the nation's $11 trillion market, stated that large banks would continue to extend credit to mortgage servicers for the time being. However, he noted that if the situation persists beyond two months, a more substantial solution would be necessary.\n\nBroeksmit suggested that some mortgage companies may not survive if their loan portfolios are heavily concentrated in areas of the country where the virus has had a significant impact. He also emphasized the need for the emergency lending facility to be established promptly, as some servicers may require liquidity sooner than others.\n\nMargaret Liu, CSBS senior vice president and deputy general counsel, stated that the credit lines from banks would not be sufficient to keep the system afloat. She highlighted the interconnected nature of the mortgage market and the crucial role of the government as a reliable source of credit during a crisis.\n\nIn the interim, the industry is hopeful that individual cash relief in the Senate bill will result in fewer people needing to request forbearance on their payments. Broeksmit expressed hope that the take-up rate won't be high and that the duration won't be extended, but they are preparing for both scenarios.",
    " Title: House Democrats Advance Legal Action for Unredacted Mueller Report, Court Enforcement of Subpoenas\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. congressional Democrats have moved closer to suing in federal court for access to the unredacted Mueller report on Russian election meddling and its underlying evidence, taking a step that is bound to intensify their clash with President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a resolution unveiled on Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee authorized the enforcement of subpoenas against U.S. Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who have refused to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee's requests for the unredacted report, related documents, and testimony from McGahn.\n\nThe resolution, which the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is expected to consider on Tuesday, replaces an earlier plan to vote formally on whether to hold Barr and McGahn in contempt of Congress.\n\nThe measure, introduced by the House Rules Committee, also outlines terms for possible court action by other House committees that are investigating the president and authorizes the Judiciary Committee to petition a federal judge for access to Mueller's grand jury evidence.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is similarly poised to file a federal lawsuit to enforce subpoenas of Trump's individual and business tax returns.\n\nCongressional committees already have the authority to seek court remedies. However, Tuesday's vote is intended to reaffirm congressional authority to enforce subpoenas against White House efforts to stymie investigations by six separate House committees, according to Democratic aides.\n\n\"We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,\" said Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, who will take up the measure on Monday. \"The Trump administration is waging an unprecedented campaign of stonewalling and obstruction... This resolution will allow Congress to hold the president accountable.\"\n\nJustice Department officials were not immediately available to comment on the resolution.\n\nThe measure follows through on House Democrats' plans to go to court in their quest for an unredacted copy of Mueller's report. Democrats say they are confident of swift court victories after decisive court rulings against Trump's efforts to block subpoenas of his financial records issued by three other House panels.\n\nBarr released a redacted version of the 448-page report on April 18. He later disregarded a House Judiciary Committee subpoena demanding the full report, along with the underlying evidence that Mueller relied on. The House Judiciary panel voted on May 8 to cite Barr for contempt of Congress.\n\nIn a letter to Cummings on Thursday, the Justice Department called a contempt vote \"entirely premature\" and declined to hand over the specific documents demanded, saying they were protected by attorney-client privilege and other doctrines. It said it was still working to produce other papers the committee requested.\n\nThe White House has asserted the seldom-used principle of executive privilege to try to keep the full Mueller report under wraps, even though Trump allowed aides to speak with Mueller during his investigation.\n\nHouse Judiciary also subpoenaed McGahn, seeking his testimony, which he refused to provide in line with a pattern of stonewalling by Trump of Democrats' inquiries. Lawmakers have said they would vote to hold Barr and McGahn in contempt. However, on Thursday, aides said a formal contempt vote would have referred the case for criminal prosecution, a move unlikely to succeed with Barr at the helm of the Justice Department. Lawmakers instead opted for the new resolution.",
    " Title: White House Launches Three-Week \"Made in America\" Campaign to Emphasize President Trump's Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is initiating a three-week \"Made in America\" messaging campaign starting on Monday, with the aim of refocusing President Donald Trump's public agenda. The three-week emphasis will highlight key tenets of Trump's agenda, potentially serving as preparation for the Senate's push to rewrite the U.S. tax code.\n\nThe first week will feature American-made products, followed by \"American Heroes week,\" which is expected to focus on American jobs. The final week will be dedicated to the \"American Dream.\" According to a White House official, healthcare will not be the focus of a separate week, with the official stating, \"Every day and every week, in a sense, is a healthcare week. It\u2019s something that enormous White House and administration resources have been devoted to since day one.\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump will showcase a variety of locally made products from all 50 states. He will tour products displayed at the White House and on the South Lawn, and then address the media on his administration's support of manufacturing companies in America. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Wall Street Journal that the campaign will underscore the president's emphasis on reforming the tax code.\n\nThe campaign follows the White House initiative to promote \"theme weeks\" on policy areas, such as \"infrastructure week\" in early June, during which the president tweeted about infrastructure issues daily. Subsequent theme weeks focused on energy and technology. The campaign's launch comes as White House aides are reportedly grappling with determining which of the president's policy priorities to focus on. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a political adviser to Trump, told the Journal that the White House communications team is \"still learning\" how to wield its political influence, and that the team was unclear in stating its goals for the healthcare debate.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 80,000 Jobs in June, Unemployment Rate at 8.2%\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy added 80,000 jobs in June, according to a report by the Labor Department on Friday. This figure represents a slight increase of 3,000 jobs compared to May. The 8.2% unemployment rate is lower than it has been in the last three Junes, but the slow job growth has raised concerns for the current administration.\n\nDeanna Hubbard, who serves customers at Ann's Place in Akron, Ohio, expressed her concerns about the economy's impact on her business and personal life. \"The economy is doing bad. Right now, we've been blessed, but the economy has taken a toll on us with the food prices and delivery prices and people losing their homes,\" she said.\n\nThe slow job growth in June does not bode well for President Barack Obama, but political experts argue that what matters more is a candidate who offers a better long-term plan for economic recovery. Frankly, I think no matter who had been president, the last four years we would have seen very sluggish recovery. It's normal after a financial crisis, but there is a question of where things are going from here,\" said Ken Rogoff, an economics and public policy professor at Harvard University and former International Monetary Fund chief economist.\n\nOhio, a swing state with an unemployment rate of 7.3% in May, is particularly concerned about the economy's future. Before the release of the flat job-growth numbers, President Obama spoke with diners who worked at Goodyear Tire & Rubber and toured the Summer Garden Food Manufacturing plant, which makes pasta sauce, in Boardman, Ohio.\n\nIn a speech to a gathering of a few hundred at an elementary school gym in Poland, Ohio, the president highlighted the economy's slow but steady recovery under his watch, such as businesses creating \"4.4 million new jobs over the past 28 months, including 500,000 new manufacturing jobs,\" and a government program to shore up the ailing U.S. auto industry.\n\nRepublican challenger Mitt Romney called the jobs figures \"another kick in the gut to middle-class families.\" Romney's economic recovery plan includes reducing the corporate income tax rate and curbing some of the regulatory policies he says have driven up energy costs, among other measures to help whittle down the unemployment rate.\n\nThe June jobs figures may make news now, but presidential candidates and voters will be more closely watching a critical jobs report due just days before the November 6 general election, said Tom Smith, an assistant professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. If there's an uptick in jobs creation just before the election, Obama is in good stead. But a downtick could bode well for Romney, Smith said.\n\n\"There are two things that are going to impact this election: the unemployment rate and jobs creation... People are looking for things to get better,\" said Smith. \"People don't have the money to eat.\"",
    " Title: Social Media Reactions Highlight Light-Hearted Moments During State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the State of the Union address delivered by President Donald Trump, social media platforms were abuzz with political analysis, partisan debate, and a series of light-hearted talking points. One of the most popular memes of the night revolved around House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile opponent of the president.\n\nA photo of Pelosi applauding after Trump called for compromise in politics became a subject of discussion, as many on social media perceived this as a symbol of the political rivalry between the two. The incident came after Trump broke traditional protocol by not waiting for the customary introduction from the House speaker before beginning his speech.\n\nAnother notable event was the powerful political statement made by women in Congress, who wore white to celebrate the centenary of women's right to vote in the US. The move highlighted the higher number of female Democrats compared to Republicans in the House.\n\nWhen President Trump stated, \"no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women,\" the female representatives remained stony-faced. However, after Trump mentioned that women \"filled 58% of the newly created jobs last year,\" they started enthusiastically cheering and clapping each other.\n\nMany of the Democratic lawmakers cheering took office after the recent mid-term elections, which saw a record number of women elected, and the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives. The irony of this was not lost on many Twitter users.\n\nPresident Trump and First Lady Melania Trump invited 11-year-old Joshua Trump from Wilmington, Delaware, who has been bullied at school because of his surname. Photos of the boy, who is not related to President Trump, dozing off during the speech earned him some fans on Twitter. His parents pulled him out of school as they said his classmates had called him an \"idiot\" and \"stupid\" for sharing the same name as the president.\n\nEline, the girl sitting next to him, has been treated for brain cancer. She seemed to enjoy the evening a lot more.\n\nSome Twitter users were also distracted by less weighty issues, such as the position of the president's tie. Many took to social media to point out that the president's trademark red tie was off-centre.\n\nDuring the almost 90-minute address, many social media users seemed preoccupied by trying to guess what Nancy Pelosi was reading. Some took to Twitter to suggest that Ms. Pelosi was being \"disrespectful\" by reading while the president spoke.\n\nAfter President Trump finished his address, Stacey Abrams delivered the Democratic response. While Abrams spoke about immigration, voting rights, healthcare, and the economy, Twitter-users homed in on the way the address looked.\n\nMs. Abrams could be seen standing at a lectern in front of a group of people blurred out behind her. Many wondered if she was appearing in front of a green screen. However, as can be seen below, after Ms. Abrams finished speaking and the camera zoomed out, it is clear that a green screen was not used.",
    " Title: Democrats Face Challenges in Seven Key Senate Races Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats are bracing for potential losses in seven key Senate races, with three seats vacated by retiring Democrats and the party struggling to maintain control of the Senate. Four weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, some Democratic operatives find it difficult to envision a scenario where they retain control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday suggests a Republican lead over a Democratic incumbent in Alaska, adding to Democrats' concerns. A Democratic consultant, speaking anonymously, expressed pessimism, stating, \"If you put a gun to my head, I guess I'd say that we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nThe challenges for Democrats are not solely attributed to President Obama, who is often seen as a drag on their candidates. A Democratic operative acknowledged, \"I love the guy and I don't think there's anything he could do to fix it, but he's a real drag.\" However, the bigger issue is the economy, with the economy improving but wages remaining stagnant.\n\nMany of the Democrats defending their seats in GOP-leaning states were swept into office by then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008. In Alaska, for example, Senator Mark Begich won by a narrow margin against Senator Ted Stevens in 2008. However, recent polling shows Begich trailing his GOP opponent, Dan Sullivan, by six percentage points among likely voters.\n\nThe Democrats are defending seven competitive Senate races, including Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. They are feeling cautiously optimistic about only two of these races, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire and Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina.\n\nSen. Hagan currently polls at 44% against her GOP opponent Thom Tillis, with 40%. In 2008, Obama narrowly won North Carolina, and Hagan defeated then-Sen. Elizabeth Dole with 52.7% to 44.2%. However, four years later, North Carolinians opted for Mitt Romney, a GOP governor, and Democrats were down to four out of 13 U.S. House seats. Hagan could still win this November, but it will not be due to a wave; instead, she will have successfully fought against it.\n\nEach race is its own individual microcosm, and the Senate GOP Leader, Mitch McConnell, has a competitive race in Kentucky. Kansas is a unique case, with the Democratic candidate having withdrawn, and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts facing an independent challenger who has not stated which party he will caucus with. Democrats are hoping that if the final vote comes down to Independent Greg Orman, he will remember that Democrats cleared the field for him. A CNN/ORC poll out Wednesday showed the race in a virtual tie with Roberts just one percentage point ahead.\n\nThe Democratic operative noted that his party was benefiting from some GOP struggles, such as the Republican party's inability to raise as much money as intended, infighting among GOP Super-PACs, and general infighting among conservatives. However, midterm elections are generally more difficult for the party that holds the White House, and opposition to Washington appears to be a motivating factor for many voters.\n\n\"A lot of these races are tight right now, but this is not the sort of environment where late-deciding voters are going to break for Democrats,\" the Democratic consultant said, adding that with Democrats in tight races but under 50%, it's tough to imagine all of them breaking in favor of the party that holds the White House. Those Democrats include the ones fighting for their jobs in all seven of these toss-ups. The most recent polling, which could change between now and election day, suggests extremely close margins or a Republican advantage in all of them.",
    " Title: Massachusetts Legislature Recalls Mitt Romney's Tenure as Governor\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts, Democrats held a majority in the state legislature. Romney, who is currently a senator representing Utah, is often praised by Democrats for his work in passing health care reform.\n\nHowever, Romney's leadership style sometimes alienated Democrats, who were accustomed to a different approach. Robert Hedlund, the second-ranking Republican in the state Senate, described Romney as a CEO-style leader who brought over the corporate culture from his former private investment firm, Bain Capital.\n\nRomney replaced many career bureaucrats in the executive staff with private sector outsiders. This management structure, according to Hedlund, produced results in balancing the state's budget.\n\nAcross the aisle, Romney still gets positive reviews for his willingness to work with Democrats to pass health care reform. However, many rank-and-file Democrats are still bothered by what they describe as a distant and guarded leader.\n\nState Rep. Frank Smizik, chairman of the House Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change, recalled Romney's unprecedented move to block off one State House elevator specifically for the governor's office. Romney's security measures and the installation of ropes outside his office turned off some lawmakers, according to Smizik and other Democratic lawmakers.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Ellen Story described Romney as treating government like a big business, while Democratic state Rep. John Scibak was more blunt in his feelings about Romney. Scibak quipped about Romney's decision to forgo a second term to run for the presidency in 2008, saying, \"Many people said, 'Good riddance. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.'\"\n\nAides to the Romney campaign chalked up some of the hard feelings among State House Democrats to election-time loyalties to President Barack Obama. However, the campaign called on Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Jim Vallee, to offer some positive comments on Romney's time as governor.\n\nVallee noted that Romney had an ego but described him as \"high-caliber.\" He also acknowledged that some people did not have a positive relationship with Romney.\n\nMike Widmer, a government watchdog with the nonpartisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, noted that Romney set aside his CEO approach to woo Democratic leaders to pass health care reform. The law, widely considered Romney's signature achievement, is memorialized in his official State House portrait, sitting on a small table along with a framed picture of the former governor's wife, Ann.\n\nRomney struggled in other areas such as job creation, Widmer said, in part because of the governor's CEO style. However, Romney was beginning to divert his attention to pursuing the White House, Widmer and other state lawmakers recalled.\n\nState House insiders often contrast Romney's style with another recent Republican governor, William Weld, who seemed to revel in the kind of behind-closed-doors backslapping that Democrats had come to expect over the years.\n\nDemocratic leaders, who now dominate the Massachusetts State House and control the governor's office, gleefully note the rope lines are gone, and the Romney executive elevator has since been reopened to the general public. Romney's Democratic successor, Gov. Deval Patrick, conceded he made those changes after taking office.\n\nVallee noted Patrick has also upset Democratic lawmakers with his reform efforts. \"You can pick apart any of these guys,\" Vallee said.",

The vigil, organized by the Newtown Foundation, was attended by hundreds of people seeking solace and an end to gun violence.\n\nHeslin, who had previously advocated for stricter gun laws, stated, \"I'm not here for any political reason. I'm just here to honor Jesse.\" He found peace at the cathedral during Easter and hoped to find it again during the vigil.\n\nFollowing three minutes of church bells tolling in honor of the 30,000 people killed by gun violence over the past year, a series of multi-faith leaders offered prayers for an end to the violence. Rev. Mel Kawakami of the Newtown United Methodist Church said, \"We gather to say 'No more.'\" Dr. Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education, added, \"America must not allow these kinds of massacres...to take place. Only then can we call this nation a perfect union.\"\n\nRelatives of victims from various shootings, including the Empire State Building in New York and the Aurora, Colorado, theater massacre, shared their stories and expressed their pain. Anthony Hardmon, 15, whose 19-year-old sister, Ashley, was shot to death five months ago near their Chicago home, said, \"We stand with you through your trials and hard times. You're not alone.\"\n\nSome speakers urged stricter gun control legislation, both at the local level and in Washington. Rev. Gary Hall, the dean of the National Cathedral, who plans to dedicate this Sunday's sermon to victims of gun violence, called for \"moral courage and political will to lead us all to a new, safer era in American history.\"\n\nInside the cathedral, TV monitors displayed a constant loop of gun violence victims. Outside, a group of women wore sashes made from yellow and black tape, similar to police tape, that read \"Stop Gun Violence.\"\n\nBabe Healy King, who started the group after the Newtown massacre was a \"tipping point,\" expressed hope that the tape-wrapped trees in her Chevy Chase, Maryland, neighborhood would mobilize support for stiffer gun laws. \"People are numb (to gun violence),\" said King, 68. \"I hope there will be a huge explosion of people standing up and trying to make a difference.\"\n\nThe event was sponsored by the Newtown Foundation and the National Cathedral.",
    " Title: House Speaker Paul Ryan Secures Easy Primary Victory in Wisconsin\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) has secured a decisive victory in his primary race against businessman Paul Nehlen, with Ryan receiving a 5-1 margin of votes. The election took place on Tuesday, and Ryan attributed his win to his strong support in his home district.\n\nRyan rejected the idea that his easy win spells danger for Donald Trump's presidential prospects in the swing state of Wisconsin. He stated that the primary victory indicates his popularity in the district where he was born and raised and has represented since 1998.\n\nNehlen, who had been courting Trump supporters and won praise from the Republican presidential nominee last week, was unable to overcome Ryan's popularity despite the strained relationship between the two. Trump endorsed Ryan days later.\n\nRyan had largely ignored Nehlen in what had been a sleepy primary before Trump thanked Nehlen on Twitter for his comments defending Trump. Nehlen won the backing of some prominent conservative figures, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, but it was not enough to overcome Ryan's popularity in his southeastern Wisconsin district.\n\nRyan responded with a blitz of radio appearances and added a pair of campaign stops the day before the election, determined to avoid the fate that befell House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, when the Virginia Republican lost a primary to a little-known tea party challenger.\n\nMeanwhile, the primary's other top race was in northeastern Wisconsin, where GOP Rep. Reid Ribble's retirement opened a swing congressional seat. Mike Gallagher, a former Marine who served as national security adviser for Gov. Scott Walker's presidential campaign last year, handily defeated two opponents in the Republican primary.\n\nGallagher told The Associated Press that his campaign benefited from his being a political outsider. This was his first run for office, while his closest challenger, Sen. Frank Lasee, has been in the Legislature since 1995.\n\nRyan will face Democrat Ryan Solen, an Iraq war veteran, in the Nov. 8 general election. Three other congressional incumbents\u2014Democrats Gwen Moore and Ron Kind and Republican Sean Duffy\u2014all won.\n\nIn an unusual legislative race, incumbent Democratic state Sen. Lena Taylor easily dispatched with a challenge from state Rep. Mandela Barnes. No Republican was running in the Milwaukee race, making it all but certain Taylor would retain the seat.",

He has purchased a Times Square billboard that lists humorous reasons why he should be honored, such as \"Outstanding Achievement in Parroting George Soros' Talking Points\" and \"Least Breitbarty.\"\n\nTrevor Noah's \"Daily Show\" has also displayed a \"For Your Consideration\" graphic on its Twitter feed.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that these awards will win the president any votes or advance his agenda, they are expected to generate significant media coverage, appealing to his base, which already distrusts the press and enjoys the president's media-bashing.\n\nTrump's approach to his presidency is characterized by an hour-by-hour focus on programming, as evidenced by his Twitter feed and his ability to drive the narrative to new topics when he wishes to change the storyline. The media dishonesty awards are expected to be a brief distraction, but Trump is likely to enjoy the attention they generate.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Calls for Antitrust Legislation to Address Tech Companies' Alleged Censorship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Attorney General William Barr expressed concern over recent incidents where technology companies, including Google and Twitter, allegedly attempted to censor content. The interview, which aired on Sunday, followed reports of Google's apparent influence over NBC in punishing two conservative news sites for coverage deemed offensive during the protests following the death of George Floyd.\n\nGoogle, in response, stated that The Federalist was never demonetized and that they had worked with the site to address issues related to the comments section. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also mentioned that Twitter allegedly tried to censor his account for refusing to censor his tweets on the topic of riots and looting.\n\nAttorney General Barr explained that tech companies initially gained their strong market position by marketing themselves as open to all viewpoints, but have since started to censor different viewpoints. He noted the concentration of these large companies and their influence on the sharing of information and viewpoints in society.\n\nBarr expressed concern that this concentration of power allows for the quick galvanization of public opinion by presenting one viewpoint and pushing the public in a particular direction. He stated that the Constitution's foundation is based on a wide diversity of voices, and the current situation with the Internet and these big concentrations of power could lead to the oppression of minorities.\n\nBarr suggested that the antitrust laws could be used to address companies engaging in monopolistic practices. The Department of Justice is pushing for new legislation that would hold Facebook, Twitter, and other tech giants accountable for content posted on their platforms, potentially rolling back protections that Silicon Valley has enjoyed for decades.\n\nThe Justice Department's proposals aim to update the outdated immunity for online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The DOJ is calling for lawmakers to address the outdated immunity, with Bartiromo asking, \"What prompted this?\" Barr responded by stating that problems with Section 230 were arising, and they have proposed changes to address that.\n\nBarr explained that in the early days of the Internet, tech companies were encouraged to take down obscene or offensive material, but they should not be considered publishers under Section 230 if they do so. However, he noted that tech companies have started taking down viewpoints and being selective based on whether they agree with a viewpoint or not, which should make them publishers.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced legislation on Wednesday that would give Americans the ability to sue major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter if they engage in selective censorship of political speech.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates' Performance in Second Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second Democratic primary debate saw a mix of performances from the candidates, with some rising to the occasion while others struggled to meet expectations.\n\nNew Jersey Senator Cory Booker was praised for his strong showing, balancing attacks on former Vice President Joe Biden with an optimistic demeanor. Booker spoke powerfully about criminal justice reform and immigration, and made a notable point regarding the need for more ambitious action on climate change.\n\nSenator Booker also criticized Biden for trying to take credit for former President Barack Obama's achievements while distancing himself from the Obama legacy when it is politically convenient.\n\nIn the healthcare debate, both Biden and Senator Kamala Harris faced challenges. Harris has struggled to provide clear answers on key questions, while Biden appeared to mix up copays with deductibles in one of his answers. The core disagreement between the two remained the same: Harris wants to fundamentally overhaul the system to cover everyone, while Biden wants to build on the current system to cover many more, but not all, people.\n\nSenator Harris was unable to replicate her dominating performance from the first debate, and her answers on healthcare continued to sound unclear. Both Harris and Booker are in a position where they need Biden to falter, but for the moment, that isn't happening.\n\nBiden was described as \"perfectly adequate,\" with some criticizing his eloquence, rehearsed delivery, and understanding of modern technology. However, he was praised for his energy and preparation, which was a marked improvement from his lifeless performance at the first debate.\n\nThe candidates were quick to praise Obama the man, despite running against certain Obama policies. It is surprising to see Obama almost discarded as a party asset, given that he remains very popular and is still liked by almost nine in ten Democrats. The Democratic Party is moving leftward, but the candidate who is tying himself most closely to Obama, Joe Biden, continues to lead the polls.",
    " Title: China Plans to Deploy Nuclear-Armed Submarines in the Pacific Amid South China Sea Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nChina is reportedly planning to send nuclear-armed submarines for patrols in the Pacific Ocean for the first time, according to The Guardian, citing Chinese military officials. The timing for the maiden patrol has not been determined, but Beijing insists that such action is inevitable.\n\nThe announcement comes days after U.S. President Barack Obama lifted a decades-long arms embargo against Vietnam. Chinese officials have publicly praised the move, but a state-run newspaper warned that any attempt to enlist Vietnam in an effort to contain China could risk turning the region into a \"tinderbox of conflicts.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry responded Monday by stating that it was China's actions in the South and East China Seas that could create a tinderbox. \"I would caution China to not unilaterally move to engage in reclamation activities and militarization of islands,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon reports that China has reclaimed more than 3,200 acres of land in the South China Sea and is developing and building military installations on the man-made islands. As a consequence, the U.S. and Vietnam have steadily strengthened their relationship in recent years, in line with growing Vietnamese concern over Chinese moves to assert its maritime claims.\n\nDespite China and Vietnam being Communist countries, clashes in 1988 over their conflicting claims in the South China Sea resulted in the deaths of dozens of people. Tensions re-emerged in 2014, when China parked an oil rig off Vietnam's central coast, sparking confrontations at sea and deadly anti-China riots in Vietnam.\n\nLast week, the Pentagon reported that two Chinese fighter jets flew within about 50 feet of a U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane in what was termed an \"unsafe intercept.\" China responded by demanding that the U.S. end surveillance patrols around the South China Sea, with a foreign ministry spokesman claiming that such missions \"seriously endanger Chinese maritime security.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed within 12 miles of China's Fiery Cross reef, an artificial island made after months of dredging operations. It was the third time the Navy sailed a warship close to a contested Chinese island in what the Pentagon calls \"freedom of navigation\" operations. Beijing responded by scrambling fighter jets to show its displeasure.",
    " Title: Trump's Actions Prompt Constitutional Concerns as He Pushes for Inquiry into FBI's Alleged Campaign Infiltration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised constitutional concerns and sparked a political storm, President Donald Trump has initiated an inquiry into claims that the FBI infiltrated his 2016 campaign, a controversy first propagated in conservative media. The President delivered his order for the investigation to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during an Oval Office meeting on Monday.\n\nIn a strategic maneuver, Rosenstein may have temporarily defused Trump's anger by requesting the Department of Justice's inspector general to look into the President's claim. Top Justice Department officials will also share highly classified information with lawmakers regarding the Russia investigation.\n\nThe meeting's occurrence underscores the extraordinary times in Trump's Washington, where a President has turned against his own Justice Department and incites his political followers to do the same, potentially escalating the confrontation.\n\nMichael Hayden, a former director of the CIA and the National Security Agency under presidents of both parties, expressed concern over the recent events, describing them as \"a little scary.\"\n\n\"Our President is more limited by norms than he is (by the) Constitution or law. It is the traditions of the office that keep the President, I think, in his lane,\" Hayden said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nHayden further stated that Trump's actions have stepped so far beyond these norms that \"people lose confidence in the independence of the judiciary, which frankly is our only off-ramp from this overhang currently over the entire nation,\" referring to the Russia investigation.\n\nQuestions surrounding Trump's actions include whether he is using his power to subvert an investigation into his own alleged misconduct, and whether a sitting President could potentially use the weight of his office to launch investigations into political enemies\u2014an unprecedented step.\n\nTrump, who intensified the crisis with a weekend of rampant tweeting, may be temporarily mollified by Rosenstein's move. However, given his persistent pressure on the Justice Department and the FBI, it's almost certain the showdown will flare up again soon. In fact, it seems to be in Trump's interests to keep the fire burning.\n\nIn an extraordinary step on Monday, the Trump campaign sent out a campaign blast email to supporters, urging them to sign a petition to force an investigation into \"whether Obama's FBI and DOJ infiltrated or surveilled our campaign for political purposes.\"\n\n\"This could be the greatest political scandal in American history,\" the email, signed by Trump, declared in block capitals.\n\nThe email appears to be the most overt sign yet of how Trump and his allies are building a political campaign to tarnish special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, apparently designed to discredit any eventual findings of wrongdoing by the President.\n\nDemocrats immediately denounced the move as a symptom of a President acting out of control.\n\n\"That he would issue such an absurd and abusive demand based on no evidence shows just how little regard the President has for the rule of law,\" said Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \"President Trump seems to have the terribly misguided view that the Department of Justice is there to protect his political interests and prosecute his enemies.\"\n\nEven some of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill are uncomfortable with his latest turn. Utah's GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch told CNN's Manu Raju that \"the question is whether it's advisable or not.\"\n\n\"You know, the Justice Department has been a pretty honest department all these years. As far as I'm concerned, he's got to leave it up to the Justice Department,\" Hatch said.\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper reported that a loose and informal group of Trump advisers outside the White House have been pushing the President to attack Rosenstein and to frame him as part of a \"deep state\" plot against the White House. The campaign is using Trump-friendly media and the President to force Rosenstein to reveal details about the investigation that both the Justice Department and FBI do not want disclosed.\n\nCNN has reported that the FBI did not insert an informant into the Trump campaign. Rather, the use of an asset is standard practice in counterintelligence operations\u2014in this case, it was likely intended to gather information from campaign advisers who may have been the targets of a Russian espionage operation.\n\nThe fact that there is no evidence that the FBI, the Justice Department, or senior Obama officials came up with a \"spy\" scheme does not matter in this context\u2014this is an active political campaign rather than a legal defense to the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"We are eroding the reality and the appearance of the independence of the judiciary and the Department of Justice and the special counsel,\" Hayden concluded.",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions Cites Bible Passage in Defense of Immigration Policy, Sparks Debate Among Religious Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nIndianapolis \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions, while speaking in Fort Wayne on Thursday, sparked a heated debate on immigration and the interpretation of a Bible passage when he cited a chapter in Romans to defend the Trump administration's policy of separating parents from their children at the border. The policy has been widely denounced by religious leaders, immigration advocates, and others.\n\nSessions, who is also a Sunday school teacher at a United Methodist Church in Mobile, Alabama, said, \"I would cite you to the apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order.\"\n\nThe first three verses of Romans 13 in the Common English Bible, traditionally used by the United Methodist Church, read:\n\n1. Every person should place themselves under the authority of the government. There isn\u2019t any authority unless it comes from God, and the authorities that are there have been put in place by God.\n2. So anyone who opposes the authority is standing against what God has established. People who take this kind of stand will get punished.\n3. The authorities don\u2019t frighten people who are doing the right thing. Rather, they frighten people who are doing wrong. Would you rather not be afraid of authority? Do what\u2019s right, and you will receive its approval.\n\nHowever, some who share Sessions' faith disagree with his interpretation of the passage. Mike Mather, the senior pastor at Broadway UMC in Indianapolis, said, \"It was terrible.\" He added, \"If you read the first 11 chapters of Romans, you get a pretty good idea of what the context of that community was. If you read (Chapter) 12, you see love is supposed to be the guiding force...(Sessions) did not read on very far.\"\n\nRomans 12 includes the line, \"Contribute to the needs of God\u2019s people, and welcome strangers into your home.\" Those verses, Mather said, seem to run contrary to the policy Sessions was defending. Launched in May, the policy forcibly removes children traveling with parents caught at the border and places them in government care.\n\nSessions said the goal of the policy is not \"to see if we can be mean to children.\" He said the point is to crack down on potential child trafficking or abuse and discourage parents from bringing their children on the often-dangerous border crossing.\n\nOn Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a conservative Christian, answered a question about Sessions' comments, saying, \"It is very biblical to enforce the law.\"\n\nHowever, public backing for the policy\u2014and the religious argument that Sessions used to support it\u2014has been hard to come by.\n\nRomans 13 has a history of being used by government officials in defense of their decisions or edicts. The Rev. Rob Saler, executive director for the Center for Pastoral Excellence at Indianapolis' Christian Theological Seminary, said the verses were used by Lutherans in Nazi Germany to justify supporting Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"Romans 13, for a long time, has been appealed to in an incorrect way, as a justification for 'Obey the laws, no matter what,'\" he said. \"Whether they're just or not. I don\u2019t want to be too extreme, but...in Nazi Germany, Lutherans, for the most part, supported Hitler and they used Romans 13 to validate that.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah College in Pennsylvania, said the verse was also used to support slavery in the 1840s and 1850s.\n\n\"(It) is invoked by defenders of the South or defenders of slavery to ward off abolitionists who believed that slavery is wrong,\" he said. \"I mean, this is the same argument that Southern slaveholders and the advocates of a Southern way of life made.\"\n\nSaler noted that it's important to consider when Paul wrote Romans. At that time, Christians were being executed by the Roman Empire, he said. What Paul was penning, Saler added, was meant to be a road map to living a gentler life full of charity, a stark contrast to how Paul would have viewed the empire.\n\n\"It's flat-out irresponsible (for Sessions) to use it without attention to the broader context,\" Saler said. \"It's basically practical advice: While you're doing this, sure, go ahead and pay your taxes, give the government its due.\n\n\"But taken as a whole, Romans stands as a counter to unjust government and unjust rule.\"\n\nMather, who has served at UMC Broadway for 15 years, echoed that sentiment. When he learned Sessions had been a Sunday school teacher, he chuckled.\n\n\"I didn't know he'd been a Sunday school teacher, but I think this would be a bad interpretation to give to kids, or anyone for that matter,\" Mather said. \"I'm constantly surprised by people who argue that they're Christians, but don't seem to know the essence of our faith.\"",
    " Title: Comparative Analysis: Biden's South Carolina Strategy Mirrors Jeb Bush's in 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a striking resemblance to the 2016 Republican contender, former Vice President Joe Biden, during his presidential campaign, shares many similarities with Jeb Bush, particularly in their strategies during the South Carolina primary.\n\nLike Biden, Bush was closely associated with his party's last president, George W. Bush. Both led in early polls and struggled in debates. In the case of Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush came in sixth and fourth, respectively, while Biden faced similar results in the same primaries this year. Both candidates staked their candidacies on a comeback in South Carolina.\n\nBush's strategy in South Carolina mirrored Biden's recent approach, positioning himself as the defender of his party's old guard. At a debate in South Carolina, Bush contrasted the insurgent Donald Trump's nativist stance with former President George W. Bush's more welcoming message. He defended immigrants, stating, \"The great majority of immigrants are coming to provide for their families. And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling.\"\n\nBush also defended his brother's response to 9/11 during the debate, countering Trump's accusations of lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. \"While Donald Trump was building a reality-TV show,\" Bush retorted, \"my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I'm proud of what he did.\"\n\nThe younger Bush, according to The New York Times, \"seems to be embracing his inner dynast, joking about his family in speeches, pointing out relatives in his crowds, and going out of his way to speak with pride about his father's and brother's achievements.\" Two days before the South Carolina primary, he brought his brother to campaign, with George W. Bush stating, \"If serving as president of the United States makes me part of the so-called establishment, I proudly wear that label.\"\n\nBiden, in this year's campaign, has also adopted a similar strategy. Although he failed to secure Barack Obama's endorsement, Biden has made his relationship with the former president the centerpiece of his South Carolina campaign. His surrogates have repeatedly used Obama's campaign chant, \"Fired up, ready to go.\" The former vice president frequently references the \"Obama-Biden\" administration in speeches and uses Obama as a battering ram against his opponents.\n\nThe results, however, could not have been more different. Bush lost to Trump in South Carolina by 25 points and quickly dropped out of the race. In contrast, Biden beat Sanders by 29 points and, buoyed by a new series of high-profile endorsements, went on to beat him in a series of other states last night.",
    " Title: Obama Administration and House Republicans Remain Far Apart in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing discussions regarding the \"fiscal cliff,\" President Obama and his White House team seem to have drawn a clear position on the issue of tax rates for the wealthy. The only question that remains is the extent of the increase. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, in an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" stated unequivocally that \"those rates are going to have to go up.\" He further emphasized that maintaining low tax rates in the current climate of significant threats and challenges is irresponsible for future generations.\n\nHowever, the president's plan, as presented last week by Geithner, has left the two sides significantly apart. In a conversation on \"Fox News Sunday,\" House Speaker John Boehner expressed his surprise, stating, \"I was flabbergasted. I looked at him and said, 'You can't be serious.'\" Boehner added, \"The president's idea of negotiation is: Roll over and do what I ask.\"\n\nThe president's proposal seeks an additional $1.6 trillion in tax revenue over the next 10 years, including a return of the tax rate on income above $250,000 per year to 39.6 percent. In exchange, the president suggests $600 billion in cuts to Medicare and other programs. House Republicans argue that this is not sufficient, but have not publicly detailed their proposed cuts.\n\nGeithner stated that the ball is now in the Republicans' court, and the White House appears content to wait for the Republicans to present their proposals. \"They have to come to us and tell us what they think they need. What we can't do is to keep guessing,\" he said.\n\nThe president is also advocating for additional stimulus spending totaling $200 billion for unemployment benefits, training, and infrastructure projects. House Speaker Boehner commented that this stimulus spending would exceed the spending cuts the president was willing to propose.\n\nBoehner also expressed skepticism over the president's proposal to remove Congress's power over the country's debt limit. \"Congress is not going to give up this power,\" he said. \"It's the only way to leverage the political process to produce more change than what it would if left alone.\"\n\nThe \"fiscal cliff,\" a combination of automatic tax increases and spending cuts, is set to take effect on Jan. 1 if Congress and the White House do not reach a deficit-cutting agreement beforehand. Economists predict that the average family will face a loss of between $2,000 and $2,400 per year due to the tax increases, coupled with the $500 billion in spending cuts, could potentially push the country back into recession.",
    " Title: Joe Biden Recounts 1960s Dormitory Incident During Ohio University Visit in 2008\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 2008 clip resurfaced recently, Joe Biden, then the Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's running mate, recounted an incident from over 40 years prior when he was attending a football game between the University of Delaware and Ohio University. During his speech to supporters near Ohio University's campus, Biden joked about being arrested for mistakenly entering an all-female dormitory.\n\nAccording to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Biden made the playful admission on the \"Political Ticker\" program. He said he was attending a football game between his university and Ohio University, and he followed a group of women into the dormitory, which was not allowed at the time. Biden joked that the incident was only a temporary detention.\n\nCBS News also published an article on the same day about Biden's remarks. In the article, Biden recalled wandering into the dormitory and being arrested by a police officer because men were not allowed in women's dormitories back then. Biden emphasized that he never breached the first floor and that the detention was only temporary.\n\nThe incident was also documented on a CNN Political Ticker blog, which reported that Biden's remarks were nearly identical to the CBS News report. The blog post also mentioned that Biden was visiting Ohio University to speak to supporters and that he had fond memories of the university's beautiful town.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588, a leading provider of conservative news, reported on the incident, highlighting the story's importance and relevance to readers.

    " Title: U.S. Attorney General Nominee Loretta Lynch Discusses Immigration and Law Enforcement during Senate Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a Senate confirmation hearing on January 28, 2014, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, and U.S. Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch engaged in a discussion regarding immigration and employment rights.\n\nSessions questioned Lynch, stating, \"In the workplace of America today when we have a high number of unemployed, we\u2019ve had declining wages for many years, we have the lowest of Americans working, who has more right to a job in this country? A lawful immigrant who\u2019s here, a green-card holder or a citizen, or a person who entered the country unlawfully?\"\n\nLynch responded, \"I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that\u2019s shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. Certainly, if someone here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace.\"\n\nSessions continued the discussion, asking, \"We\u2019re talking about rights\u2014who has the most rights? Does a lawful American immigrant or citizen have the right to have the laws of the United States enforced so that they might be able to work, or does a person who came here unlawfully have a right to demand a job?\"\n\nLynch countered, \"Certainly, the benefits of citizenship confer greater rights on those of who are citizens than those\u2014than those who are not.\"\n\nLater in the hearing, Lynch spoke about the challenges faced by law enforcement officers and the importance of community engagement. She stated, \"With respect to our brave law enforcement officers, we ask so much of them. We ask them to keep us safe. We ask them to protect us literally from ourselves, and we ask them to do it often without the resources that they need to be safe and secure themselves. Yet they still stand up every day and risk their lives for us. Many of our community residents, because of a host of factors, feel disconnected from government in general today, and when they interact with law enforcement, transfer that feeling to them as well, even if someone is there to help.\"\n\nShe continued, \"What I have found most effective is getting people together and simply listening to their concerns, being open, helping them see that, in fact, we are all in this together and that the concerns of law enforcement, a safe society, a free society are the exact same concerns of every resident of every community there.\"",
    " Title: ACLU's Temporary Tweet on Catcalling Ban Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) appeared to advocate for a ban on catcalling, a move that would potentially infringe upon the First Amendment rights. However, the tweet was swiftly deleted, but a screenshot of the post remains.\n\nA U.S. ban on catcalling, defined as street harassment of women, would likely conflict with the First Amendment, unless the law is narrowly tailored to prohibit severe, pervasive, objectively offensive conduct or threatening behavior. Even then, the Supreme Court might strike it down, as seen in the Snyder v. Phelps case.\n\nThe ACLU's call for a catcalling ban could be seen as a significant blow to civil liberties and may undermine other important goals, such as criminal justice reform. In the U.S., the government would disproportionately arrest poor people, immigrants, and people of color for catcalling.\n\nIt is important to note that a single tweet does not necessarily indicate a broad shift in the ACLU's thinking. Most likely, this was the action of a social media editor. The author expresses surprise that such a person, who seems to be unclear about the ACLU's core values, would manage the ACLU's Twitter feed.\n\nThe author previously expressed concern that the American Civil Liberties Union may be wavering on its unwavering commitment to free speech. This concern seems to be confirmed by the stray tweet. The author's fear is that free speech is becoming a secondary concern for the ACLU, with generic lefty social justice goals taking precedence. The notion that the organization would vehemently oppose catcalling legislation is no longer obvious to the ACLU's employees; they view it as a progressive organization, not a civil liberties organization.",
    " Title: California Democratic Party's Shift: A Look at Dianne Feinstein's Contested Senate Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political landscape that has significantly evolved over the past three decades, the California Democratic Party has shown a marked shift in its ideological stance, as evidenced by the recent convention where incumbent Senator Dianne Feinstein failed to secure the party's endorsement for a fifth term in the U.S. Senate. Feinstein, who lost a gubernatorial race to Republican Pete Wilson in 1990 due to perceived left-leaning views, is now facing criticism from within her own party.\n\nFeinstein, often characterized as a centrist Democrat, has a reliably left-of-center voting record. According to the American Conservative Union's most recent congressional rankings, she scored an 8, with a lifetime rating of 9.15. On the other hand, left-leaning Americans for Democratic Action gives Feinstein an 85 rating. Her ratings have varied over the years, with scores of 75 in 2015, 90 in 2014, 100 in 2013, and a 95 in 2012.\n\nDespite this reliably left-wing voting record, Feinstein's support within the California Democratic Party has waned. This shift is attributed to the party's perceived leftward swing, with State Senator Kevin de Le\u00f3n gaining popularity due to his harder stance against the Trump administration and his portrayal as a young, energetic leader. De Le\u00f3n, who nearly won the endorsement, was serenaded with chants of \"Your time is up! Your time is up!\" at the end of Feinstein's speech during the convention.\n\nThe California Democratic Party's shift could potentially impact the state's electoral landscape, with concerns that the party's leftward swing may resonate with voters, leading to further political and economic challenges. Since the Golden State became the \"Cerulean State,\" public-employee pensions have become a fiscal concern, taxation has increased, businesses have fled due to a hostile commercial and regulatory environment, the middle class is shrinking, the poverty rate is the nation's highest, and the state's quality of life has been ranked the worst in the nation. The state's homeless problem is a national embarrassment, its housing crisis remains unaddressed, and its public school system is failing students and parents.\n\nIf the Democratic Party's leftward swing indeed resonates with voters, California could face challenges similar to those experienced by Rust Belt states in the 1980s, with economies, prospects, and populations receding at alarming rates. This potential future is a cause for concern, as the state grapples with a myriad of pressing issues.",
    " Title: DNC Forms Cybersecurity Advisory Board in Response to Email Leaks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has established a cybersecurity advisory board in response to the hack attack that led to the leak of thousands of internal party emails online, according to Politico. The four-member board was announced by interim chairwoman Donna Brazile in a memo, following her appointment as DNC chief last month after the publication of stolen emails resulted in the ousting of former chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nIn the memo, Ms. Brazile stated, \"To prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC's cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class, I am creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board composed of distinguished experts in the field.\" The board will work closely with the DNC to ensure the party is prepared for cyber threats.\n\nThe decision to form the board is a direct response to what Ms. Brazile described as an \"illegal cyber attack by state-sponsored Russian hackers,\" according to the Wall Street Journal. Federal investigators believe the DNC was one of several entities associated with the Democratic Party to be successfully targeted by hackers widely assumed to be agents of the Russian government.\n\nIn addition to the release of emails that led to Ms. Wasserman Schultz's stepping down, other emails published by WikiLeaks last month included credit-card data and other sensitive information concerning DNC staffers and their contacts. The DNC has promised to provide assistance to those affected by the data breach.\n\nThe inaugural members of the new DNC board, according to Politico, include Rand Beers, former acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Nicole Wong, a former technology lawyer for Google and Twitter; Aneesh Copra, co-founder of Hunch Analytics; and Michael Sussmann, a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor.

    " Title: Trump, Health Advisers Differ on Timeline for Easing Social Distancing Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and two of his top public health advisers have expressed differing views on the timeline for easing social distancing measures and reopening businesses.\n\nTrump, in a recent interview with Fox News, stated that his decision on when to adjust federal social distancing guidelines and ask businesses to reopen would be based on \"a lot of facts and a lot of instincts.\" However, two of his health advisers, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Stephen Hahn, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, have advocated for a decision based solely on data.\n\nIn separate appearances on CNN's State of the Union and ABC's Meet the Press, both officials emphasized that their recommendations would be based on constantly changing data and were hesitant to make firm or sweeping predictions. They also challenged the notion of a single, set time when the entire country will be \"ready\" to resume normal life.\n\nDr. Fauci stated on CNN that the reopening process would depend on the severity of the outbreak in different areas and would not be a simple on-off switch. Dr. Hahn, in a separate interview, declined to set a specific date for the decision, stating that it was too early to tell if May 1 would be the appropriate time to reopen the economy.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed a desire to see relaxed social distancing and businesses reopened as soon as possible. In late March, he stated that he hoped to have the economy \"opened up and raring to go by Easter,\" a goal that both health officials and economists warned would accelerate the spread of the coronavirus and likely lead to a rapid reshuttering of the economy.\n\nTrump has signaled his intention to create a concrete plan to see the economy functioning as normal again. He plans to announce the members of a new \"opening our country task force\" or \"opening our country council\" this week, consisting of \"great business leaders, great doctors, and some governors.\"\n\nEvery day, \u2588\u2588\u2588 aims to answer your most important questions and provide information that has the power to save lives.

    " Title: Senate Republican Estimates Potential Cost of Legalizing Illegal Immigrants in Billions, Rubio Disputes Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republican staffers have estimated that the annual cost to taxpayers of legalizing illegal immigrants could be in the billions, if they use their status to apply for federal benefits from Medicaid and ObamaCare. This claim, however, was challenged by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a key Republican engaged in immigration bill talks.\n\nResponding to an emerging immigration proposal that includes a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants, Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee estimated that the cost could total up to $40 billion in 2022, \"just for Medicaid and ObamaCare.\" The estimates were crunched by budget committee Republican staff.\n\nAlex Conant, spokesman for Sen. Rubio, disputed the numbers, stating in a late Thursday statement that it's not possible to provide cost estimates since a legislative proposal has not yet been introduced. Conant added that Rubio is concerned about the \"potential fiscal impact\" of the bill and will request an \"in-depth\" budget analysis.\n\nRubio, a key member of the \"Gang of Eight\" drafting a proposal, has stressed that he would ensure there are limits on benefits being applied to these individuals. In January, he told a news outlet that the first phase for them would be to get a nonimmigrant visa\u2014not a green card\u2014and \"you don't qualify for any federal benefits under that.\" Their eligibility, though, would change once they get a green card.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions' office voiced concern Thursday that a law\u2014which dates back a century and was renewed by Congress in 1996\u2014meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. only to live on the government dole would not be applied here. The office claimed that nothing in the current plan would apply to those already in the country before they are granted legal status.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security recently reported that the \"public charge\" standard, which is supposed to turn away those immigrants who are likely to become a \"public charge,\" is not aggressively enforced. The department found just one case for most of fiscal 2012 where the claim was leveled at an immigrant, but the charge was later withdrawn. The department blamed \"data entry quality\" for not having complete information on how many immigrants became public charges.\n\nDespite widespread reports and speculation about the immigration bill being drafted, a bill has not yet been introduced. Senators are working out the details in hopes of bringing it before Congress in the coming weeks.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Positions Herself as Liberal Democratic Front-Runner, Moves Left on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is pursuing a liberal platform in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, aiming to capture the young and diverse coalition that propelled President Barack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n\nClinton's campaign has strategically positioned her to the left on various issues, including gay marriage, immigration, and climate change, among others. This shift, as stated by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, is not about finding an ideal ideological position but rather addressing the challenges faced by American people and families.\n\nClinton's advisers believe that her stance on issues such as paid family leave, a higher minimum wage, and more affordable college will resonate with the public, while minimizing concerns about her hawkish foreign policy views. She has also taken liberal positions on climate change, abortion rights, and economic inequality.\n\nBy adopting such positions, Clinton's advisers aim to avoid a significant challenge from the left while garnering support through the general election. According to The Washington Post, conservative America Rising PAC director Colin Reed wrote in a position paper that Clinton's positioning could backfire, reinforcing her worst attributes as a candidate and hurting her image among voters of all stripes.\n\nPolitical strategists have expressed mixed opinions about Clinton's ability to replicate Obama's coalition, particularly among nonwhite voters. However, they predict that her positions will draw strong support. Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress and a longtime Clinton confidant, told The Washington Post that the Democrats have a strategic advantage due to the shorter distance between their base and the middle compared to the Republicans.\n\nClinton has not yet taken positions on the Keystone XL pipeline or Obama's free trade deal, according to The Washington Post. Her advisers predict that her silence on these issues will not harm her standing, the report said.",
    " Title: Democrats Argue for Nationwide Subsidies in Affordable Care Act Case\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Democrats involved in drafting the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, have stated their intention for consumers in all states to be eligible for subsidies. In a brief filed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday, they argued that excluding some states would contradict the law's purpose of making health insurance affordable for all Americans.\n\nThe case, known as King v. Burwell, could potentially undermine the economic assumptions that the law relies on. The court case rests on language in the law that states subsidies will be paid to those in exchanges \"established by the state.\"\n\nOpponents argue that this language means the federal exchange, which covers the two-thirds of states that refused to set up their own exchanges, are not eligible for subsidies. They claim that Congress intended to use the subsidies as an incentive for states to set up exchanges rather than leaving the job to federal officials.\n\nHowever, the Democratic lawmakers who wrote and passed the law argue that this interpretation is \"so weak\" and that they never intended to draw such a distinction. They contend that the law grants subsidies to \"applicable taxpayers\" and defines them by income, not by geography.\n\nPart of the problem Democrats face is the convoluted way the law was passed. Senate Democrats forced their bill through on Christmas Eve in 2009, expecting to work out differences with the House, which passed a different bill. However, the victory of Scott Brown in a special Senate election in Massachusetts cost Democrats their filibuster-proof majority, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had to resort to using budget gimmicks to force the bill through exactly as it passed the Senate.\n\nOpponents have pointed to former Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat who was one of the key final votes to get the bill through the Senate in that Christmas Eve vote and who insisted that states be able to set up their own exchanges. They argue that the subsidies were created as an incentive to get states to set up exchanges.\n\nHowever, Senator Nelson wrote a letter dated Tuesday stating, \"I always believed that tax credits should be available in all 50 states regardless of who built the exchange, and the final law also reflects that belief as well.\"",
    " Title: Swing Votes on Kavanaugh Nomination Appear to Have Made Up Their Minds\n\nArticle:\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, all five senators considered to be swing votes in the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court have indicated their voting intentions. The latest developments suggest that Kavanaugh's nomination will likely pass in the Senate, given the Republicans' razor-thin 51-49 majority.\n\nThe focus was on Republican Sens. Jeff Flake, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, as well as Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin. Their collective votes would be crucial in determining whether Kavanaugh is ultimately confirmed.\n\nBy Friday, all five senators have now expressed their voting intentions. Heitkamp and Murkowski are expected to vote against Kavanaugh, while Flake, Collins, and Manchin have signaled their support.\n\nSen. Susan Collins announced on Friday that she will be voting in favor of Kavanaugh. She had hinted at her decision on Thursday, expressing confidence in the FBI report on sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. Collins stated that she would personally review the FBI report, but as of Friday afternoon, she had not yet finished going through all the materials.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake also indicated his intention to vote in support of Kavanaugh, unless circumstances change before the floor vote. Flake echoed Collins in his reaction to the FBI report, stating that it was thorough but did not contain new corroborative information. Flake was at the forefront of calls for a one-week delay on a Kavanaugh vote, which would allow the FBI to conduct an investigation. He voted in favor of limiting debate on the nomination and advancing Kavanaugh to a floor vote on Friday.\n\nIn a surprising turn, Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted against limiting debate on the nomination and advancing Kavanaugh to a floor vote on Friday. This vote is likely indicative of how she ultimately plans to vote on Kavanaugh. Murkowski stated, \"I believe Brett Kavanaugh is a good man, but it may be that in my view, he's not the right man for the court at this time.\" Previously, Murkowski had been more cautious about revealing her voting intentions, stating that she was still working on reading the entirety of the FBI report herself.\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp has not yet made a public statement regarding her voting intentions, but it is expected that she will oppose Kavanaugh's nomination. Sen. Joe Manchin has also not made a public statement, but it is expected that he will support Kavanaugh's nomination.",
    " Title: House Republicans Question Obama Administration's Authority in Delaying Health Care Law Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans are intensifying their examination of the decision to postpone a significant aspect of the health care overhaul, raising questions about the Obama administration's authority to bypass the law without Congress's approval.\n\nLast week, the administration announced a one-year delay of a requirement that large employers offer health insurance access. Officials described the delay as a pragmatic concession to businesses who found the rules burdensome, and maintained the Treasury Department was acting within its rights.\n\nA Treasury official told FoxNews.com that the move was an exercise of administrative authority under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code. The official stated that the department has \"longstanding\" authority to \"grant transition relief when implementing new legislation\" like the health care law.\n\nA number of Republicans view the sudden change as a sign of potential issues with the comprehensive health care law. However, as lawmakers return from the holiday break, they are also challenging whether the adjustment was an abuse of power.\n\nRep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) stated, \"This action raises a lot of questions about whether the Obama administration can simply ignore the law when it's convenient for them.\" He has requested the Congressional Research Service to \"investigate\" this issue, stating, \"I don't think any president has the authority to pick and choose what parts of the law to follow.\"\n\nThe matter will be discussed on Capitol Hill later this week. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee, has scheduled a hearing for July 10, which will, in part, examine the administration's authority to alter the law.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, went a step further, describing the move as \"another in a string of extra-legal actions taken\" by the Obama administration.\n\nThe complaint about the administration's authority is just one of several concerns Republicans have regarding the delay of the mandate. They question whether further delays and changes will occur before the January 1 launch of many of the law's major provisions. They also question why the individual mandate\u2014the requirement for individuals to purchase health insurance\u2014was not also delayed.\n\nHowever, the Treasury Department and White House, in announcing the delay last week, explained that they did so after businesses complained about the reporting requirements. As the administration works to simplify the rules, they stated, they would provide businesses more time to comply.\n\n\"We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,\" said Mark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury, last week on the Treasury blog.",
    " Title: The Navy Yard Massacre and the Sterility of the Gun Control Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Navy Yard massacre in Washington D.C. has not rekindled the gun control debate in Congress, as the author notes, due to the impracticality of gun control measures that would have prevented the incident. The implication is that the massacre, committed with a shotgun, demonstrates the inherent limitations of the gun control debate.\n\nInitially, erroneous reports from law enforcement led to the assumption that an AR-15, a popular rifle often used in mass shootings, was the weapon used in the attack. However, it has since been confirmed that Aaron Alexis, the perpetrator, used a shotgun during his rampage.\n\nMedia outlets, such as the Daily News, rushed to blame the AR-15 for the attack, with columnist Mike Lupica expressing outrage over the gun. Lupica's column would have been inaccurate if an AR-15 had been the murder weapon, as hundreds of thousands of them are bought annually by people with no interest in killing innocent people.\n\nAlexis' choice of a shotgun, a weapon endorsed and promoted by Vice President Joe Biden, highlights the complexity of the gun control debate. Shotguns, like other firearms, can be dangerous, especially in permissive environments where few are armed. This undermines the belief that banning certain guns based on cosmetic features can reduce shooting rampages.\n\nOther common solutions, such as background checks, would have had no effect on the Navy Yard massacre. Alexis bought his shotgun from a licensed dealer, passed a federal background check, and did not possess a high-capacity magazine. He may have obtained the handgun or handguns used in the attack after shooting a security officer.\n\nThe essential sterility of the gun control debate is underscored by the fact that the Navy Yard massacre, like other mass shootings, was committed by a deeply disturbed individual. The focus on gun control, the article suggests, is misguided, as it overlooks the root cause of these tragedies: mental illness.\n\nThe article calls for a shift in the debate towards addressing mental illness, arguing that the current simplistic approach is akin to focusing on tinfoil hats to prevent radio wave-induced madness. The author suggests that if we had the same callous disregard for people suffering from Alzheimer's, they would be left to fend for themselves.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that there will be another Aaron Alexis, and that the mental state of the perpetrator, rather than the gun used, is the common thread in these tragedies. The article calls for a more nuanced approach to mental illness, emphasizing the need for easier access to treatment for the mentally ill to potentially reduce the occurrence of such incidents.",
    " Title: U.S. Weighs Response as Intelligence Suggests Syrian President Assad Used Chemical Weapons\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is considering various options for direct action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad following intelligence suggesting the use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war. President Barack Obama has previously warned that such actions would constitute a \"red line\" and a \"game changer.\"\n\nIn a letter to Congress on Thursday, the U.S. administration stated that U.S. intelligence officials believe, with varying degrees of confidence, that al-Assad has used the nerve agent sarin, based on the results of \"physiological samples.\" However, the administration did not immediately move towards military action, instead calling for a \"comprehensive United Nations investigation\" and the need to \"establish all the facts\" before deciding on a course of action.\n\nA White House official stated that \"all options are on the table in terms of our response,\" but declined to \"get into hypotheticals at this juncture.\" The official emphasized the need for a \"strong, firm, evidentiary basis to inform the way we consult our friends and allies.\"\n\nThe official also referenced the run-up to the invasion of Iraq as a reason for caution, stating, \"Given our own history of intelligence assessments, especially given intelligence assessments related to weapons of mass destruction, it's very important we are presenting the public with information that is airtight, presented in a public and credible fashion.\"\n\nSkepticism in Washington has arisen over the potential delay in action, with concerns that inaction or slow action might not only embarrass the U.S. for backing away from earlier rhetoric, but also lead to further atrocities by al-Assad.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner expressed concern, stating, \"I am deeply concerned with reports that further confirmation of use may be outsourced to the United Nations.\" He added, \"If Assad sees any equivocation on the red line, it will embolden his regime.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, shared similar concerns, stating, \"The'red line' has clearly been crossed, and 'action must be taken to prevent larger scale use.'\"\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, who called al-Assad's attack an \"astounding violation of human rights,\" questioned the utility of red lines if they lack clear boundaries and meaningful consequences.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel stated that he would be prepared to provide military options to Obama \"at such time as the president requires options,\" but also emphasized the need for investigation and consultation with allies.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Legislation Aims to Improve Wireless Networks in Rural America\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) on Tuesday seeks to enhance wireless networks in underserved rural areas of America. The Advancing Innovation and Reinvigorating Widespread Access to Viable Electromagnetic Spectrum (AIRWAVES) bill aims to open up spectrum space for commercial licensed and unlicensed use, with the goal of driving down wireless costs and increasing accessibility.\n\nThe senators believe this will bring increased broadband access to rural areas, whose connectivity coverage rates and speed lag significantly compared to urban areas. In a statement, Gardner said, \"This legislation offers innovative ways to avoid a spectrum crunch, pave the way for 5G service, and provide critical resources to rural America to continue rural buildout in unserved and underserved areas throughout Colorado and the country.\"\n\nCurrently, different bands of spectrum\u2014ranges of radio frequencies\u2014are used to transmit audio, video, and data by various groups. Broadcasters, for example, transmit TV signals over spectrum bands, while wireless providers use them to distribute wireless broadband.\n\nThe bill has received praise from technology trade associations, who argue it is necessary to help rural communities. In a statement, the Information Technology Industry Council\u2019s (ITI) Vice President of Government Affairs Vince Jesaitis applauded the bill, stating it would help the rollout of 5G high-speed wireless. Similarly, Kelly Cole, Senior Vice President for Government Affairs at CTIA, a trade association representing wireless companies, echoed this sentiment.\n\nHowever, some observers appreciate the bill's sentiment but call for improvements as it moves through the legislative process. Michael Calabrese, director of New America's Wireless Future Program, commended the bill but criticized its focus on a one-time auction of spectrum for wireless broadband distribution, arguing that opening other, additional underutilized bands of spectrum would be more effective.\n\nLawmakers and government officials in Washington, D.C., have made bridging the connectivity gap between rural and urban portions of America an increasingly large priority over the past year. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) have advocated for deploying better broadband in rural portions of their states. At the Federal Communications Commission, Chairman Ajit Pai has pushed for solutions that would make it easier for broadband companies to increase access to internet in rural areas. Many companies wouldn't otherwise have a financial incentive to create the expensive infrastructure to bring broadband to such areas.",
    " Title: U.S. Accuses Iran of Attacking Oil Tankers in Gulf of Oman; Iran Denies Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump stated on Friday that Iran was responsible for an attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. \"Iran did it,\" he said during a 50-minute interview on Fox News. \"It was them that did it.\" He also referred to Iran as \"a nation of terror.\"\n\nThe U.S. Navy rushed to assist the stricken vessels in the Gulf of Oman, off the coast of Iran, including one that was set ablaze Thursday by an explosion. The ships' operators offered no immediate explanation on who or what caused the damage against the Norwegian-owned MT Front Altair and the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, each loaded with petroleum products. The Front Altair burned for hours, sending up a column of thick, black smoke.\n\nThe U.S. military released a video that officials say shows Iran's Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded limpet mine from one of the oil tankers targeted near the Strait of Hormuz. The video suggests that the Islamic Republic sought to remove evidence of its involvement from the scene. Iran has denied being involved, accusing the U.S. instead of waging an \"Iranophobic campaign\" against it.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists on Thursday that the U.S. assessment of Iran's involvement was based in part on intelligence, as well as the expertise needed for the operation. It was also based on recent incidents in the region, which the U.S. also blamed on Iran, including the use of limpet mines in the Fujairah attack. U.S. oil prices could spike due to \"sporadic\" attacks from Iran, according to a U.S. think tank.\n\nIn Tokyo, the owner of the Kokuka Courageous said its sailors saw \"flying objects\" before the attack, suggesting it wasn't damaged by mines. Company president Yutaka Katada offered no evidence for his claim, which contradicts the U.S. military account. Katada also said crew members saw an Iranian naval ship nearby, but did not specify whether this was before or after the attacks.\n\nThe suspected attacks occurred at dawn Thursday about 40 kilometers (25 miles) off the southern coast of Iran. The Front Altair, loaded with the flammable hydrocarbon mixture naphtha from the United Arab Emirates, radioed for help as it caught fire. A short time later, the Kokuka Courageous, loaded with methanol from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, also called for help.\n\nThe U.S. Navy sent a destroyer, the USS Bainbridge, to assist, said Cmdr. Joshua Frey, a 5th Fleet spokesman. He described the ships as being hit in a \"reported attack,\" without elaborating. Tensions have escalated in the Mideast as Iran appears poised to break the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, an accord that President Donald Trump repudiated last year. In the deal, Tehran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of crippling sanctions. Now, Iran is threatening to resume enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels if European nations don't offer it new terms to the deal by July 7. Already, Iran says it has quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions have cut off opportunities for Iran to trade its excess uranium and heavy water abroad, putting Tehran on course to violate terms of the nuclear deal regardless.",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Reiterate Opposing Positions on Taxes Ahead of Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of signals suggesting compromise, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner restated their contrasting positions on taxes over the weekend. The president advocated for higher taxes on the wealthy, while Boehner called for tax code reform and lower overall tax rates.\n\nPresident Obama, who has invited Mr. Boehner and other congressional leaders to the White House next week to discuss ways to avoid the \"fiscal cliff,\" a series of automatic spending cuts and tax hikes set to take effect at the end of the year, emphasized that part of the solution will involve increased taxes for individuals earning more than $250,000.\n\n\"If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue \u2013 and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes,\" the president said in his weekly Internet and radio address. \"That's how we did it when Bill Clinton was president. And that's the only way we can afford to invest in education and job training and manufacturing \u2013 all the ingredients of a strong middle class and a strong economy.\"\n\nThe president reaffirmed his belief, expressed a day earlier, that the results of Tuesday's election, which saw the re-election of the Democratic incumbent and the addition of more Democrats to the Senate and the House, constituted a mandate for \"action.\"\n\n\"On Tuesday, America went to the polls. And the message you sent was clear: You voted for action, not politics as usual,\" he said. \"That's why I've invited leaders of both parties to the White House next week, so we can start to build consensus around challenges we can only solve together.\"\n\n\"This is even more important because at the end of this year, we face a series of deadlines that require us to make major decisions about how to pay down our deficit \u2013 decisions that will have a huge impact on the economy and the middle class, now and in the future,\" he said.\n\nPart of the \"fiscal cliff\" facing the U.S. economy involves the scheduled expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would result in a broad-based tax hike in 2013. The president urged Republicans to take action to prevent this scenario.\n\n\"We need a majority in Congress to listen \u2013 and they should start by making sure taxes don't go up on the 98 percent of Americans making under $250,000 a year starting January 1. This is something we all agree on,\" the president said.\n\nMr. Boehner has stated that tax increases would send the fragile American economy into a double-dip recession.\n\n\"Instead of raising tax rates on the American people and accepting the damage it will do to our economy, let's start to actually solve the problem. Let's focus on tax reform that closes special interest loopholes and lowers tax rates,\" the Ohio Republican said in the GOP's weekly address.\n\n\"If there was a mandate in this election, it was a mandate to work together to do what's in the best interest of our country,\" the Republican leader said. \"And right now, what's best is getting our economy moving again and keeping it moving, so we can begin to restore our children's future.\"\n\nMr. Boehner and Republicans support extending the Bush tax cuts. The White House supports the extension for income under $250,000, but seeks higher rates for income above that level.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Drops Defamation Lawsuit Against Hillary Clinton\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has withdrawn her defamation lawsuit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to Reuters. Gabbard filed the lawsuit in federal court in January, seeking at least $50 million for remarks Clinton made that suggested Gabbard was a \"favorite\" of Moscow and was being \"groomed\" by the Kremlin, and reportedly implied that she is a \"Russian asset.\"\n\nGabbard and her campaign filed a notice of dismissal, stating they \"remain certain of the action's legal merit\" but they wanted to focus on the current coronavirus pandemic and \"defeating Donald Trump in 2020, rather than righting the wrongs here.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that Clinton \"carelessly and recklessly impugned\" Gabbard's reputation during an October podcast interview. The interview in question was one Clinton gave on the \"Campaign HQ\" podcast with host David Plouffe. During it, Clinton indicated that Moscow was \"grooming\" Gabbard for a spoiler campaign.\n\nClinton reportedly said, \"They're also going to do third-party again. I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on someone who's currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians.\"\n\nWhen asked if she was referring to Gabbard, Clinton responded, \"If the nesting doll fits.\" Clinton added that the attempt to get a Democrat to run third party would happen only if the Russians did not use 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein to accomplish the same thing.\n\n\"And that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she's also a Russian asset,\" Clinton said. \"Yeah, she's a Russian asset\u2014I mean, totally.\"",
    " Title: Planned Parenthood Under Investigation, Criticized for Double Billing Medicaid and Obamacare Navigation Services\n\nArticle:\n\nThe nation's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, is currently under investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for double billing Medicaid. Additionally, the organization is receiving over $650,000 as official \"Obamacare Navigators\" to encourage individuals to sign up for Obamacare, a program they stand to benefit significantly from.\n\nThis revelation has sparked controversy, with some accusing Planned Parenthood of relying on a vicious cycle of questionable decisions. Students for Life of America is taking their Planned Parenthood Project to over 40 schools in 20 states, aiming to expose the organization's practices.\n\nThe most surprising finding on campuses so far has been the gratitude expressed by pro-choice students for the truth being unveiled. The crux of the issue lies in Planned Parenthood's use of taxpayer dollars to lobby for and, in some school districts, teach comprehensive sex education, which promotes promiscuity, carcinogenic contraception use, and normalizes inappropriate relationships and abortion.\n\nContraception methods offered by Planned Parenthood to sexually active teens and young adults have been found to be of low quality. Consumer Reports has rated Planned Parenthood condoms as the lowest quality, meaning they will fail more times to prevent pregnancy than other condoms. Furthermore, the hormonal contraception they promote has been labeled by the World Health Organization as a Type 1 Carcinogen, a category that includes cigarettes and asbestos, indicating it causes cancer.\n\nWith young people becoming sexually active, in part due to Planned Parenthood's efforts, and using defective and cancer-causing contraception, they often turn to Planned Parenthood when they contract a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Subsequently, when they become pregnant, they return to Planned Parenthood for abortion services.\n\nPlanned Parenthood performs an average of 915 abortions per day, making abortion 92% of their pregnancy services. These abortions generated revenue of $150 million last year alone. Options counseling is reportedly scarce, with former Planned Parenthood employees admitting that their \"options counseling\" is primarily about encouraging women to have abortions to meet mandated abortion quotas.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's primary focus, critics argue, is abortion. With the organization receiving over $542 million in taxpayer funds annually and boasting a profit exceeding $100 million, it is not surprising that they would seize the opportunity to push Obamacare on women in need. The more women enrolled in Obamacare, the more women they can charge the government and taxpayers for servicing.",
    " Title: Young Republicans Call for Break from Intellectually Suffocating Conservative Media Bubble\n\nArticle:\n\nA generational divide within the Republican Party is escalating after last week's election results, with younger operatives and ideologues advocating for the party to break free from a self-reinforcing media bubble that they deem intellectually stifling and self-defeating.\n\nGOP officials have attributed their electoral losses to various factors, including shifting demographics, a poorly timed hurricane, and inadequate voter turnout systems. However, a group of Republicans under 50 believes the party's problem is more fundamental.\n\nThis media bubble, they argue, is not geographically confined but rather a self-selected media universe that reinforces their views and reflects an alternate reality. The term \"Pauline Kaelism\" has been invoked, referring to a famous quote by Pauline Kael, a New Yorker film critic who, in the aftermath of Richard M. Nixon's 1972 landslide, stated that she knew only one person who voted for Nixon.\n\nYoung Republicans express concern that they are the ones in this hermetically sealed bubble. Rasmussen polls are considered gospel, the Benghazi controversy is equated with Watergate, and Fox News, talk radio, and the Drudge Report are seen as political oracles.\n\nEven after a convincing Obama win, some far-right conservatives continue to believe in mass voter fraud and the disappearance of military ballots. This denial and refusal to confront reality have been likened to a political version of \"Thelma and Louise,\" with some conservatives preferring to drive off a cliff rather than face a reality they'd rather not acknowledge.\n\nTechnology has further solidified this conservative media bubble, with Facebook, Twitter feeds, and email inboxes replacing the old newspaper front page. Consumers now have the power to choose what they see each day and can largely shut out dissenting voices.\n\nTrey Grayson, the former Kentucky secretary of state and the current head of Harvard's Institute of Politics, noted, \"The Internet amplifies talk radio and cable news, and provides distribution for other sources like Newsmax. Then your friends, who usually agree with you, disseminate the same stories on Facebook and Twitter. And you assume that everyone agrees with you!\"\n\nGrayson further explained, \"It's very striking for me living in Cambridge now. My Facebook feed, which is full of mostly conservatives from Kentucky, contains very different links to articles or topics than what I see in Cambridge. It is sort of the reverse up here. They don't understand how anyone would eat Chick-fil-A, watch college sports, or hold pro-life views.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Airlifts $400 Million in Cash to Iran in January, Coinciding with Release of American Prisoners\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration secretly airlifted $400 million in cash to Iran in January, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The money was the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the administration reached with Iran to resolve a 37-year-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979.\n\nThe cash was flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, with wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs, and other currency. The money was not disclosed by President Obama when he referred to the resolution of the arms dispute in January, stating, \"with the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well.\"\n\nThe timing of the cash transfer and the release of the American prisoners has led to criticism and accusations of a ransom payment. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest denied the payment was a ransom for the release of the prisoners, stating that such a move would violate U.S. policy.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, over the report. \"Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe four prisoners included two Iranian-Americans arrested by Iranian security services during Obama's first term, the detention of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, in 2014 on espionage charges, and the arrest in 2015 of a fourth Iranian-American.\n\nThe newspaper reported that U.S. and European officials would not disclose exactly when the cash-laden plane landed in Tehran, but a report by the Iranian Tasnim news agency, with close ties to the Revolutionary Guard, said it arrived at Mehrabad airport on the same day the Americans left the country.\n\nIn Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest defended the deal by stating, \"first of all, it's Iranian money\" and noting that the money had been paid into a U.S. account in 1979 as part of a deal to buy military equipment that never took place because of the overthrow of the shah. As for why cash was used in the transaction, Earnest said, \"the fact of the matter is that the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a banking relationship with Iran\" due to continued concerns about Tehran's \"nefarious\" behavior in such areas as terrorism and human rights.\n\nEarnest also acknowledged that \"it\u2019s possible that some of the money\" has been used by Iran to support Hezbollah and the regime of President Bashar Assad in Syria.",

The vice presidential debates typically do not have a significant impact on the election's outcome, but this year could be different due to the increased stakes.\n\nBiden, who does not have the burden of projecting a presidential demeanor, has the opportunity to be more aggressive in his approach against Ryan, a budget expert 27 years his junior. However, veering off script and appearing angry could backfire, reminding viewers of Sen. John McCain's grumpy performance in the 2008 debate against Biden.\n\nTo prepare for the prime-time clash at Centre College in Danville, Ky., Biden has spent much of the week in a hotel in Wilmington, Del., scrutinizing videos of Ryan's speeches and interviews, and holding mock debates with Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and David Axelrod, a senior adviser in the Obama campaign.\n\nBiden's frequent gaffes on the campaign trail have provided ample material for Republicans, but the vice president has been focused on keeping his tongue in check during the debate. \"I don't want to say anything in the debate that's not completely accurate,\" he told reporters last week.\n\nBiden, a seasoned debate veteran who has run for president twice and delivered a strong performance against then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008, faces a relatively untested opponent in Ryan. Ryan, who has only participated in a debate once, during his first run for Congress 14 years ago, has spent the past week in debate preparation at a resort in the Blue Ridge Mountains, 150 miles southwest of Washington. Former Solicitor General Ted Olson played the role of Biden in the mock debates.\n\nFour years ago, Biden approached the debate against Palin cautiously, careful not to get too rough with the newcomer to the national stage. However, after Obama's lethargic showing last week, Biden is expected to come out swinging.\n\n\"I expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball,\" Ryan told reporters earlier this week. \"He'll be in full attack mode, and I don't think he'll let any inconvenient facts get in his way.\"\n\nDuring the debate, Biden is likely to focus on forcing Ryan to defend Romney's proposals on taxes and spending and seizing any opportunity to tie Romney to Ryan's Medicare plan, which includes caps on future spending and a plan to partially privatize it.\n\nIn a recent CNN poll, Obama led Romney-Ryan on Medicare, 53 percent to 44 percent. In early September, while campaigning in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin, Biden said the Romney-Ryan ticket would turn Medicare into \"voucher-care.\" However, Ryan has not tried to run away from the Medicare issue, memorably joining his 78-year-old mother, Betty Douglas, when he delivered a speech on Medicare reform in The Villages, Fla., a large retirement community in mid-September.\n\nDuring the address, Ryan accused Obama of siphoning off hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to pay for his 2010 health care overhaul. \"Medicare should not be a piggy bank for Obamacare,\" he said, reassuring seniors that he is committed to protecting the Medicare guarantee for current seniors and for generations to come.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the debate will unfold, but both candidates have been preparing diligently for the high-stakes showdown.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucuses Result in Tie for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders finished in a tie, with each candidate receiving approximately 27% of the votes. This marks the second time in eight years that Clinton has underperformed in the state, following her third-place finish in the 2008 caucuses.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses, often criticized for their unpredictable and idiosyncratic nature, have once again proven to be a challenging terrain for Clinton. In 2008, her third-place finish was a harbinger of her eventual loss to then-Senator Barack Obama. This year, Sanders, who was virtually unknown to most of the country a year ago, managed to fight Clinton to a standstill, erasing any remaining traces of inevitability surrounding her campaign.\n\nFor Sanders, the results in Iowa cap a remarkable year. He has enlisted a groundswell of grassroots support and thoroughly defined the contours of the primary race. This was evident in his speech, which was entirely focused on domestic issues, mirroring the themes Sanders has embraced. In contrast, Clinton's speech made no mention of foreign policy, specifically ISIS.\n\nThe race now moves to New Hampshire, where Sanders currently holds a commanding lead. After that, the campaign heads to Nevada and South Carolina, where Clinton is way up in the polls. However, polls can change, and it seems more likely than not that Sanders will ultimately be overwhelmed by Clinton. The duration of the race, however, is expected to be longer than initially anticipated.\n\nThe reasons for Clinton's current predicament are the subject of much analysis. It is suggested that to truly understand the situation, one must look beyond the narrow confines of party politics. Sanders' success can be attributed to the influence of various social movements, such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, women's rights activists, climate change activists, immigrants' rights activists, and LGBT activists. These movements have pushed the boundaries, forced the scope of discourse to open up, and trickled down into the political process. There were people waiting for Bernie Sanders, and the best idea he ever had was to show up.",
    " Title: Study Finds No Differences in Science Trust Between Liberals and Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nA study titled \"The Partisan Brain: How Dissonant Science Messages Lead Conservatives and Liberals to (Dis) Trust Science,\" to be published in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science next month, suggests that both liberals and conservatives exhibit similar levels of distrust in science when it contradicts their political beliefs.\n\nThe research, conducted by Erik Nesbit, R. Kelly Garrett, and Kathryn Cooper from Ohio State University, examined audience reactions to both conservative-dissonant and liberal-dissonant science messages and their impact on trust in the scientific community. The study involved 1,518 adults, who were divided into three groups.\n\nOne group, identified as conservatives, was asked questions about scientific research on climate change and evolution that contradicted their political leanings. The second group, labeled as liberals, were asked similar questions on fracking and nuclear power that went against standard liberal political beliefs. The third group was asked more politically neutral questions.\n\nAccording to the study, both liberals and conservatives were less likely to trust the scientific results in the groups where those results were out of sync with their own ideology. The Christian Post reported these findings, stating, \"Both liberals and conservatives were less likely to trust the scientific results in the groups where those results were out of sync with their own ideology.\"\n\nThe Christian Post also noted that while conservatives have often been considered less likely, especially by liberals, to accept findings of science that run counter to their political prejudices, the study challenges previous research reporting that the brains of conservatives are fundamentally different and less capable of rationally processing scientific evidence.\n\nThe researchers state, \"There has been deepening concern about political polarization in public attitudes toward the scientific community. The 'intrinsic thesis' attributes this polarization to psychological deficiencies among conservatives as compared to liberals.\" However, the study's findings \"link to the larger debate about political polarization of science and implications for science communicators.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Gun Control Options: Policy Proposals and Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's call for action following the Newtown massacre has sparked hope among anti-gun advocates, despite the president's avoidance of specific details. The White House has maintained this tactic, with Obama discussing the shootings with Vice President Joe Biden and several Cabinet secretaries, but providing no specific agenda.\n\nSenators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who both have high National Rifle Association ratings, have expressed openness to new gun restrictions. One of the top policy proposals circulating is an updated assault weapons ban, which Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is reportedly working on and plans to introduce in the new Senate session. Feinstein hopes to gain Obama's support, stating, \"I'd like to talk to him about his help in moving forward with this.\"\n\nSpeaker John Boehner has expressed sympathy for the Newtown victims but has not mentioned any legislative action. His spokesman provided no additional comment on proposed gun laws. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a supporter of an assault weapons ban, is skeptical about significant changes. \"I hope I'm wrong, but I'm just being realistic,\" King said. \"Maybe this is the incident that is going to drive common-sense regulation forward, but we've seen so much in recent years and none of them have done anything.\"\n\nObama himself acknowledged that individual government actions may be limited in preventing future gun attacks. \"No single law, no set of laws, can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society,\" he said. However, he will need legislation to achieve any major action on the issue.\n\nDan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, stated that his organization is in regular contact with the White House and is encouraged by Obama's message. Gross believes that significant progress will require policy, and he does not believe Obama can make sufficient progress without Congress. \"We're not at the point where we're talking about executive action,\" Gross said. \"It's almost kind of limiting to think that way. I think this is a moment to do what's we've needed on this issue for a long time.\"",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Divide on Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants Among Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by CNN has revealed a significant divide among Americans regarding the provision of government-backed healthcare to illegal immigrants. The poll, released on Monday, found that 58% of Americans oppose giving healthcare to illegal immigrants, while 38% support the idea.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,001 adults, also showed that all ten Democratic candidates who participated in the second night of the debate raised their hands in support of providing healthcare to illegal immigrants when asked during the debate. The debate included Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThe poll results are in line with a previous poll by NBC, which found that ten out of ten candidates raised their hands in support of covering illegal immigrants in their healthcare plans during a debate last Thursday.\n\nThe poll also revealed that Americans are skeptical of the idea of completely replacing private health insurance with a national program. Only 21% of voters support this idea, with most of those in favor of a single-payer system also wanting to allow private coverage to coexist.\n\nThe poll results come as the Democratic candidates continue to debate the merits of various healthcare proposals, with some, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, advocating for a single-payer system that would eliminate private insurance coverage for the majority of Americans. Other candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg and Kirsten Gillibrand, have also expressed support for a single-payer system, but have stated that it would not necessarily drive private insurance out of business.\n\nThe poll also found that a large majority of Americans oppose bills that would make private coverage illegal, with only about one-in-five voters in favor of such proposals. This would cancel and eliminate the plans of roughly 180 million Americans. Even among Democratic voters, a large majority oppose such a proposal.\n\nThe poll results come as the Democratic candidates continue to debate the merits of various healthcare proposals, with some advocating for a single-payer system and others advocating for a more moderate approach that allows for the coexistence of private and government-backed healthcare. The poll also revealed a significant divide among Americans on the issue of providing healthcare to illegal immigrants.",
    " Title: Obama Calls for Replacement of Budget Cuts, Renewing Spending Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Tuesday called for replacing the automatic spending cuts, known as sequesters, with a combination of smaller cuts and tax increases. This renews the debate over spending that has dominated Washington for the past two years, but seemed to cool after the January deal that raised taxes across the board.\n\nThe president proposed another round of tax reform targeting the wealthy, cutting deductions and loopholes. However, he emphasized that at the very least, Congress should avert the sequester, which he described as an \"avoidable self-inflicted economic wound.\"\n\nRepublican leaders were quick to reject the president's offer. House Speaker John A. Boehner issued a statement saying it was the president who came up with the sequester idea. He also stated that House Republicans have passed two bills to avert the sequesters, so Mr. Obama must lay out his own specific plan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell rebuked Mr. Obama for lecturing Congress about the need to avoid the cuts he proposed. He suggested that if Democrats have ideas for smarter cuts, they should bring them up for debate. McConnell also criticized Mr. Obama for failing to submit a budget by the statutory deadline this year.\n\nThe White House first came up with the idea of the arbitrary, across-the-board spending cuts during budget talks in summer 2011 as a way to pressure Democrats and Republicans in Congress into coming up with their own spending cut plan to reduce the deficit over the next decade. However, partisan gridlock quickly took hold, and a supercommittee of lawmakers tasked with coming up with a plan to find alternative spending cuts to replace the sequester failed to reach a deal after negotiating for months.\n\nThe Pentagon has grown increasingly pessimistic about the chances of avoiding the cuts, and the branches of the military have issued memos outlining what programs and sections would be hit hardest. Washington think tanks and policy centers have warned repeatedly of the havoc that the cuts could wreak on the economy. The Bipartisan Policy Center has estimated that 1 million jobs could be lost this year and next as a direct result of the spending cuts, and defense industry analysts say that number could rise to 2 million this year alone.\n\nThe president made his plea as Senate Democrats were meeting in Annapolis for their annual retreat. Mr. Obama is scheduled to address the group Wednesday.",

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has criticized government spending, citing examples of what he considers wasteful expenditures, during an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis on AM 970 in New York. In the interview, Paul pointed out a $700,000 study on Neil Armstrong's quote upon landing on the moon as an example of unnecessary spending.\n\nPaul also expressed his desire for the Pentagon's budget to be audited before any additional funds are allocated. He stated, \"Before we give them more money, make them account for the money they're already spending.\"\n\nSen. Paul, known as one of the Senate's most ardent budget hawks, has previously criticized both his own party and the Republican administration of President Donald Trump for high spending levels.\n\nOn Friday, Sen. Paul forced a brief government shutdown by delaying a vote on a sweeping spending bill with a lengthy speech on the Senate floor. The bill, which included increases in both domestic and military spending, eventually passed hours later and was signed by President Trump, ending the shutdown.",
    " Title: Normalcy and Alarm: An Analysis of the Reactions to Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn nominating conservative appellate court judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, President Trump has followed a common practice. However, the response from liberal critics has been anything but normal, with some comparing the nomination to the imminent end of democracy and the establishment of an American dictatorship.\n\nThe nomination of Kavanaugh, a consummate conservative who might have been nominated by previous Republican presidents, was met with severe reactions from Hollywood, New York, and Washington. Tweets from Eric Holthaus, Joss Whedon, and Rob Reiner, among others, expressed concerns about the fate of democracy, the planet, and the president's potential obstruction of justice and conspiring with an enemy.\n\nWhile such reactions are not without justification, the focus has been on the supposed extremism of Kavanaugh's legal and constitutional views rather than the injustice of Mitch McConnell's refusal to allow hearings or a vote on Barack Obama's nominee to succeed Antonin Scalia. This has led to concerns about the mainstream Democratic position considering not just President Trump's most egregious statements, behavior, and policies as a threat to liberal democracy in America, but also longstanding, mainstream Republican positions.\n\nThe issue at hand is the problem of crying wolf. Democrats have a history of amping up the insults about Republican presidents and would-be presidents. Now, with a president who displays affinity for fascism and pursues policies rooted in racism, Democrats are left in the position of saying, \"But this time we're serious!\" Their case will not be strengthened by demonizing a conventional conservative jurist like Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe second and far more ominous danger is whether or not the dire assessment of the peril posed by supposedly normal Republican ideas and goals is valid. If it is, it means that one of the country's two parties poses a significant threat to the form of government, akin to a cancer that threatens the human body from the inside. On this view, Republicans are less a legitimate rival for power than a civic menace, a formidable enemy that needs to be decisively defeated.\n\nIf Republicans truly pose such a threat, that's very bad. But it's also bad if Democrats merely think and act as if it's true, since it implies that they now believe that the only way to be a \"good American\" is to\u2026 be a Democrat. The problem with Kavanaugh, after all, is not Trump's corruption or the gratuitous cruelty and ineptitude of his administration. The problem with Kavanaugh is the agenda of his party and its ideology going back decades.\n\nDo Democrats really intend to suggest that Americans need to agree with them or else risk subverting American democracy as such? If so, they should be clear about it\u2014and honest with themselves about what it implies, which is that what was formerly considered perfectly normal (the ordinary give-and-take of democratic politics) has now become a luxury the country can no longer afford. That would signal the end of normal politics in America\u2014and constitute a genuine crisis of American democracy. I have a hard time imagining anything more alarming than that.",
    " Title: Florida's Voting Landscape Shifts as 1.4 Million Felons Regain Voting Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe state of Florida has experienced a significant shift in its voting landscape following the approval of Amendment 4, a ballot initiative that grants voting rights to approximately 1.4 million convicted felons who have completed their sentences. The measure excludes those convicted of murder and sex crimes.\n\nThe amendment, supported by nearly two-thirds of Floridians in Tuesday's vote, expands the pool of eligible voters in Florida by a substantial margin, potentially influencing future elections, given that elections in the state are often decided by fewer than 100,000 votes. The exact political party that stands to benefit the most from this new pool of eligible voters remains uncertain, according to multiple experts and activists. It is also unclear how many felons will actually register to vote.\n\nDemocratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections overwhelmingly endorsed Amendment 4, making it a key part of their campaigns. Republicans, including Sen. Rick Scott, largely opposed it.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson narrowly lost his race against Rick Scott, and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) fell short against former Rep. Ron DeSantis by less than 33,000 votes.\n\nThe implementation of the restored rights remains uncertain. Gov. DeSantis stated earlier this week that an implementing bill may be necessary for the Legislature to provide clarity on the process.\n\n\"There's going to need to be guidance for that,\" DeSantis told reporters. \"It's not delaying it. The people spoke on it. It's going to be implemented, but I think it needs to be implemented the way people intended, and I don't think that they wanted to see any sex offenders fall through the cracks.\"",

The latest polls indicate that Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton are the frontrunners, but the other candidates are engaged in intense battles for second place.\n\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, Trump currently enjoys a significant lead with 36% support, compared to approximately 20% for his closest competitor, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas. Trump aims to capitalize on his New Hampshire win, stating, \"If we win here after winning so big in New Hampshire, we will make America great again \u2013 that I can tell you.\"\n\nTrump's New Hampshire victory was broad-based, capturing voters across demographic categories, including men and women, city and countryside dwellers, and both conservative and moderate voters. He also won support from voters of all ages.\n\nCruz positions himself as the main challenger to Trump, stating, \"One of the most important conclusions coming out of these first two states is that the candidate who can beat Donald Trump is me.\"\n\nSenator Marco Rubio from Florida and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush currently hold third and fourth place, respectively. As of Wednesday, two Republican candidates, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, have dropped out of the race following weak showings in New Hampshire.\n\nIn the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders outperformed Clinton in New Hampshire, but she currently leads him in South Carolina, with 62% compared to his 32%. Clinton has acknowledged the need to engage with young voters, particularly women, as Sanders captured more than 80% of women voters under 30 in New Hampshire. Clinton is now reaching out to this demographic, stating, \"You may not support me, but I support you.\"\n\nSanders is also challenging Clinton with an impressive fundraising machine and has invested heavily in Nevada, which holds its Democratic caucus on February 20. Sanders is targeting the minority vote, but Clinton is also actively courting this demographic. This week, the Congressional Black Caucus PAC endorsed Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner.\n\nIf the polls are accurate, Clinton and Trump should easily win in South Carolina. However, the other candidates are working hard to close the gap, as more than 20 states will cast their votes in March.",
    " Title: Sanders Regains Momentum in Democratic Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, Senator Bernie Sanders, who had a heart attack two months ago and trailed Senator Elizabeth Warren in the polls, is now gaining ground on former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders addressed a large crowd at a beachside rally in Los Angeles last Saturday, emphasizing his campaign's focus on a \"political revolution\" and transforming the country to benefit all people, not just the 1%.\n\nTwo months ago, Sanders' heart attack and Warren's surge in the polls made a strong showing in the Democratic primary seem unlikely. However, Warren has since slipped back, and Sanders has regained lost ground, demonstrating the resilience of his left-wing campaign. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Warren was 12 points ahead of Sanders in early October, but Sanders has since pulled ahead of her. The polling average now shows Sanders in second place, averaging 19.3% in national polls, eight points behind Biden and four points ahead of Warren.\n\nDan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, told Politico that Sanders has a \"very good shot\" of winning Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, and could build a \"real head of steam\" heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday. Sanders' campaign seems to be learning from the pitfalls of his 2016 campaign, particularly in reaching out to voters of color, specifically Latinos. Polls show Sanders is the top choice among Latino voters, and he held a Spanish-language town hall on Sunday in Las Vegas, Nevada, alongside Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nSanders' greatest asset, a core of solid support, is also shared by Biden. The Democratic primary has proven surprisingly stable so far, with Biden continuing to lead despite negative coverage in recent months. Like Sanders, Biden has a solid base of supporters who have not abandoned him. However, Sanders would need the dynamics of the primary to shift in some significant way to pull ahead of Biden.\n\nMany centrist Democrats remain unconvinced Sanders can form a winning Democratic coalition. Matt Bennett, the co-founder of the center-left thinktank Third Way, told Politico that Sanders \"can't win the nomination.\" Bennett and some of Sanders' other critics have argued the senator's ceiling of support is too low to ultimately defeat his primary opponents.\n\nHowever, Sanders' 2016 campaign proved that he thrives on low expectations. Many Washington insiders scoffed at Sanders' first White House bid until he fought Clinton to a draw in Iowa and scored a decisive victory in New Hampshire. Today, Sanders is offering the same message: \"Don't underestimate me.\"",

Among senior staff, 36 percent are people of color, according to the campaign. By comparison, 25 percent of President Trump's campaign's senior staff are people of color, the campaign told the same media outlet. The Trump campaign did not release information regarding the percentage of people of color on its full-time staff.\n\nBoth campaigns also said a small majority of their full-time and senior staff are women. The Biden campaign said that 53 percent of full-time staff and 58 percent of senior staff identify as female. According to the Trump campaign, 52 percent of full-time staff are women and 56 percent of senior staff are women.\n\nSenior staff includes department heads, senior advisors, deputy campaign managers, and senior consultants who spend the majority of their time on the campaign, according to the Biden campaign.\n\nBiden's campaign said it is still continuing the hiring process and expects to add key leaders across the campaign. The campaign released the data after Biden was pressed about the information during a town hall focusing on issues affecting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, according to CNN.\n\n\"We'll release the diversity data today when we get off this call. We'll call you, and the fact of the matter is we have a very diverse staff. And we have a diverse staff that goes across the board,\" Biden reportedly said during the town hall.",
    " Title: Trump's Position on Deportation of Undocumented Immigrants Remains Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The position of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump regarding the forced deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States remains undecided, according to his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump stated, \"I'm not flip-flopping.\" He emphasized the need for a \"fair but firm\" process, without providing specifics or elaborating on his position.\n\nDuring a roundtable discussion with a Hispanic advisory council on Saturday, reports suggest that Trump spoke about a \"humane and efficient\" way to work with undocumented immigrants currently residing in the country, which was characterized by BuzzFeed as a potential way to legalize some and allow them to stay. This stance would contrast with the hardline position on immigration that has been a central theme of the Trump campaign since the beginning, focusing on removing people in the country illegally.\n\nConway disputed that Trump presented a reversal of his position in the meeting. She stated, \"What Donald Trump said yesterday in that meeting... varied little from what he has said publicly.\" According to Conway, Trump's goal is to ensure the enforcement of the law, respect for American job seekers, and fair and humane treatment for those living among us.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's stance on deportation during CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Conway responded, \"To be determined.\" In response to a clip of Trump speaking about a deportation force last fall, Conway was repeatedly asked if this was still the position of the campaign or whether Trump was backing off. Early Sunday evening, the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton released a statement scoffing at Trump's potential change of heart on deportation.\n\nJose Fuentes, a Trump supporter and the former attorney general of Puerto Rico, was at the roundtable with Trump on Saturday and stated that he did not interpret Trump as being open to legalization for some undocumented immigrants. Fuentes said that Trump brought up the issue of those in the US illegally and asked the group to share their ideas on how to deal with them. Fuentes said that Trump used the language of wanting to handle the issue in a \"fair,\" \"humane,\" and \"legal\" way, but Fuentes did not automatically take that to mean that Trump was going to allow some to stay or have legal status.\n\nBeyond immigration, Conway reiterated the long-standing Trump campaign position that the candidate will not release his tax returns, stating they are under audit. She also addressed a 2005 comment she made about Clinton and whether she was disparaging spouses who reconcile after cheating. Conway stated that she was not making a statement about Clinton's marriage and that the question is about Clinton's leadership and her ability to stand up to enemies in the world.\n\nConway also stated that former Fox News chief Roger Ailes does not have a \"formal or informal\" advisory role with the campaign, but said Ailes and Trump speak and are \"old friends.\" Conway, on \"This Week,\" also answered questions about the campaign's organization, addressing ongoing criticism about the campaign's structure and seeming lack of infrastructure in swing states. As Trump's new campaign manager, Conway stated she would assess the situation, adding that the Republican National Committee would be continuing to help.\n\nConway did not say Sean Spicer, the director of communications and the chief strategist at the RNC, was formally joining the campaign. She also addressed Trump's statement last week - for the first time - that he has \"regrets\" over certain, but unspecified, statements throughout his campaign. Conway was pressed on whether Trump was specifically apologizing for high-profile controversial statements, including disparaging Arizona Sen. John McCain's military record and comments he made about a Gold Star family that spoke at the Democratic convention. Conway demurred on who specifically Trump was expressing regret to, and said he has not made apology calls to individuals.",
    " Title: Tea Party Members Accuse Federal Government of Political Misconduct Following IRS Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington (CNN) - Following the scrutiny of some of their political groups by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), members of the tea party have expressed renewed concerns about government overreach and big government.\n\nAt a rally on Capitol Hill Thursday, Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN) suggested that the IRS's actions, which led to the resignation of the acting commissioner of the agency, could indicate a broader pattern of political misconduct within the federal government. She specifically pointed to the President's health care law as a measure with potential for political manipulation.\n\n\"Knowing it's the IRS who will be the enforcing mechanism for this new entitlement program of Obamacare, it is very important to ask \u2013 and now it is reasonable to ask \u2013 could there be potential political implications of access to healthcare, denial of healthcare? Will that happen based upon a person's political beliefs, or their religiously held beliefs?\" Bachmann asked at the rally, which was attended by senators and representatives who were elected to office with support from tea party groups.\n\nTea party groups have long been critical of the President's health care law and Republicans in Congress will vote for the thirty-seventh time to repeal the measure on Thursday. The groups have also been skeptical of government overreach into the personal lives of citizens, a concern that lawmakers at Thursday's rally linked to the Justice Department's seizure of phone records from reporters and editors at the Associated Press.\n\nThese revelations coincided with renewed interest in September's attack at an American diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya \u2013 a topic that has been a rallying cry for tea party members who use it to claim incompetence and deception from the Obama administration's national security team.\n\nCombined, the events of the last several days appeared to confirm in the minds of tea party Republicans their longstanding belief that the government is working against them.\n\n\"The three events of the last few days \u2013 the IRS, the AP, and Benghazi \u2013 tend to confirm our worst fears about our government,\" Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said at Thursday's rally. \"They tend to tell us what we do not want to believe, but what sometimes turns out to be true. That your government is targeting you. That your government is spying on you. And that your government is lying to you.\"\n\nAt least one lawmaker, Bachmann, even floated the notion of impeachment during the event, saying what happened at the IRS was a scandal worse than Watergate, the criminal incident that brought down President Richard Nixon.\n\nObama's response to the situation \u2013 including demanding the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller \u2013 has only scratched the surface, said Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\n\"Someone needs to be held responsible. Someone needs to be imprisoned. Someone needs to be prosecuted,\" said Paul, who won election with tea party support in 2010 and has said he's eyeing a run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. \"The resignation is a step in the right direction, but we need to find out who wrote this policy, who approved this policy, and they need to be held accountable.\"\n\nBachmann, citing reports that Miller had planned to step down in June anyway, described the resignation as a \"canard\" meant to allay citizens' fears without truly addressing the problem.\n\n\"Yesterday the president engaged in damage control 101,\" she said. \"He wanted to stop the story because the president's had a no good, very bad week this last week.\"",

The proposed war, which a majority of Americans don't want and for which the administration still can't clearly justify, has been met with skepticism and doubts.\n\nThe American people, weary after over a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, are not eager to commit to another questionable intervention. The war, which Mr. Kerry himself refuses to call a war, has been described as a potential new war by the American people.\n\nThe Washington Examiner's Tim Carney writes, \"Some members of Congress say they'll support a limited strike on Syria. But this is a fantasy. It relies on limiting two things that naturally defy limit: war and presidential power.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Mr. Kerry, along with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, failed to demonstrate any clear national security connection the United States has in Syria. The supposed justification for intervention to stop the use of chemical weapons still does not tell us how military action would actually deter their use. We're still not absolutely sure about the origins of their use.\n\nWhat we can be fairly sure of is that we will be helping rebel groups in Syria who are affiliated with al Qaeda. President Obama might not be able to articulate a national interest, but any American with memory can recognize a potential powder-keg component of this situation that should make us at least wary of helping the rebels. President George W. Bush promised in 2001, \"We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.\" Are we now on the eve of giving military shelter to the same people who attacked us on Sept. 11?\n\nThis is the elephant in the room that Mr. Kerry and nearly every other politician in support of war with Syria refuse to talk about. They can laugh or scoff all they want, and they can act as though the rebel group al-Nusra won't benefit from our efforts, but the enemy of our enemy is not our friend\u2014and he is still our enemy.\n\nNeither Mr. Kerry nor anyone else in this administration has been able to answer adequately the question of what good might come out of this war for the United States. There are too many troubling variables and dangerous unknowns. Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees.",
    " Title: Deloitte Report Highlights Potential Costs of U.S. National Debt Over the Next Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report issued by Deloitte, one of the world's largest accounting firms, has highlighted the potential costs associated with the U.S. government's nearly $16 trillion debt. The report, which focuses on interest payments, suggests that interest payments on the national debt alone are expected to total some $4.2 trillion over the next decade.\n\nThe lead author of the Deloitte study, director Bill Eggers, emphasized the potential for the U.S. government debt to spiral out of control if investors become less willing to lend more money. If interest rates were to increase by 3 percent over the next decade, the additional cost to the Treasury, just for interest payments, would equal the peak combined cost of the wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nDeloitte, an accounting and consulting firm that often audits government finances, notes that the $4.2 trillion could be used for various purposes, such as:\n\n1. Paying tuition for every science, math, and engineering college degree in the country.\n2. Offsetting 80 percent of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe report also notes that the $4.2 trillion could be given back in the form of tax cuts.\n\nNot all economists agree with the implications of the study. Robert Stonebraker, an economics professor at Winthrop University, stated that a significant portion of the interest payments will go back to Americans. However, Eggers noted that a lot of the interest payments do go overseas.\n\nCurrently, foreigners own some $5 trillion in U.S. government bonds, with $1 trillion owned by China. Eggers stated, \"If you look at the interest payments going to foreign countries, soon we're going to be spending enough to essentially finance the Chinese military.\"\n\nStonebraker expressed skepticism about the need to address the debt crisis in the short term, stating that a lot of the debt will go away automatically if the economy recovers. He argued that a significant part of the spending would go away, and debt growth would slow on its own.\n\nOther analysts argue that the deficit should be brought under control quickly and cite European countries that are cutting budgets as an example. Eggers agrees that debt will eventually need to be dealt with, but disagrees on the timing. He stated, \"The debt is not something that is going to go away the more time that goes by.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose Six-Week Debt Ceiling Increase; Obama, Boehner Meet to Discuss Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations, House Republicans have proposed a six-week increase in the nation's borrowing limit, with the White House indicating that President Obama might sign such a measure to prevent a default. The partial government shutdown, now in its 10th day, has taken a backseat to the debt negotiations.\n\nOn Thursday, President Obama met with Speaker John A. Boehner and other GOP leaders at the White House, following which House Majority Leader Eric Cantor stated that further discussions would take place between the teams. The White House described the meeting as worthwhile but emphasized that no specific decision was made.\n\nThe Republican proposal entails a six-week extension of the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling in exchange for the White House agreeing to discuss a broad range of fiscal issues. However, Senate Democrats remain a stumbling block, with Majority Leader Harry Reid expressing uncertainty about the House GOP's intentions.\n\nThe stock markets surged on Thursday following the mere suggestion of a debt deal by Speaker Boehner, demonstrating the keen interest of business leaders in the negotiations. The administration has stated that the government will exhaust its borrowing capacity on Oct. 17 and may have to rely on cash on hand, potentially leading to missed payments to Social Security recipients and veterans.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew outlined the potential consequences of reaching the debt limit, but did not specify how he would prioritize payments, leaving the exact implications unclear. Lew stated, \"I think prioritization is just default by another name.\"\n\nThe debt negotiations have overshadowed the shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 due to Congress' inability to agree on funding the government for fiscal year 2014. The House passed a bill to restore more Border Patrol operations, while the Senate has yet to hold a floor vote on any of the piecemeal bills. The Senate did, however, clear a bill to ensure families of troops killed in action will receive their $100,000 death benefit promptly.\n\nThe Obama administration has signaled a willingness to reconsider some of its national park closures, suggesting it may allow states to use their own funds to operate certain sites. It remains unclear whether the GOP is still solely focused on a debt deal or whether they would accept adding a shutdown deal into the mix.\n\nThe House Republicans' debt proposal was vague when Speaker Boehner presented it to reporters on Thursday. White House press secretary Jay Carney responded coolly but did not rule out the possibility that Obama might agree to the GOP proposal. Carney stated, \"The president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House,\" adding that the GOP proposal \"seems to be a recognition that default is not an option.\"\n\nHowever, Carney also noted that the president \"strongly prefers\" a Senate bill that would raise the borrowing limit beyond the 2014 elections. \"We'll see what they're able to pass, and consider it then,\" Carney said of the House Republicans' proposal.",
    " Title: Examination of Conservative Policies and Accusations of Racism in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe accusation of racism against individuals or parties on the right by prominent figures on the left, including politicians, cable news hosts, and entertainment figures, is a recurring theme in contemporary American politics.\n\nMSNBC host Chris Matthews stated, \"The age of Jim Crow managed to find a new habitat in the 21st-century Republican Party.\" Comedian Seth Meyers told his late-night audience that Republicans \"traffic in open racism.\" Tennessee state representative London Lamar, a black woman, announced that the entire state of Tennessee is \"racist. Period.\" This statement was made shortly after her election in Tennessee.\n\nThe practice of labeling the right as racist is not a new phenomenon, having been a part of political discourse for decades. Republican Presidents such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his son, George W. Bush, have all been accused of being racists. From the left's perspective, \"racist\" is essentially Donald Trump's middle name.\n\nTo call someone a racist is a serious charge, as a racist is a person who believes that one race is inherently superior or inferior to another. This belief is rooted in skin color, not intelligence, character, or values.\n\nThe question at hand is whether conservative policies are, indeed, racist. If they are, then the left's accusations may be valid. If they're not, then the left's accusations may be unfounded.\n\nOne policy that warrants examination is the longstanding conservative opposition to Affirmative Action. The term \"affirmative action\" was first used by Democratic president John F. Kennedy in 1961. However, Affirmative Action in its modern form was not implemented until 1970, during the administration of a Republican president, Richard Nixon.\n\nThe theory behind Affirmative Action was that, due to historical discrimination, blacks were at a competitive disadvantage compared to other races and ethnicities. To erase this disadvantage, standards that most blacks presumably could not meet had to be lowered.\n\nWhile this policy may have had some utility when it was first implemented, the conservative position is that blacks have repeatedly proven they can compete with anyone without the benefits of lower standards. There are countless examples of black success in every field, at every level. The policy is no longer necessary.\n\nHowever, the conservative argument goes further. Study after study shows that, in the case of college admissions, affirmative action hurts more blacks than it helps. By lowering admissions standards for blacks (and some other minority students), colleges set many of these students up for failure. They get placed in schools for which they are not prepared. High black dropout rates confirm this view.\n\nConservatives believe blacks and other minorities are every bit as capable as whites of succeeding as engineers, surgeons, policemen, businessmen, lawyers, and college students. Lowering standards for blacks is unnecessary, as well as insulting. Yet for this belief, conservatives are called racist.\n\nAnother issue where the contrast between conservatives and those who accuse them of being racist is even more starkly drawn is voter ID. Conservatives argue that America should require every voter to present an ID when voting, similar to European countries' practices to maintain election integrity. Are all these democracies racist? Of course not. Yet the accusers say that conservatives who support voter ID are racist.\n\nThe argument is that requiring voter ID is a ruse to prevent blacks and other minorities from voting since many of them allegedly cannot acquire an ID. This argument is condescending, as obtaining an ID is a common requirement for various activities, such as driving, flying, buying alcohol, or purchasing cold medicines.\n\nOne more example is the push for school choice, which would allow all parents, not just wealthy ones, to decide where their children attend school. Tuition vouchers, charter schools \u2013 these are conservative initiatives. Those on the left fight these reforms at every turn. It's the left that does not trust minority parents to select an appropriate school for their children. Why are those who keep black children in failing schools not the racists?\n\nAt some point, one might start questioning: Who is really obsessed with race? The left or the right? And whose policies really hurt blacks?",
    " Title: Trump and Pence Vow to Continue Campaign Amid Calls for Withdrawal Following Controversial Audio Tape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a defiant move, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence have indicated their intention to continue their campaign until the conclusion of the election next month, despite calls for Trump to withdraw from the race following the emergence of a damaging audio tape.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that there was \"zero chance\" he would drop out over lewd comments he made about women in a 2005 audio tape that surfaced on Friday. Trump stated, \"I never, ever give up. The support I\u2019m getting is unbelievable, because Hillary Clinton is a horribly flawed candidate.\"\n\nLater in the day, a smiling Trump briefly appeared outside his Trump Tower headquarters, high-fiving crowd members chanting \"U-S-A!\" and saying that he \u201cwill never let my supporters down.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, Pence, who has described himself as a \"Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\" told a Rhode Island fundraiser that he was committed to the real estate mogul. Rhode Island GOP Chairman Brandon Bell told WPRI-TV of his meeting with Pence, \"He didn\u2019t address it head on, but he wanted to reassure people, the folks that were here \u2013 and I think he\u2019s going to do this publicly in the next coming days \u2013 that we shouldn\u2019t worry, that they\u2019re still on a path to victory.\"\n\nAmid calls for Pence to replace Trump at the top of the Republican ticket, a senior Trump adviser told Fox News late Saturday that the Indiana governor was \"solid\" behind the nominee. Earlier Saturday, Pence said in a statement that he was \"offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the 11-year-old video. I do not condone his remarks and can not defend them.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, and the party's 2008 nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, have revoked their support for their party's nominee one month from Election Day and with early voting already underway in some key states.\n\nThe audio and an accompanying video, released by The Washington Post and NBC News on Friday, recorded a conversation between Trump and \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush in which Trump described an attempt to have sex with a married woman. Trump brags in the tape about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous, and also uses a crude word for a part of a woman's anatomy.\n\nTrump apologized overnight for the comments, saying they \"don\u2019t reflect who I am.\" In videotaped remarks, he said, \"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.\"\n\nThroughout the day Saturday, several Republicans took the extraordinary step of revoking support for their party's nominee one month from Election Day and with early voting already underway in some key states. Many went further and called on Trump to quit the race altogether.\n\nRepublican leaders have scheduled a Monday morning conference call for House GOP lawmakers, who are out of town for Congress' election recess. The email obtained by The Associated Press does not specify the topic for the 11 a.m. EDT call, but rank-and-file lawmakers believe it's about Trump. Such calls are rare and usually held to discuss important matters.\n\nWhile still publicly backing Trump, the Republican National Committee is considering how to move forward. One possibility: re-directing its expansive political operation away from Trump and toward helping vulnerable Senate and House candidates. Such a move would leave Trump with virtually no political infrastructure in swing states to identify his supporters and ensure they vote.\n\nElection law experts suggest it would be logistically impossible to replace Trump on the ballot altogether, with early voting underway in some states and overseas ballots already distributed to military servicemen and others. Republican fundraising chief Spencer Zwick, however, said he's been fielding calls from donors who \"want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the GOP nominee.\" Zwick told the AP that a write-in or \"sticker campaign\" relying on social media could \"actually work.\" While there has never been a winning write-in campaign in a U.S. presidential contest, such an effort could make it harder for Trump to win.",
    " Title: Federal Worker Termination Process for IRS Employees May Take Time\n\nArticle:\n\nThe termination process for federal workers at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may take an extended period due to protections afforded to these employees. This is a potential disappointment for lawmakers who are pressing for the dismissal of IRS employees involved in the targeting of conservative groups.\n\nAt a hearing on Tuesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) expressed frustration, asking, \"Why weren\u2019t more people fired?\" However, it appears that no one has been formally reprimanded, and a spokesperson for the union representing IRS workers stated that the union has not been called to assist any employees yet.\n\nThe process for terminating IRS employees involves several steps. The incoming acting IRS Commissioner, Daniel Werfel, could attempt to clean house, but he would need to prepare for a lengthy appeals process.\n\nUnder federal rules, a fired government worker has the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The employee can challenge the decision, argue that their actions do not meet the threshold for termination, and ask to be reinstated, especially if there was no warning of trouble in past performance reviews.\n\nThe board is set up so fired employees appealing their termination get two chances to prove they should stay. Their first stop is at the merit board's regional level, which, for the Cincinnati-based IRS employees in question, would be in Chicago. The initial appeals take an average of 93 days to process, said William Spencer, a spokesman for the board.\n\nIf the regional board rules against the IRS employees, they could appeal to the national Washington, D.C.-based board, which takes an average of another 245 days. The IRS employees would not collect a paycheck during the appeals process. They would get back pay only if they are ultimately reinstated.\n\nMax Stier, who heads Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that recommends ways to improve the federal workforce, states it's \"not impossible\" to get rid of federal workers. In 2012, he says, 8,755 federal workers were fired, and others likely resigned to avoid the ax\u2014although there are no estimates of how many because it's hard to track those kinds of departures.\n\nThere's also the option of getting IRS employees out of the way more quickly\u2014at least temporarily\u2014by putting them on administrative leave. However, IRS workers could always fight back if they've had positive performance reviews until now\u2014and the board has been known to mitigate penalties if an employee is a first-time rule violator. Making this case about conduct does make it easier, however, to skip one part of the disciplinary rules for federal workers.",
    " Title: Congress Divided on Egypt Aid Amidst Military Coup Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of the U.S. Congress are currently divided on the issue of Egypt's $1.5 billion in foreign aid, with the U.S. law requiring the suspension of taxpayer funding to countries where a democratically elected government is deposed by a military coup.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee suggested that funding should continue, while Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island expressed reluctance to cut the foreign spending. However, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona is advocating for the purse strings to be cut in the wake of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi's ouster by the country's military.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, a House Republican, agrees with Sen. McCain and believes aid should be suspended until specific conditions are met, including the establishment of elections and a free press. Sen. Reed, on the other hand, expressed caution regarding the potential consequences of suspending or cutting off aid.\n\nSen. Corker suggested that Congress should not make rash decisions on funding and that the aid doesn't flow on a daily basis. Instead, he believes that Congress should assess the military and the country's handling of the transition.\n\nSen. McCain, appearing on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" described the military's action as a coup. He also stated that the United States should suspend aid until a new constitution and a free and fair election are established. However, he acknowledged that aid cannot be pulled back because it is \"in the pipeline.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama has not declared Morsi's ouster by the country's armed forces a military coup, but if such a declaration is made and recognized by the State Department, U.S. foreign aid would be eliminated.\n\nRep. Trey Radel, a Florida Republican, agreed with Sen. McCain and believes aid should be suspended until specific conditions are met. Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested that the U.S. should insist on a swift transition to a civilian government, with all parties participating, new elections for the next president, and the possibility of a new constitution.\n\nSen. Menendez also emphasized the need for an \"Egypt for all,\" stating that the $1.4 billion in aid is intended to protect domestic interests while helping Egypt along a path to democracy. U.S. leaders should insist on a swift transition to a civilian government, with all parties participating, new elections for the next president, and the possibility of a new constitution, Menendez said.\n\nIn a column published in Foreign Policy magazine before the overthrow, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, accused the administration of staying on the \"sidelines\" during the latest protests. Cruz wrote that the United States is \"entrenched as the partner of a repressive, Islamist regime and the enemy of the secular, pro-democracy opposition.\"",
    " Title: Amtrak Derailment Investigation: No Anomalies Found in Braking System or Signals\n\nArticle:\n\nA preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Tuesday indicates that no issues were found with the braking system or the signals and track at the site of the May 12 Amtrak derailment that resulted in eight fatalities and over 200 injuries. The train, Amtrak 188, was traveling from Washington, D.C., to New York City when it derailed north of Philadelphia at 9:21 p.m.\n\nThe NTSB report states that the train was traveling at 106 mph before the emergency brake system engaged. Data from the train's event recorder shows that the engineer activated the emergency brakes seconds before the derailment.\n\nThe NTSB is currently examining the Amtrak engineer's cell phone and cell phone records to determine if the engineer used the phone while operating the train. The report notes that cell phone records indicate calls were made, text messages sent, and data used on the day of the accident, but investigators have not yet determined if there was any phone activity during the time the train was being operated.\n\nInvestigators are also looking into the possibility of vandals throwing rocks or other objects at passing trains around the time of the derailment. The Amtrak 188 locomotive windshield has impact damage, but it is unclear whether the damage was caused by a thrown object or the crash itself. The report states that no evidence of damage caused by a gun was found.\n\nAmtrak estimates the damage from the crash at $9.2 million. The company has committed to installing an automatic braking system on all trains on its tracks in the Northeast Corridor by a congressional deadline of Dec. 31. However, a section north of New York City operated by Metro-North will not meet that deadline.\n\nThe deadline for positive train control was set by Congress following a head-on collision between a Metrolink commuter train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, Calif., in September 2008, which resulted in 25 fatalities and 100 injuries. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) reported about 300 injuries and 10 deaths in train accidents each year from 2003 through 2012, excluding highway-grade crossings and trespassers walking along tracks.",
    " Title: Lyft, Airbnb, and Stripe Speak Out Against Trump's Travel Ban, Yet Remain Invested in Peter Thiel\n\nArticle:\n\nRide-hailing service Lyft, home-sharing platform Airbnb, and payment processing company Stripe have all publicly expressed opposition to President Trump's controversial travel ban, while maintaining investments from Peter Thiel, a billionaire investor and advisor to Trump.\n\nLyft, which recently cracked the top 10 free apps on Apple's App Store, has pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over the next four years in response to the travel ban. The company has also faced criticism for its association with Thiel, who is a top tech advocate for Trump and has reportedly defended the travel ban.\n\nAirbnb's co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky denounced the ban as \"not right\" and announced the company would provide free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the U.S. Stripe's co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison pledged to match $50,000 in donations to the ACLU. Both companies count Thiel as an investor, but did not respond to CNNTech's requests for comment.\n\nArtsy, a startup whose CEO signed an open letter to Trump opposing the ban, downplayed Thiel's involvement in its business. \"Thiel was an early investor in Artsy and has no involvement in the day-to-day of the business,\" said Graham Newhall, a spokesman for Artsy.\n\nTech companies have faced criticism for speaking out against Trump's policies and rhetoric while refusing to distance themselves from Thiel. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, where Thiel is the longest-serving board member, framed the issue as allowing for diversity in all things, including politics.\n\nZuckerberg wrote in a post shortly before the election, \"We can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate.\" Zuckerberg spoke up against Trump's executive orders on immigration and refugees last week. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on Thiel.\n\nY Combinator president Sam Altman, who wrote a blog post Saturday calling on the tech industry to \"start speaking up\" against the Trump administration, struck a similar tone to Zuckerberg about Thiel. \"I do not believe that deciding to get rid of all founders/employees who voted for someone is much better than a Muslim ban,\" Altman wrote on Twitter in response to a comment on his ties to Thiel.\n\nPando, a tech publication that counts Thiel's Founders Fund as an investor, has published articles critical of Thiel and Trump. However, founder Sarah Lacy notes the challenges that startups face in speaking out against the influential investor. \"Entrepreneurs are under a lot of pressure and Thiel... [is] very powerful,\" Lacy told CNNTech. \"Think about it this way: Look at how many people at the very top of the food chain are not speaking out or are only doing so recently and in mealymouth ways.\"",
    " Title: Violent Riots Erupt Along Israel-Gaza Border as U.S. Embassy Opens in Jerusalem\n\nArticle:\n\nJerusalem \u2014 Violent riots erupted along the Israel-Gaza border on Monday, as the U.S. embassy officially opened in Jerusalem. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported that 43 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more were wounded in riots taking place at 12 locations along the border. The casualty numbers, which are expected to rise, could not be immediately verified, as Hamas has a history of exaggerating casualty claims.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that 50,000 Gazans are participating in the clashes. According to the IDF, three Gazans were shot while attempting to plant explosive devices at the border fence, while others were killed attempting to open fire on Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported numerous violent attacks during the riots, including protesters setting tires on fire, assaulting the border fence, hurling rocks at soldiers, and flying incendiary kites toward Israel. One such kite sparked a fire in a field outside Kibbutz Mefalsim, prompting Israeli firefighters and emergency personnel to respond.\n\nThe official Facebook page for the Gaza riots instructed followers on where to breach the border fence and attempt to infiltrate Israeli communities, some of which are located about 1.2 miles from the Gaza border. The Gaza riots' official Facebook page published photos directing rioters to breach the fence and infiltrate nearby Israeli communities.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Israel's Shin Bet Security Services revealed that Iran is funding some of Hamas's Gaza border chaos. The Shin Bet stated that Hamas is encouraging and sending protesters to the border fence to carry out violent acts and damage security infrastructure. In addition, Iran is providing funding to Hamas to carry out these violent activities along the Gaza Strip's border fence.\n\nThe Shin Bet further stated that Hamas is instructing its own members to stay away from the border until civilians breach the barrier. The Shin Bet warned that Hamas operatives will only enter Israel under the cover of the masses and carry out terror attacks once the security fence falls.\n\nOn Sunday, the IDF warned in a video that Hamas is planning to \"massacre\" Israelis if its terrorists infiltrate the Israeli border. The army dropped leaflets over Gaza warning residents against approaching the border, attempting to sabotage it, or carrying out terror attacks.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned Gazans on Monday against participating in Hamas's riots, stating, \"I suggest to the residents of Gaza: Do not be blinded by [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar, who sends your children to sacrifice their lives without hope.\" Lieberman added, \"We will protect our citizens by all means necessary and will not allow the fence to be breached.\"\n\nThis reporter previously analyzed some of the reasons Hamas may have organized the mass protests, including the group's understanding that the Gaza population is frustrated with 11 years of Hamas rule resulting in destructive wars and an economy dangerously teetering on the brink of collapse. Hamas's decision to turn Gaza into a terrorist enclave has prompted an Israel-Egypt boycott that has impacted all aspects of Gaza life, although Israel allows for truckloads of humanitarian goods and supplies to enter Gaza daily. Gazans are also suffering from the Hamas-Fatah divide, with the rulers of the West Bank and Gaza Strip failing to reach a reconciliation agreement that would likely result in the flow of aid to Gaza. Hamas views Israel's upcoming 70th anniversary and President Donald Trump's historic decision to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem as perfect opportunities to channel Gazans' anger and redirect the rage toward the easiest target\u2014Israel. Hamas knows the ensuing casualty count will bring international news media attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and it will thrust the issue to the forefront of the foreign policy debate. The border clashes may also press Egypt into easing the blockade and putting Egyptian pressure on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party to reach a reconciliation deal since Gaza tensions usually favor the jihadists operating against Egypt in the Sinai. Abbas must fear that the protests could spread to the West Bank and threaten his rule there. Lastly, Hamas may also be signaling to Iran and to other potential state patrons that Hamas is still the dominant player in Gaza and that it is useful to financially support the terrorist movement once again.",
    " Title: Trump Delays MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Amidst Criticism Over Juneteenth Holiday Timing\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced a change in the date of his planned # MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, originally scheduled for June 19th. In a series of tweets, Trump cited the Juneteenth Holiday, a significant commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States, as the reason for the change.\n\nIn a television interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump stated that the date was not chosen deliberately but described his rallies as celebrations. He further asserted that he has done more for the black community than any other president.\n\nThe timing and location of the rally have drawn heavy criticism from African American leaders and Democrats, who argue that the choice of Tulsa, the site of a 1921 massacre in which dozens of black people were killed and black-owned businesses destroyed, sends the wrong message, particularly in the wake of weeks of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nRep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), an African American woman considered as a possible running mate for Joe Biden, tweeted that \"Tulsa was the site of the worst racist violence in American history.\" She further stated that Trump's speech there on Juneteenth is a message to every Black American: \"more of the same.\"\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), also a black lawmaker on Biden's list of potential vice presidents, tweeted, \"This isn't just a wink to white supremacists\u2014he's throwing them a welcome home party.\"\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) commended Trump's decision to delay the rally, stating, \"I am thankful President Trump recognizes the significance of June 19 and has chosen to move his campaign rally out of respect to Oklahomans and the important Juneteenth celebrations.\"\n\nHowever, Oklahoma state Rep. Ajay Pittman (D), a member of the legislature's Black Caucus, argued that Trump only changed the date due to the backlash and not \"an attempt to respect\" the holiday.\n\nTulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum (D) seemed to try to temper potential protests of Trump's visit in a tweet on Thursday after the rally was first announced. \"In Tulsa, we protect the free and peaceful exchange of ideas. We did it during the last two weeks of protests, and we will do it during the President's visit to Tulsa next week,\" Bynum wrote.\n\nTrump's rallies, which typically draw thousands of supporters, have been on hold since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new date for the Tulsa rally has not been announced.",
    " Title: \"Brexit: Procedural Conflicts and Declining Trust in British Politics\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Brexit saga in the United Kingdom has been marked by a series of procedural conflicts and declining trust in politics among the public. The latest development, the passing of the April version of the Brexit bill, was partly due to Prime Minister Theresa May's recognition of her diminished political power, following her resignation. Her successor, Boris Johnson, is reportedly planning to use various tactics, including filibustering, to hinder the bill's progress in the unelected upper house.\n\nThe political process of Brexit, initially a contentious public affair, has largely been institutionalized, taking place through complex parliamentary procedures and court battles. The intricate language of parliamentary procedure, such as \"prorogation,\" \"humble addresses,\" and \"paving motions,\" is being interpreted by constitutional experts, who have seen an unprecedented demand for their expertise.\n\nPublic sentiment towards politics is largely negative, with only a third of people trusting politicians to act in the public interest, according to a study by the Hansard Society. Nearly half of the population feels they have no influence on decision-making.\n\nThe complexity of the Brexit issue, coupled with the European Union's intricate political sequencing, has led to disputes over procedural minutiae. However, the root cause of the escalating conflict in British politics has been domestic, with Prime Minister May's autocratic tendencies and avoidance of parliamentary consultation contributing significantly to the situation.\n\nMay's conduct, which led to court battles over the \"meaningful vote\" and the disclosure of the attorney general's legal advice, resulted in her being censured for \"contempt of Parliament.\" This censure epitomizes Johnson's approach to politics.\n\nThe prominence of procedural conflicts since the Brexit referendum has led to political questions being transformed into arguments about legal permissibility. Issues such as the kind of state Britain wishes to be, its relations among constituent nations, its immigration policies, its history in Ireland, and its economic integration with other European states are all intertwined in, or lost within, conflicts over parliamentary rights and legal obligations.\n\nThe result is a political landscape where seemingly dry matters suddenly gain intense, but displaced, political energy. This energy has manifested in high court judges being labeled \"enemies of the people\" by tabloid press and previously pacific sections of society becoming fervent protesters.",
    " Title: Tea Party Movement Experiences Resurgence Following IRS Scandal, Poll Shows Increased Favorability\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Tea Party movement, a grassroots political movement advocating for less government and lower taxes, is reportedly experiencing a resurgence following the revelation that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeted conservative groups and organizations for additional scrutiny in 2011 and 2012.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by Rasmussen Reports, 44 percent of likely U.S. voters now have a favorable opinion of the Tea Party, 14 percentage points higher than in January and just 7 points below the record high of 51 percent in April 2009. The poll also showed a decrease in the percentage of voters with an unfavorable opinion of the movement, down 5 points from earlier this year, to 44 percent.\n\nSal Russo, co-founder of the California-based Tea Party Express, told Fox News on Saturday that the movement is experiencing a spike in both interest and contributions since the IRS targeting scandal broke earlier this month. Russo also noted that Tea Party members feel vindicated and energized by the news.\n\nThe Tea Party movement began in 2009 as a reaction to the federal government's multibillion-dollar bank bailouts during the recession and played a significant role in the 2010 midterm elections by backing conservative candidates who helped Republicans take control of the House. However, critics argued during the 2012 election cycle that the movement had become less relevant.\n\nThe Rasmussen Reports poll also found that Tea Party support among Republicans surged from 61 to 80 percent. The increased support among Republicans could potentially impact the internal struggles within the party, particularly between the Republican-controlled House's conservative caucus and the more moderate chamber leadership.\n\nScott Rasmussen, the company president, told Fox News on Sunday that the IRS targeting scandal has the potential to thrust the Tea Party into the 2014 elections and that the scandal might have a bigger impact on Democrats. Rasmussen stated that the scandal \"really cuts into the heart of President Obama's agenda, which is faith in government,\" and that the large question is whether the Democrats' brand will remain tainted.\n\nRusso was enthusiastic about the 2014 elections, stating that he was working on potential races this weekend. However, he was uncertain about how long the scandal might remain in the voters' consciousness. \"It's too early to tell,\" he said. \"But a lot of people are looking at the Tea Party right now.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Reject Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Embrace Targeted Bills\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the immigration reform debate moves to the House, Republicans have largely rejected the Senate's comprehensive approach and instead are embracing a package of targeted bills. Key sponsors of the Senate legislation, however, are not giving up hope. They believe House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders will eventually embrace a broader package that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and enhanced border security.\n\nSen. Charles E. Schumer, a member of the so-called \"Gang of Eight,\" the bipartisan group of senators who helped shepherd the immigration bill through the Senate last week, expressed optimism during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" He stated, \"I believe by the end of this year, the House will pass the Senate bill. I know that\u2019s not what they think now, and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, no, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to happen,\u2019 but I think it will.\"\n\nThe Senate bill, which passed with the support of 14 Republicans and Senate Democrats, is considered the most significant step forward for immigration reform in nearly three decades. The legislation has been hailed as proof that bipartisan solutions to complex problems are possible, with Republican heavyweights such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida having played integral roles in drafting the legislation alongside Mr. Schumer and other Democrats.\n\nPresident Obama over the weekend set a timetable for the House to pass an immigration reform bill by the end of July. However, Mr. Boehner and other Republicans are rejecting that schedule and indicating that the House will take its own approach on immigration reform. They have cast aside the Senate bill that covered citizenship, border security, employment verification systems, and a host of other steps.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and border security, reiterated that position Sunday morning and dismissed Mr. Schumer's comments. \"We\u2019re not going to take his advice. The Senate bill is not going to pass in the House,\" Mr. Gowdy said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nRepublicans have several objections to the Senate bill, chief among them the fact that illegal immigrants will be granted a path to citizenship before the U.S.-Mexico border is fully secured. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican, referred to the Reagan-era immigration reform bill that promised to plug holes on the southwestern border alongside granting amnesty to many of those in the U.S. illegally, stating, \"The Senate bill gives legal status to 11 million people before it solves all the problems, securing the border...That\u2019s 1986.\"\n\nThe federal government failed to live up to its obligations on the security front, and Mr. Goodlatte, speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" program Sunday, said he doesn't want Congress to make the same mistakes again. Like his fellow Republicans, he said a \"step-by-step\" approach is preferable to the House majority's approach.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat and chairman of the House Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force, said House Republicans are casting aside the bipartisan work that the Senate has accomplished. \"What the House Republicans are doing is giving a Republican solution. A Republican solution isn\u2019t what we saw was successful in the Senate,\" he said, also appearing on CNN. \"It\u2019s a solution that\u2019s going to lead us to nothing.\"\n\nSen. McCain and other Senate Republicans who back the comprehensive package are nudging the House to action while acknowledging the difficult task Mr. Boehner faces. \"I believe Speaker Boehner has a tough job ahead. I admire his leadership, but we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\" said Mr. McCain, also appearing on Fox.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus Results Reflect Anti-Establishment Trend, Potential Shift in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa caucus results, held on Monday, have shown a clear trend towards anti-establishment candidates, with Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Ben Carson capturing approximately 60% of the Republican votes, and Bernie Sanders winning nearly half of the Democratic votes. This phenomenon, according to CNN columnist Edward Luce, represents a new brand in politics, symbolized by an upraised middle finger towards the American political elite.\n\nOn the Republican side, the top three candidates ran campaigns that were staunchly against the political establishment. Among Democrats, Sanders' campaign for a revolution resonated with voters, drawing a clear message of no confidence in the current economic order.\n\nIt is possible that each party may ultimately nominate a candidate closer to the center. For the Democrats, Hillary Clinton remains the favorite, and Marco Rubio's strong showing in the Iowa caucus may encourage GOP elites to believe they too can secure the nomination for a more moderate candidate.\n\nThe Iowa caucus results could have significant consequences for both parties. Sanders' strength is likely to draw Clinton further to the left on issues, as she will need to close the enthusiasm gap with Sanders and secure his support in a general election campaign.\n\nRepublican establishment figures will continue to be wary of a Cruz candidacy, but they will also have to acknowledge the strength on the extremes and the likelihood that Cruz will continue to do well in red state primaries. The Republican leadership will attempt to unite the party behind an anti-Cruz candidate, most likely Rubio, while also extending an olive branch to the far right.\n\nMore fundamentally, the Iowa caucus could signal a shift towards a more extreme form of American politics. The sluggish growth of the economy over the past 10 years has contributed to the anger and frustration among voters, and most economists believe this trend will continue, regardless of who is elected in November. This could mean that the Iowa caucus could be a forerunner of politics to come.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Iowa caucus represents only a tiny fraction of the American electorate, with Cruz winning the GOP caucuses with some 50,000 votes, which is about 2% of the state's registered voters. However, as history has shown, big changes in America often come from small towns and hamlets. As such, the 2016 race's first vote could be a harbinger of the politics to come.",
    " Title: Newtown Shooting's Impact on Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe aftermath of the tragic shooting incident in Newtown, Connecticut, has reportedly influenced the ongoing fiscal cliff negotiations between President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner. The shooting, which occurred on December 14, has prompted a shift in the political landscape, potentially providing party leaders with more room to maneuver in reaching a deal before the year-end deadline.\n\nOn Friday, after news of the shooting broke, Mr. Obama spoke by phone with Mr. Boehner. The following day, they met at the White House for 45 minutes, and by evening, the shape of a potential deal had emerged. However, the real test for any deal is whether it gets approved by enough lawmakers in both parties.\n\nJohn Feehery, a former adviser to three House Republican leaders, stated, \"It takes the fire out of the belly of partisans, just kind of puts everything in perspective and makes people question, well, everything. What's the point?\" Steve Elmendorf, a former top adviser to House Democratic leaders, added, \"The American people are going to be sharing in the grief of Connecticut families and will have little patience for political games and finger-pointing.\"\n\nReports suggest that Mr. Boehner had come some way toward the president's position over the weekend, offering for the first time to support raising the tax rate on high incomes and include an increase in the nation's debt limit, if the president agreed to more long-term reductions in entitlement programs.\n\nTom Daschle, a Democrat and former Senate majority leader, was initially skeptical about the shooting's impact on the fiscal negotiations. However, in a follow-up exchange of emails, Mr. Daschle acknowledged some moderating effect, stating, \"There might have been some genuine movement over the weekend.\"\n\nThe shooting's impact on the negotiations is significant, as both parties now face potential voter backlash if they appear to be engaging in politics as usual during this time of national mourning. The shooting could also make it more difficult for party leaders to call lawmakers back to the Capitol between Christmas and New Year's Eve to finish the work on the deficit, as members of Congress are likely to value time at home with their own children and grandchildren all the more.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats' Perception of Catholic Nominees and the Death Penalty Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the confirmation process for judicial appointments, some Senate Democrats have been criticized for their approach towards Catholic nominees who adhere to traditional Catholic teachings. According to reports, they are more likely to confirm Catholic nominees who reject authoritative Church teaching in favor of liberal views.\n\nThe recent confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the federal appeals court, a Catholic with a pro-life stance, has sparked concerns among Democrats. However, the irony lies in their apprehensions about Barrett's adherence to traditional Catholic views, as she has previously expressed opposition to the death penalty, a position that aligns with the views of many Democrats.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein's comments during Barrett's confirmation hearings were criticized for their bigotry and cluelessness. Feinstein was not chastising Barrett for holding a traditional Catholic view but for deferring to a modern liberal one held by many churchmen. This may be one of the reasons why Senator Tim Kaine, a liberal Catholic, voted to confirm Barrett.\n\nDemocrats have portrayed Barrett as a carbon copy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. However, on the subject of the death penalty and the recusal of Catholic judges, this comparison is not accurate. Scalia, unlike Barrett, did not show deference to the philosophical mess made by modern churchmen on the question of the death penalty.\n\nThe last pope, Joseph Ratzinger, acknowledged the Church's position on the death penalty as a matter of legitimate diversity of opinion, rather than a binding, infallible teaching. In a letter to the American bishops, Ratzinger wrote that while the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace and exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment.\n\nJustice Scalia, in an article for First Things, argued that the Church's current stance on the death penalty is not a moral position that the Church has always or ever before maintained. He suggested that the current predominance of opposition to the death penalty is the legacy of Napoleon, Hegel, and Freud rather than St. Paul and St. Augustine.\n\nThe Democrats' opposition to Barrett as a potential Supreme Court nominee creates a curious spectacle. While liberals are urging Senate Democrats to keep an opponent of the death penalty off the Supreme Court, many conservatives are urging President Trump to put her on it. In another era, the political positions might have been reversed. The left's visceral opposition to Barrett as a possible Supreme Court nominee highlights the Democrats' inability to tolerate pro-lifers who oppose the death penalty.",
    " Title: \"Language and the Debate Over Enhanced Interrogation Techniques: The Case of Gina Haspel's Confirmation Hearings\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over the use of enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States government has been marked by a long-standing disagreement over the definition of the term \"torture.\" This semantic battle has hindered clarity and progress on the issue, as demonstrated during the confirmation hearings for Gina Haspel, the nominee for Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nThe controversy surrounding the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, such as sleep deprivation, cramped confinement, and waterboarding, has been a contentious topic since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The crux of the issue lies in the misuse of the term \"torture,\" which connotes abuse of power, a desire to punish, or even sadistic satisfaction.\n\nOpponents of these techniques often label American practices as \"torture\" in an attempt to discredit them. Conversely, even defenders of these practices have found themselves embroiled in debates where they are perceived as \"defending torture.\" It is essential to clarify that there is no defense for torture, as defined, but the practices employed by American intelligence officers in the pursuit of vital intelligence are not what torture entails.\n\nOne such practice, waterboarding, has been particularly misconstrued. Waterboarding is not torture if it is used on American personnel during training or if it is employed in the cases of carefully screened detainees in an attempt to secure information vital to defeating jihadists and saving lives.\n\nThe use of waterboarding as a form of torture has been a contentious issue, with some comparing it to the experiences of individuals like John McCain, who was indeed tortured by the North Vietnamese. However, it is important to recognize the differences between the two situations. The near two decades spent speaking to veterans and active military personnel has shown that while not all support enhanced interrogations, the number of those who equate American practices with torture is minimal.\n\nDuring her confirmation hearings, Haspel seemed to struggle with the years-long mischaracterization of CIA techniques as torture. Under fire from disapproving Democrats, she stated that she would not oversee a return to such procedures, even under a lawful order from the President: \"I support the higher moral standard that this country has decided to hold itself to. I would never, ever take CIA back to an interrogation program.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over the use of enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States government has been marred by a long-standing disagreement over the definition of \"torture.\" It is crucial to recognize that these techniques, when employed in the pursuit of vital intelligence, are not what torture entails. The left must be commended for its success in redefining words, but it is essential to resist attempts to hijack the language for political gain. By doing so, we can have an honest debate about the pros and cons of how our nation has extracted intelligence from certain sources.",
    " Title: Bill Clinton Delivers Bravura Defense of President Obama at Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton delivered a passionate defense of President Barack Obama during the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, aiming to reassure voters in battleground states like Ohio and Michigan. Clinton's speech, which was a rebuttal to the Republican National Convention held last week in Tampa, focused on policy, numbers, and addressing the economic recovery under Obama's administration.\n\nClinton began his speech by stating, \"We are here to nominate a president, and I've got one in mind.\" He proceeded to counter the messages from the GOP convention, particularly those made by Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan and his Medicare and Medicaid spending proposals.\n\nOne of Clinton's key points was to bridge the gap between the two parties for voters concerned about the economy. He spoke of the economic crisis Obama inherited, with the economy shedding 750,000 jobs per month, and emphasized Obama's efforts to stop the economic downturn and build a foundation for recovery.\n\nClinton asked, \"Are we where we want to be today? Is the president satisfied?\" and followed with, \"But are we better off than when he took office?\" The former president's message was to renew Obama's contract and \"you will feel it.\"\n\nClinton also touched on the desire for a functioning government and leaders who compromise, as shown by polls. He highlighted Obama's commitment to constructive work and criticized the far right's perceived hatred of the president. Clinton concluded his speech with an onstage embrace with President Obama.\n\nThe article does not provide specific information on the reaction of the audience in the arena or at home in Ohio and Michigan, or any further details about the remaining undecided voters in battleground states after Clinton's speech.

    " Title: \"First Mixed-Race President's Legacy in Question as Race Relations Deteriorate\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWith eight months remaining in his presidency, Barack Obama, the first mixed-race president, is facing criticism for his handling of race relations in the United States. According to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 69 percent of Americans say race relations are generally bad, the highest level of discontent since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles during the Rodney King case.\n\nThe article suggests that Obama's approach to race issues has been more focused on identity politics than previously expected. The author points to incidents such as the rioting in Baltimore and Ferguson, the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge as evidence of this focus.\n\nThe article also discusses the theory of Everett Stonequist, a sociologist who wrote about the emergence of mixed-race leaders in his book \"The Marginal Man\" (1937). Stonequist posited that a primary cause of the mulatto's emergence as a race leader is \"the disparity between his aspirations and his status.\" The article questions whether Obama's adoption of an exclusive black identity was a calculated decision based on this perceived gap between his aspirations and his mixed-race status.\n\nThe article also touches on the differing perspectives of mixed-race Americans regarding their racial identity. Some, like poet and novelist Jean Toomer, advocate for a unified human race, while others view their European ancestry and the attendant colonialist history as irredeemably racist.\n\nThe author, Byrd, is a freelance opinion writer of white, black, and Cherokee heritage who lives in Queens, N.Y.

    " Title: Democratic National Convention Preview: Sanders-Clinton Tensions, Superdelegate Saga, and Rising Stars\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, taking place in Philadelphia this week, is set to be a significant event in the ongoing political landscape of the United States. The convention will likely see some tension between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, as some Sanders delegates are hoping to voice their concerns during the event.\n\nOne of the key issues for the Sanders camp is the so-called superdelegates, elected officials and party activists who wield convention votes and can decide who to support regardless of voting in their home states. The Democratic establishment is seeking to protect its perks, and Sanders' proposal to eliminate or reform the superdelegates ran into trouble in the convention rules committee. However, the proposed rules do call for a study, which may steer the commission toward Sanders' priorities.\n\nAnother focus of the convention could be the search for a rising star within the Democratic party. In 2004, Barack Obama made his big jump as a prime-time speaker at the convention that nominated John Kerry for president. This year, the list of Democratic prospects is not as long due to the Republican party's success in state and local elections during the Obama years.\n\nWillie Brown, a liberal activist and former San Francisco mayor, has been a fixture at Democratic conventions. He recalls the challenges African-American delegates faced in getting their credentials in the past.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump is heading west this week, aiming to make inroads in a region that has been difficult for him. Colorado, a swing state, is the prize Trump hopes to sway. Recent polls in Colorado have shown a steady lead for Hillary Clinton, but a more competitive Trump in Colorado could help tilt the electoral college.\n\nIn the coming days, political observers will be discussing these storylines, including the potential for Clinton-Sanders tensions, the superdelegate saga, and the search for a Democratic rising star.",
    " Title: The Ouster of Michael Flynn: A Question of Procedures and Accountability in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe resignation of Michael Flynn as the U.S. National Security Advisor has been a topic of significant debate, with some arguing that his removal was necessary, while others question the methods used to bring about his departure. The incident has sparked discussions about the state of America's democratic institutions and the role of the intelligence community in political affairs.\n\nFlynn's resignation was prompted by allegations that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition period, potentially contradicting official U.S. policy. The information about these conversations was leaked to the media, leading to widespread criticism and calls for his resignation.\n\nThe leaks, according to President Trump, are a significant problem and have been described as an \"enormous problem\" and \"weaponized spin.\" The leaks, it is argued, are an attempt to manipulate public opinion for political gain, undermining the democratic process.\n\nCritics of Flynn argue that his management style and his alleged actions are grounds for his removal. However, the issue at hand is not whether Flynn is guilty or innocent, but rather the role of the intelligence community in targeting a political appointee through leaks to the media.\n\nIn a liberal democracy, it is the role of elected members of Congress to conduct public investigations of alleged wrongdoing by public officials. The leaks, originating from the intelligence community, are seen as an attempt to circumvent this process, undermining the democratic process and the rule of law.\n\nThe use of leaks to target political opponents is a dangerous precedent, as it gives unelected officials the power to destroy reputations anonymously. This practice, as Eli Lake of Bloomberg News noted, is reminiscent of police states, where selective disclosure of private conversations can be used to manipulate public opinion and undermine democratic institutions.\n\nThe American people, in a democratic response to the failure of democracy, have the right to demand accountability and transparency from their elected representatives. Sitting back and allowing shadowy, unaccountable agents of espionage to do the job for them is not an acceptable alternative. The end goal should be to strengthen democratic institutions, not to weaken them through irregular acts of sabotage or disinformation campaigns.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in May, Adding 69,000 Jobs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday that employers added just 69,000 jobs in May, significantly lower than expected. This marks the slowest pace of hiring in a year, and hundreds of thousands of new jobseekers entered the labor market, causing the unemployment rate to rise to 8.2 percent.\n\nThe disappointing jobs report comes at a critical time for President Obama, as these months tend to shape voters' opinions about the economy as they prepare for the November election. Obama emphasized that the U.S. is still adding jobs, albeit not at a rapid enough pace.\n\nRepublican White House hopeful Mitt Romney seized on the report as evidence to criticize President Obama's handling of the economy. Romney argued that the president has had three and a half years to turn the economy around, and the U.S. should be in a robust recovery by now.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, attributes the slow hiring to several factors, including the sell-off in the stock market, the slowing growth in China, and the ongoing European debt crisis. Zandi stated, \"Businesspeople are just very nervous. They've been through a lot. If anything goes off-script, they pull back. They stop hiring.\"\n\nJared Bernstein, Vice President Joe Biden's former chief economist, argues that the struggling job market is less an indictment of the president's policies than the failure of Congress to pass them. Bernstein suggests that if the president's proposed policies, such as increased federal spending on public works projects and local government, had been implemented, the job market would not be in its current state. However, Congress has not approved this spending.\n\nNathan Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report, suggests that history indicates it is President Obama who will be held accountable for the economy if it does not improve before November. Gonzales stated, \"Voters just want to feel like the country and the economy are headed in the right direction. And I do not know if enough voters believe that right now to help the president win a second term.\"\n\nAt this point, there are not many months left to change voters' minds. The Obama campaign has been actively criticizing Romney's record on job creation during his tenure as governor of Massachusetts.",

The fire, which occurred on Prospect Avenue near Fordham University and the Bronx Zoo, is the deadliest in the city for at least 25 years, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nThe cause of the fire is not yet clear. The New York Police Department reported that a boy and three girls, aged one, two, and seven, had died. The first alarm sounded at the five-story building around 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT). The fire started on the first floor and quickly spread.\n\nMore than 160 firefighters helped bring the blaze under control. Television footage showed firefighters carrying people to safety from fire escapes. Residents who managed to escape huddled outside in bitterly cold conditions. The Red Cross handed out blankets to those on the street as some residents fled the building without shoes or coats.\n\nNew York City is experiencing a severe cold snap, and as temperatures dropped to around -10C (13F), the water from the firefighters' hoses could be seen turning to ice on the ground. Speaking at the scene, Mr. De Blasio said a nearby school had been set up to shelter those evacuated from the building.\n\n\"We're here at the scene of an unspeakable tragedy,\" Mr. De Blasio said. \"Tonight, here in the Bronx, there are families that have been torn apart. This is the worst fire tragedy we have seen in this city in at least a quarter century.\"\n\nHe added, \"Based on the information we have now, this will rank as one of the worst losses of life to a fire in many, many years.\"\n\nFire Commissioner Daniel Nigro, standing alongside the mayor, described the fire as \"a tragedy... without question historic in its magnitude.\"\n\n\"People died on various floors of the apartment [block],\" he told reporters, \"ranging in age from one to over 50.\"\n\n\"In a department that is surely no stranger to tragedy, we're shocked by the lives lost,\" he added.\n\nWitness Rafael Gonzalez, who lives in a building across the street, told WCBS-TV he was woken by the smell of smoke and then saw some people using a fire escape of the burning building as the fire raged.\n\nLuz Hernandez told the New York Times that her fourth-floor apartment had filled with thick smoke. She said she escaped through a fire escape with her husband and two sons as the smoke continued to rise around them.\n\nThe building contains more than 20 flats and was built just over 100 years ago. The Associated Press said the fire was the deadliest in New York - excluding the 9/11 attacks - since 87 people died at a social club in the Bronx in 1990.\n\nEarlier this month, a mother and her three children died in a fire at their home in Brooklyn, New York.",

I also found that some of the explanations I've gotten do not hang together. So in a sense, I have more questions today than when I first started.\"\n\nBarr has asked John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to examine the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation as more details emerge daily. The most recent revelations involve former FBI Director James Comey, former Director of Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA Director John Brennan, who reportedly used the unverified Steele dossier \u2013 opposition research paid for by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2013 in an effort to discredit President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe question remains as to who directed former FBI Director James Comey to brief President-elect Trump on the most salacious aspect of the dossier \u2013 the prostitutes in Moscow \u2013 in early January 2016. It is also unclear who leaked that information to the media, which ran with the story.\n\nIn his January 2016 meeting with President-elect Trump at Trump Tower, Comey stated that his mission was to inform Trump about that aspect of the dossier, but it is not clear who directed that \"mission.\" Comey also said he did not explain that the dossier was opposition research, and he did not know who leaked it to the press, nor did he ever try to find out.\n\nComey stated that President-elect Trump called him after word of the dossier leaked, and Fox News' Bret Baier asked Comey if he informed the president-elect at the time about the funding and those behind the dossier, as well as the fact that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI and had lied. Comey responded, \"No.\"\n\nBaier also asked Comey if he told Trump that the unverified dossier had been used, at least in part, to get a FISA warrant to spy on someone in the Trump campaign. Baier also asked Comey if it was fair to say that President Obama and his inner circle knew a lot more about the dossier and the scope of the investigation than President Elect Trump and his team. Comey responded, \"No, I do not think that's fair at all.\"",
    " Title: Lawmakers Express Doubts Over IRS's Ability to Administer Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nLawmakers from both political parties have expressed concerns about the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) ability to manage the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The doubts were raised during a hearing on Wednesday, with Republicans citing the rocky rollout of the health exchanges last year and the IRS's tarnished reputation following the tea party targeting scandal. Democrats, on the other hand, questioned the understanding of Americans regarding their obligations under the law.\n\nRep. Mike Thompson, a California Democrat, stated that after individuals sign up for health care, they typically move on with other aspects of their lives, implying that they may not review the website again.\n\nIn early 2023, Americans will be required to certify whether they have health insurance when filing their tax returns for the first time. While many will simply check a box, those who received tax credits to help pay for insurance purchased on the health exchanges will need to reconcile their subsidy payments, which were based on expected income, with their actual earnings.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen acknowledged that his agency has been reminding people to make the necessary adjustments. He testified before the House Ways and Means Committee's health panel.\n\nThe IRS is also responsible for enforcing the law's individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance unless they qualify for a specific exemption. Mr. Koskinen stated that the IRS will handle the workload, despite Congress not providing additional funding for the task.\n\nHowever, House Republicans questioned the fairness of the IRS's scrutiny, particularly in light of revelations that top officials in the tea party targeting scandal appeared to have a bias against Republicans. Rep. Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican, demanded assurances that the IRS would prevent a repeat of the Lois Lerner scandal, in which the former director of the IRS's Office of Exempt Organizations admitted her division used inappropriate criteria to scrutinize political groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\nSince the scandal, the IRS has claimed to have lost a set of Ms. Lerner's emails that could be relevant to the investigation. Rep. Roskam questioned the competence of the IRS's technology team, which will be responsible for administering Obamacare's provisions next year.\n\n\"Are these the same IT people that can't find Lois Lerner's emails and can't deal with hard drives?\" Rep. Roskam asked.\n\nMr. Koskinen stated that the IRS's auditing system prevents any one employee from singling out a specific taxpayer. However, his response to questions about subsidy overpayments may have undermined lawmakers' confidence in the agency when he remarked, \"Wherever we can, we follow the law.\"\n\nPanel Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, encouraged the commissioner to \"follow the law in all instances.\" Mr. Koskinen suggested that Congress could help the IRS carry out its new duties by providing an additional $430 million during the budget process, including $300 million for systems to help the IRS administer its share of Obamacare.\n\nRep. William J. Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, accused House Republicans of withholding funding as part of an effort to dismantle Obamacare. \"If you can't shoot the dog, starve it,\" he said. \"That's what this is all about.\"",
    " Title: Wife of Ray Rice Defends Husband, Criticizes Media Handling of Domestic Violence Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nJanay Rice, the wife of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, defended her husband on Tuesday in an Instagram post, criticizing the media for its handling of the domestic violence incident involving the couple.\n\nIn the post, Janay Rice wrote, \"I woke up this morning, feeling like I had a horrible nightmare, feeling like I'm mourning the death of my closest friend. But to have to accept the fact that it's reality is a nightmare itself.\"\n\nRay Rice, 27, was released by the Ravens on Monday and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after a video surfaced showing him punching Janay, then his fianc\u00e9e, and knocking her out in the elevator of a New Jersey casino in February.\n\nThe video, which went viral when it surfaced on Monday, shook the NFL and even prompted a statement from the White House on domestic violence. Earlier video of the incident showed Rice dragging an unconscious Janay from the elevator, and in July he was suspended for two games by the league and fined $500,000.\n\nBut after video surfaced on Monday of him punching Janay inside the elevator, her head hitting a rail before she crumpled to the floor, Rice was cut from the team and suspended indefinitely by the NFL.\n\n\"No one knows the pain that the media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family,\" Janay Rice wrote on Instagram. \"To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday is a horrible thing.\"\n\nThe NFL said it had not seen the new video until Monday, when it was released by the website TMZ. But TMZ said on Tuesday sources \"connected\" with the Revel Hotel and Casino said no one from the NFL asked for the video from inside the elevator.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell admitted he \"didn't get it right\" when he initially suspended Rice for two games and has strengthened the sanctions for NFL players who commit domestic violence.\n\nJanay Rice, who married Ray Rice shortly after the casino incident, accused the media of using the episode to \"gain ratings.\"\n\n\"THIS IS OUR LIFE! What do you all not get,\" she wrote. \"If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take all happiness away, you've succeeded on so many levels.\"\n\n\"Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is! Ravensnation we love you!\" she added.\n\nRice was indicted by a grand jury in March on third-degree aggravated assault but the charge was dropped because Janay declined to testify against him. He agreed to court-supervised counseling.\n\nRice had his worst NFL season last year and it remained unclear if he will ever play again.\n\nNew England Patriots owner Robert Kraft told \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday anyone who saw the video would be \"outraged and really disgusted.\" He praised Goodell's handling of the situation, saying the commissioner had no knowledge of the second video before its release Monday, and for setting a clear policy of proper conduct in the NFL.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama \"believes that domestic violence is contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society.\"",
    " Title: Senate's Shift in Support for Pro-Life Policies: A Look at the Evolution of Abortion Debate in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate on abortion in the United States has been a topic of intense discussion, with the anniversary of Roe v. Wade serving as a significant milestone for reflection. The article discusses the changing perspectives on abortion, highlighting the impact it has on families and the advancements in science that have led to a clearer understanding of the development of a fetus in the womb.\n\nIn 2014, the American people elected a new Senate majority, which strongly believes in the value of unborn children. This shift was evident in the summer of 2015, when a bill aimed at redirecting Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funding to community health centers was introduced. The bill aimed to address the controversy surrounding the organization's alleged trafficking of fetal tissue. Despite garnering a majority of support from both Republican and Democratic senators, the bill fell five votes short of the required 60 votes needed to open debate in the Senate.\n\nThe article notes that this was an encouraging reminder of the pro-life movement's progress, as a similar vote in 2011 was 18 votes shy of the required 60-vote threshold. The article also highlights the passage of a bill to defund Planned Parenthood in 2015, which was vetoed by President Obama.\n\nThe article also discusses the stark difference between the current and previous Senates on the issue of life, citing attempts to overturn the Mexico City policy and the \"Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act.\" The article concludes by emphasizing the pro-life community's progress and the momentum on the side of life, with a majority of Americans wanting all or most abortions made illegal, according to a May 2015 Gallup poll.\n\nThe article is written by James Lankford, the junior senator from Oklahoma, and Ben Sasse, the junior senator from Nebraska. The authors express their gratitude for the progress made in the pro-life movement and their hope for continued progress in the future. The article concludes with a call to action, emphasizing the importance of upholding one's duties as a citizen and speaking out for the vulnerable, including unborn children.",
    " Title: Progressives Called to Listen, Not Condescend, in Conversations with Trump Supporters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, conversations between supporters of President Donald Trump and opponents can often be challenging. Andrew Redlawsk, a Democratic organizer and activist, shares his experience of such a conversation with a lifelong friend who admitted to voting for Trump.\n\nRedlawsk, who is currently pursuing his Masters in Political Management at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., emphasizes the importance of understanding the reasons behind conservative views, rather than labeling them as bigoted or ignorant.\n\nRedlawsk argues that those who voted for Trump are primarily individuals who view progressivism as an attack on traditional American values, such as the idyllic image of America as a Norman Rockwell painting, with white picket fences, suburban life, baseball, apple pie, and the American flag.\n\nHe suggests that progressives should respectfully propose that their causes align with the patriotism and love for America held by Trump supporters. By acknowledging the shared desire for a better America, progressives can demonstrate that their goals are not antithetical to traditional American values but rather an extension of them, aimed at ensuring equal opportunities for all.\n\nRedlawsk encourages progressives to put aside their anger and hate, take responsibility for creating change, and engage in open, respectful dialogue with those who hold different views. He argues that vilifying, shaming, and condemning only serves to entrench opposing views, and that progressives must be willing to guide others through the process of change.\n\nIn conclusion, Redlawsk calls on progressives to listen, teach, and learn to understand the perspectives of others, rather than insulting, shaming, or condescending. By doing so, he believes, progressives can encourage change and work towards a more inclusive and equitable America.\n\nRedlawsk's piece is a response to a Trump voter, Sophia Buono's, article, which can be found here.

    " Title: CBO's Predictions on Obamacare: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has been under scrutiny regarding its predictions on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). However, it is inaccurate to claim that the CBO was \"way, way off\" in every aspect of its predictions, as the White House has suggested.\n\nThe CBO's prediction of the overall impact of the law on the uninsured was relatively accurate. It projected that the percentage of people under the age of 65 who would lack insurance would decrease, and this turned out to be the case. In 2016, the nonelderly rate was 10.3%, while the CBO had predicted it would be 11%.\n\nThe CBO overestimated the number of people who would get government-subsidized coverage through the new insurance exchanges. However, it underestimated the number who would get coverage through expanding Medicaid. The CBO predicted 10 million would be added to the Medicaid rolls by 2016, but the actual number was 14.4 million as of the first quarter of 2016, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\n\nIn terms of the total number of people gaining coverage, the CBO's prediction of 30 million uninsured in 2016 was close to the actual number, which was 27.9 million during the first nine months of 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey.\n\nIn percentage terms, the CBO predicted 89% of the nonelderly would be covered by 2016, and the actual percentage was 89.7%.\n\nThe CBO's predictions were closer to 2014 reality than those of four other forecasters, including the Obama administration's own figures, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute, and the Lewin Group, a health industry consulting firm.\n\nIn January 2016, the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund published an analysis by New York University's Sherry Glied of CBO's forecast of the ACA's effects. Glied called CBO's predictions \"reasonably accurate\" compared with actual results in 2014.\n\nOn March 13, 2017, the CBO issued another projection of the Obamacare repeal bill being considered by the Republican-controlled House. The CBO estimated that under the GOP's American Health Care Act, 14 million fewer people would have health insurance next year than under current law, and that number would rise to 24 million in 2026.",
    " Title: Power and Corruption: A Look at the Misuse of Office for Private Gain\n\nArticle:\n\nThe EPA administrator Scott Pruitt testified on Capitol Hill on April 26, 2018. The question of whether power leads to corruption among promising administrators has been raised, with some suggesting that power can lower the cost of indulging human nature.\n\nThe article discusses the correlation between power, status, and human nature. It argues that power, in the form of money, fame, celebrity, authority, or a combination of these, lowers the cost of indulging human nature. The rich can afford their vices and indulgences in ways that the poor cannot, and humans also desire status, with those who have more status craving for even more.\n\nThe article cites examples of excessive demands and abuses of power by celebrities and government officials. It highlights the case of televangelist Jesse Duplantis, who asked his congregation for $54 million to purchase a private jet, and the example of a famous TV personality who demanded hot chocolate through an office intercom without specifying who should fulfill the request.\n\nThe article argues that the misuse of authority by government officials is particularly egregious. It mentions the Trump White House, with Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, as an example of a wealthy government official who uses her private jet to save taxpayer money. However, the article also notes that DeVos and other wealthy members of the administration seem to be arousing envy in their colleagues, with Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, being the most infamous example.\n\nPruitt has been accused of abusing his authority in petty and silly ways, such as sending his grandiosely praetorian security detail to fetch him special hand lotion and allegedly using his aides to get a discount on a used mattress. He has also been accused of trying to finagle jobs for his wife and has been under scrutiny for other questionable actions.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the perks of working in government are inherent to the job, not to the person holding it. It suggests that under President Obama, it was a staple of conservative rhetoric to note that America isn't a monarchy, but they don't act like it.",
    " Title: Connecticut, California, Illinois, and New York Face Pension Debt Crises\n\nArticle:\n\nConnecticut, California, Illinois, and New York are currently grappling with significant pension debt crises. According to a former governor of Indiana, Mitch Daniels, Connecticut's debt, worth over $53 billion, could potentially lead to taxpayers bailing out the state.\n\nConnecticut, despite being one of the richest states per capita, is not alone in this predicament. California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York also face similar challenges in making pension payments to retired government workers.\n\nIn Illinois, for instance, vendors often wait months to be paid by a government that is $30 billion in debt, and whose bonds are just one notch above junk bond status, according to Daniels. California's debt exceeds $428 billion, New York's debt surpasses $356 billion, and New Jersey's debt is over $104 billion.\n\nThe heavily Democratic legislature in Trenton, New Jersey, has reportedly resisted tax increase proposals from Governor Phil Murphy, suggesting a potential shift in approach to fiscal management. However, the exact nature of this shift and its impact on the state's fiscal woes remains unclear.\n\nThe ongoing debt crises in these states, according to Daniels, indicate a day of reckoning may be approaching after decades of irresponsible fiscal policies. This group of states, often referred to as the \"blue state madness\" crew, continues to grapple with the consequences of their financial decisions.",
    " Title: State Insurance Regulators Face Uncertainty Over Obama's Healthcare Policy Change\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's recent announcement to allow insurance companies to sell policies that do not comply with the Affordable Care Act for another year has caused confusion and concern among state-level insurance commissioners and companies. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) stated that it is unclear how the proposed changes can be implemented at this late stage.\n\nThe announcement was intended to address the concerns of millions of Americans who have lost their current insurance plans due to the Affordable Care Act. The change could cause chaos for insurance companies and state commissioners, as it may disrupt the financial balance the industry was trying to achieve, potentially leading to higher premiums for others.\n\nPremiums for next year have already been set based on the assumption of when consumers will transition to the new marketplace. If fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase, and there will be fewer choices for consumers, according to America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) President and CEO Karen Ignagni.\n\nLogistical challenges also arise, as companies will need to reach out to customers who have already received cancellation notices, and insurance commissioners will need to reassess rates and plans for 2014, which have already been set. Some states, such as Washington and Oklahoma, have already expressed reluctance to implement the administration's sudden change.\n\nInsurance commissioners in various states are struggling to figure out how they might implement the administration's change, with some suggesting that the president is shifting the burden and blame to insurance companies and state commissioners. Republicans argue that Obama may not even have the authority to make this change administratively, which led to a vote on a bill on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe GOP-backed bill would not only let people extend their plans for another year but also allow other individuals who did not have such coverage to opt for those plans. Obama has threatened to veto the bill.\n\nWendell Potter, a former executive at Cigna, suggested that some insurance companies might take up the president's offer to make money off those policyholders. Potter believes the main reason the administration is making this change is due to the federal exchanges not working effectively. Eventually, he said, people will find better policies when the exchanges start functioning properly.",
    " Title: Cruz and O'Rourke Debate in Texas: A Closer Look at the Second Debate in the Competitive Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the second debate of the closely contested race for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas, incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz and his challenger, Beto O'Rourke, focused on their respective bases while largely avoiding personal attacks. The debate, which delved into domestic issues, contrasted with criticisms that American campaigns spend too little time on the issues.\n\nThe candidates discussed taxes, U.S. policy on climate change, immigration, judicial philosophy, and health care. Sen. Cruz, the Republican incumbent, emphasized his goal of tax cuts, while O'Rourke presented himself as a moderate Democrat advocating for universal health care.\n\nDespite the debate's focus on domestic matters, it was initially intended to feature more questions on foreign affairs. The only question about foreign affairs was regarding trade and tariffs. The candidates sparred on various issues, with both men providing detailed explanations of their agendas and expressing disapproval of the other's positions.\n\nSen. Cruz, in his closing remarks, highlighted the contrast between their positions, stating, \"I want to cut your taxes; Congressman O'Rourke wants to raise your taxes.\" He also emphasized the importance of maintaining the current economic boom. O'Rourke, on the other hand, sought to portray himself as a bipartisan collaborator who wants to improve healthcare access for all.\n\nWhen the two debated previously, O'Rourke was within striking distance of Cruz, and one poll even gave him a 1-point lead. However, the polls have since shifted in Cruz's favor, with the incumbent currently holding a 7-point advantage in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls.\n\nDespite the polling trends, O'Rourke remains much closer than any other Democrat in a statewide race in the GOP-dominated Lone Star State, and the race has garnered intense national interest as Democrats aim to retake Congress. While O'Rourke remained calm and composed, he was more forceful in his criticisms of Cruz compared to their first debate.\n\nCruz repeatedly pointed out O'Rourke's support for the impeachment of President Trump, a position O'Rourke has been careful not to express in either debate. O'Rourke countered by accusing Cruz of being all talk and no action. The debate also addressed other contentious issues, including the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the deficit, and the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBoth candidates have faced criticism during the debate, with O'Rourke being questioned for voting against a relief bill for Hurricane Harvey victims, and Cruz being questioned about his support for tax cuts while also voting for tax breaks in 2017.\n\nAs the debate concluded, both candidates highlighted their fundraising efforts. O'Rourke's campaign entered the debate after a record-breaking fundraising quarter, raising $38.1 million. O'Rourke attributed this to his broad appeal and his commitment to representing all Texans, while Cruz argued that much of O'Rourke's funds have come from donors outside the state, drawn by a brand of liberalism more common in left-wing coastal areas.",
    " Title: National Security Concerns in Comprehensive Immigration Reform Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Boston Marathon bombing has reignited discussions about the need for national security improvements in the United States, particularly in relation to immigration and visa policies. The tragedy has raised questions about how two individuals, who allegedly committed acts of terrorism, were able to immigrate from the Chechen Republic in Russia, a known hotbed of Islamic extremism.\n\nThe immigration and visa system should provide increased scrutiny for individuals from high-risk areas of the world. The flawed visa system was a significant factor in the intelligence failure that led to the September 11 attacks, as noted by National Review's Kevin Williamson. If the law enforcement and intelligence agencies had been more competent in visa overstays and application screening, at least 15 of the 19 September 11 hijackers would have been caught.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, there was comprehensive reform of the intelligence-gathering system, but the current system still failed to adequately detect the latest extremists. The deceased Boston attack suspect was interviewed at the request of a foreign government two years prior to the bombing, but there was no follow-up to the interview. Details about the interview, potential causes for suspicion, and the need for further inquiry remain unclear.\n\nBoth suspects were legal permanent residents, with one being a naturalized citizen and the other on the path to citizenship. The current immigration and visa system's deficiencies that allowed this are under scrutiny, as is the ability to detect extremist behavior in those still on the path to citizenship.\n\nIn 2002, Congress created the National Security Registration System, which was suspended by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet A. Napolitano in 2011. The system, which aimed to provide extra screening for immigrants from nations with a higher population of extremists, needs to be revisited and reinstituted as part of any comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nIn Kentucky, the refugee program has proven problematic, as two Iraqi citizens living in Bowling Green were sentenced to long prison terms for participating in terrorism and providing material support to terrorists while living in the United States. The current immigration reform should address how this might have happened, and more scrutiny is needed when accepting refugees from high-risk nations.\n\nThere is a need for a thorough examination of student visas, with potential suspensions of visas from high-risk areas pending an investigation into the national security implications of this program. Any new legislation must address the visa entry and exit programs, in addition to refugee programs that have proven problematic in Bowling Green.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees, has emphasized the need for national security concerns to be part of the comprehensive immigration-reform debate. It is Congress's job to ensure the federal government is doing everything it can to prevent would-be terrorists from using a flawed immigration system against the United States.",
    " Title: Florida State University Students Shot in Library Incident; Gunman Killed by Police\n\nArticle:\n\nThree Florida State University (FSU) students were shot and wounded inside the Strozier Library early Thursday morning. The gunman, identified as Myron May, was an alumnus of the school and a lawyer who was later killed by police.\n\nAccording to a law enforcement official, the shooting occurred at about 12:30 a.m. when the armed suspect entered the Tallahassee building and opened fire. The official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release the name, stated that Myron May, a graduate of FSU before attending Texas Tech University's law school, was the shooter.\n\nDavid Taunton, who runs a foster home in the Florida Panhandle, told FoxNews.com that May had stayed at a guest house in a rural area for the past three weeks. Taunton, who knew May through his sons who ran track together in high school, described May as \"a good kid as it gets.\"\n\nMay seemed normal until he disappeared Friday night after dinner with his grandmother, according to Taunton. Taunton sent May an email to check on him, and May responded, \"I'm so sorry\" referring to not checking in. \"I'm all right.\"\n\nMay confided something with Taunton that \"raised worry.\" However, Taunton would not go into details of their last conversation. Police interviewed Taunton after the shooting, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe scene at the library was chaotic, with students running and taking refuge in private study rooms. Sean Young, a student at the school who was on the third floor of the building, told WCTV.tv that students ran past him and some took refuge in a private study room rented by a fraternity.\n\nSarah Evans, another student from the school, from Miami, said she was inside the library and heard a male student say he had been shot. When she looked at him, he was on the ground with blood spreading on his pants leg.\n\nThe unidentified suspect made his way outside to the entrance of the building, where he was confronted by campus police who ordered him to drop his weapon. The gunman disregarded the order and fired a shot at the officers. Police returned fire and fatally hit the man.\n\nHours after the shooting, detectives could be seen inspecting the body of the suspected gunman, who was lying face down at the top of an access ramp just outside the library. A gray baseball cap lay near his head.\n\nWCTV.tv reported that all three victims were located around the library. The report said one student is in critical condition, another is stable, and one was treated at the scene and released. Police did not say if the wounded were shot by the gunman.\n\nTallahassee Memorial HealthCare said as of 10:30 a.m. Thursday, the condition of the patients had not changed.\n\nIn a press conference Thursday morning, police assured that the shooting was an isolated incident, and there is no further threat on campus. University officials said campus will remain open Thursday, but all classes are canceled.\n\nA nursing supervisor at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare told the Associated Press that the hospital was treating two people for gunshot wounds early Thursday.\n\nShortly after 4 a.m., a loud tone sounded across the campus followed by an announcement that the campus was \"all clear.\"\n\nDavid Sillick, the publisher of Jacksonville Business Journal, told FoxNews.com that he received a text message from his daughter during the shooting, saying, \"There's a man with a gun in the library. I love you.\" She called a few minutes later to say police were at the scene, and she was fine.\n\n\"We didn't know what was happening so I monitored Twitter,\" Sillick said. \"A message like that is every parent's worst fear.\"\n\nHours later, detectives could be seen inspecting the body of the alleged gunman. He was lying face down at the top of the access ramp just outside the library.\n\nA telephone alert from the university urged people to stay away from doors and windows. The alert provided no details of what sparked the warning. FSUNews.com reported that students were on lockdown in a second library and in the university dormitories.\n\nFlorida State President John Thrasher, who took office earlier this month, said in a statement Thursday, \"The community is saddened by the events.

    " Title: Partisan Divide Marks 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the historic March on Washington, a significant milestone in the struggle for civil rights in the United States, is being commemorated this week with separate events by both Republicans and Democrats, reflecting a persistent partisan divide on issues of race in America.\n\nA new national poll indicates a divide between the two parties over whether Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream, as expressed in his \"I Have a Dream\" address, has been achieved. Political issues involving race, such as voting rights and high minority unemployment, continue to split Americans along party lines.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey released last week, 49% of Americans say \"a lot more\" needs to be done to achieve King's dream, with just over three in ten saying \"some more\" needs to be done and 16% saying little or nothing needs to be accomplished.\n\nThe poll reveals a disparity in views between Republicans and Democrats on the question. Thirty-five percent of Republicans surveyed say \"a lot more\" needs to be done to reach racial equality. This number jumps to 63% among Democrats questioned in the survey, which was conducted in early August.\n\nLouisiana's Republican Governor Bobby Jindal, who made history in 2008 as the first Indian-American to serve as governor in the country, wrote in Politico on Monday that, despite progress made on racial equality since King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, there remains a sense of division among Americans.\n\n\"We still place far too much emphasis on our'separateness,' our heritage, ethnic background, skin color, etc.,\" he wrote. \"We live in the age of hyphenated Americans: Asian-Americans, Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Indian-Americans, and Native Americans, to name just a few. Here's an idea: How about just 'Americans?'\"\n\n\"We are all created in the image of God \u2013 skinny, fat, tall, short, dark, light, whatever. Who cares? What does it matter? It's time to get over it,\" he continued. \"It's time for the end of race in America. Now that would be progress.\"\n\nJindal's essay was penned as Republican and Democratic politicians hold separate events to mark the anniversary of King's speech and the March on Washington, which in 1963 drew hundreds of thousands of Americans to the National Mall in Washington.\n\nA Saturday rally, organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network along with Martin Luther King III and the NAACP, featured speeches from Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, as well as Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights leader who now serves as a Democratic congressman representing parts of Atlanta.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder and Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in the Garden State, also spoke.\n\nOn Wednesday, which will be 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, President Barack Obama will deliver remarks at a rally in the same spot. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will also attend and address the crowd.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush was invited to attend but declined since he's recovering from a heart procedure earlier this summer. Bush had a stent placed in his heart on August 6 and left the hospital a day later.\n\nNo Republicans are scheduled to speak at the Wednesday event. Instead, the Republican National Committee is hosting a luncheon on Monday to commemorate the anniversary that features the party's chairman Reince Priebus and prominent African-American Republicans, including T.W. Shannon, the speaker of Oklahoma's state House of Representatives, and former Rep. Allen West of Florida, who lost his bid for re-election last year.\n\n\"I think the RNC and chairman Priebus' timing on commemorating that event was well worth it,\" Shannon said on CNN later Monday. \"If you look at the attendance that we had, we had people from all walks of life that came to the luncheon to participate to recognize that not only are we honoring the man, but we were honoring an idea.\"\n\nAlso attending the event was Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who's been a leading GOP voice on rewriting portions of the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court gutted its key provisions in June.\n\nSaying the court had \"thrown a monkey wrench\" into the law, he said it was lawmakers' responsibility to fix it.\n\nRepublican lawmakers also marked the march's anniversary in July, before leaving for August's recess, with an event in the U.S. Capitol led by House Speaker John Boehner.",
    " Title: A Century of Meetings: The Evolution of U.S. President-Pope Encounters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe meeting between Pope Francis and President Obama at the White House continues a tradition going back nearly a century between U.S. presidents and the head of the Roman Catholic Church. These talks are private, often personal, and always take place against the backdrop of the politics of the time.\n\nThe tradition began in 1919, when President Woodrow Wilson visited Pope Benedict XV at the Vatican. Initially, there was no plan for Wilson to meet the pontiff, but an American cardinal suggested the visit during Wilson's six-month tour of Europe, which included Italy. The meeting discussed the recovery effort, but politics were also on Wilson's mind, as the growing Catholic population in U.S. cities was becoming a significant force within the Democrat Party.\n\nForty years later, Dwight D. Eisenhower met with John XXIII, marking a gap in the tradition due to the Great Depression and World War II, as well as persistent anti-Catholic bias in the U.S. This bias was a factor in the 1960 campaign of John F. Kennedy, who was the only Catholic president. He addressed the issue in a speech to put to rest worries that he'd be a tool of the pope.\n\nKennedy traveled to Rome and Vatican City as president, and his motorcade was met by huge crowds. It was a proud moment for many American Catholics, but it was also a relatively new pontiff Kennedy met, as Pope Paul VI had been coronated just two weeks earlier following the death of his predecessor.\n\nTwo years later, Paul VI became the first pope to visit the U.S., traveling to New York City to meet with President Lyndon B. Johnson. Since then, every U.S. president has met with the pope, but it wasn't until 1979 that a pontiff visited the White House. Jimmy Carter was in office and welcomed John Paul II, calling him \"our new friend.\"\n\nThe meeting between Carter and John Paul II is considered one of the most important, as both were men of deep Christian faith. John Paul and Carter hit it off, and the session helped make possible the opening of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Vatican five years later.\n\nJohn Paul II, a \"committed anti-communist and Cold Warrior,\" met Ronald Reagan in 1987 during a papal visit to the U.S. Reagan was eager to join the young, charismatic pope in the effort to combat communism. In 1981, the U.S. had a new president, Ronald Reagan, who was eager to join the young, charismatic pope in the effort to combat communism.\n\nIn 27 years, John Paul held more than a dozen meetings with U.S. presidents. One of the most famous\u2014and most uncomfortable for an American leader\u2014came late in his life, in 2004 with George W. Bush. The setting was the Vatican, and the pope was opposed to the U.S. war in Iraq. Despite the criticism, Bush later spoke warmly about the pope.",
    " Title: The Submerged Subsidy: The Role of Job-Based Health Insurance in U.S. Healthcare\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent Economist/YouGov poll reveals a significant disconnect between the American public's understanding of health care policies and the reality of government involvement in the U.S. health care system. This disconnect is largely attributed to the existence of a \"submerged\" government program that provides substantial support for job-based health insurance.\n\nThe majority of Americans with health insurance receive some form of government assistance. For the elderly, this comes in the form of Medicare, while the disabled and the poor are covered by Medicaid. Full-time workers receive tax subsidies for employer-provided health insurance.\n\nSome of the misunderstanding stems from older Americans' lack of awareness about Medicare or their belief that they have \"paid for\" their benefits through earlier taxes. However, Americans who receive insurance from their jobs are also benefiting from this hidden yet substantial government program.\n\nThe tax system allows employers to pay for health insurance without taxing the employee's income. This makes it more efficient for employers to offer health insurance as part of their compensation package. The regulations ensure that job-based insurance is available to workers with substantial health care needs, who would be uninsurable on a free market.\n\nThe subsidy is subtle, part of what Suzanne Mettler calls the \"Submerged State,\" but without it, health insurance as we know it would not exist. This system works well for employees of large companies due to the large risk pools they provide. However, it does not work well for the self-employed, small businesses, contractors, part-time workers, those who get laid off, or entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act aims to address this issue by creating a parallel system of subsidies for those without job-based care and by paring back the tax subsidy for the most expensive job-based plans. Most conservative health policy experts propose leveling the playing field by eliminating or curtailing the subsidy for job-based plans. Avik Roy, a leading conservative health wonk, refers to this subsidy as the \"original sin\" of American health care policy.\n\nHowever, the public's understanding of this issue remains limited, with a significant portion of the health policy debate centered around a subsidy that the public is largely unaware of.",
    " Title: Rep. Devin Nunes Expresses Concern Over Tech Giants' Alleged Bias Against Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, has expressed concern over the alleged censorship of conservatives by tech giants such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, and others. In an exclusive appearance on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 this weekend, Nunes, who is currently suing Twitter in Virginia, stated that the company has been the worst offender and that tech companies have been able to bias against conservatives for years due to a special \"carveout\" in federal law.\n\nNunes argued that the tech giants have warped their products into pushing a certain ideology rather than being open platforms since President Donald Trump's election in 2016. He claimed that these companies, especially Twitter, enforce their rules selectively and operate their properties negligently, citing his own experiences with the platform.\n\nNunes suggested that the easiest solution to this problem would be for the tech companies to return to being open platforms, but he does not have faith they will do so. He proposed that they should operate their properties like an open square, only intervening if there is a breach of federal or state law. As for Google, he suggested they should stop the bias in their search results.\n\nNunes also believes that the Democrats' talk of regulating or holding tech companies accountable is a \"fake threat,\" intended to intimidate them into supporting the left's agenda. Given that Democrats are in the majority in the House of Representatives, Nunes stated that there is \"nothing\" Congress can do to combat the tech giants until after the 2020 election. Therefore, he is suing Twitter in a Virginia state court, seeking to hold the company accountable and putting himself forward to do so, given that he has been the victim of smears, lies, fake accounts, and inaccurate attacks.\n\nNunes concluded by stating that the court system is the only way to solve this problem before 2020, as defamation laws and treating these tech companies as property could set them back. He expressed hope that the courts will step in and that, if he wins one of these cases, it will significantly impact the tech giants.",
    " Title: The New York Times' Article on Hillary Clinton's Gender Vulnerability Faces Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article published on March 8, The New York Times portrayed Hillary Clinton as \"vulnerable\" on the subject of gender, primarily relying on Republican criticisms to question her commitment to women's rights. The criticism centered around the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from Middle Eastern countries with a history of gender discrimination.\n\nThe article noted that \"advancing women has been\" Clinton's \"central life's work,\" but it cited attacks from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the Republican National Committee (RNC), a former White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, and a Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) supporter to highlight the foundation's acceptance of donations from foreign countries with questionable human rights records.\n\nRepublicans, including Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief, and the RNC, have zeroed in on the perceived contradiction between Clinton's public support for women's rights and her acceptance of donations from countries with poor records on gender equality. Fiorina stated, \"Mrs. Clinton tweets about women's rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights.\"\n\nHowever, The New York Times' own report undermines their suggestions about Clinton's questionable track record on women's rights. The article acknowledges that, during Clinton's tenure at the State Department, she emphasized the importance of empowering women and girls to enhance economies, national security, and overall progress.\n\nThroughout her career, Hillary Clinton has consistently championed women's rights and leadership. Despite previous donations to the foundation, Clinton has not ceased from vocally criticizing countries on gender discrimination. During her time as secretary of state, Clinton criticized Saudi Arabia, among other Arab leaders, for discriminating against women, despite the countries' previous donations to the Clinton Foundation.",
    " Title: Congress Stalemate Over Immigration Reform: House Republicans Call for Enhanced Enforcement and Border Security\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress is currently at an impasse over immigration reform, with the House of Representatives rejecting a Senate-passed bill due to concerns about amnesty, increased immigration, and insufficient enforcement, making the bill too costly for American workers. The Republican majority in the House advocates for addressing the issue piecemeal, focusing first on strengthening enforcement and border security.\n\nRecent disclosures by Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher indicate a significant increase in illegal border crossings. In 2013, Border Patrol agents arrested 420,000 individuals, marking the second consecutive year of increases, particularly in South Texas. This revelation has caused disagreement within the Department of Homeland Security, as political appointees have yet to explain this contradiction of their claims that illegal immigration is no longer a significant issue.\n\nInterior enforcement has also seen a decline in the past several years. Leaked internal statistics show that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are making fewer arrests of illegal aliens within the country, and removals from the interior have decreased more than 35% since 2009. Arrests have fallen in every region, with the most significant drops in Georgia and the Carolinas, where 62% fewer illegal aliens were apprehended.\n\nExperts agree that the size of the illegal population has remained relatively stable at approximately 11.5 million over several years, with nearly 900,000 individuals who have been ordered removed but refuse to leave due to a lack of enforcement.\n\nThe Obama administration's claims of \"record\" deportations and \"smarter\" enforcement have been called into question. These claims have been a key talking point for proponents of amnesty and the Senate bill, which sought to weaken enforcement in numerous ways.\n\nInternal documents made public as part of a lawsuit by ICE officers against their own agency reveal that ICE has been inflating deportation numbers by claiming credit for removing tens of thousands of illegal border crossers who were arrested by Border Patrol and held in ICE detention centers for a few hours before being removed. These cases accounted for about half of all deportations in the last two years.\n\nThis practice allows the administration to conceal the decline in interior arrests and create the false impression that they are vigorously enforcing immigration laws. In 2013, ICE encountered more than 700,000 aliens who could have been removed (a record, thanks to new resources from Congress), most of whom were found in jails. However, ICE took action against fewer than 200,000, meaning that ICE is now releasing more illegal aliens\u2014including criminal aliens\u2014than it is arresting.\n\nThis \"smoke and mirrors\" approach is affecting public safety and the rule of law. As ICE fills its limited detention beds with illegal border crossers who could be more efficiently handled by Border Patrol, political leaders in Washington are instructing agents in the field to ignore most illegal aliens living in our communities.\n\nMinor criminals, even chronic re-offenders, reckless or drunk drivers, those with families, those rejected for green cards, anyone claiming to have been brought as a child, and relatives of veterans are all considered off-limits for enforcement. The official rationale for these policies, known as \"prosecutorial discretion,\" is to keep ICE agents focused on removing dangerous criminal aliens rather than \"harmless\" illegal workers.\n\nHowever, the number of criminal removals has also decreased due to the creation of numerous exceptions to the law. In North Carolina alone, authorities have lost track of more than 3,000 illegal alien ex-cons that ICE failed to remove. Inevitably, they will find new victims.\n\nThe Obama administration's deliberate suppression of immigration enforcement has led to a lack of enthusiasm among House Republicans for a comprehensive bill that must be passed to understand its contents. Instead, lawmakers should pass targeted measures to strengthen interior enforcement and restore credibility to the laws we have.\n\nJessica M. Vaughan, the Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based research institute, made these statements.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney: A Paradoxical Figure in the Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who lost the 2012 presidential election, has been described as a paradox due to his political evolution from a moderate Republican to a \"severely conservative\" candidate.\n\nRomney, who would have been the first Mormon president, and his running mate, Catholic Representative Paul Ryan, marked the first presidential ticket in history not to include a Protestant.\n\nIn his home state of Massachusetts, Romney was known as a bipartisan moderate. However, on the national stage, he presented himself as a conservative. Despite his role in creating a healthcare system in Massachusetts that many view as a prototype for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Romney repeatedly vowed to repeal President Barack Obama's version of it.\n\nThe question of whether Romney is a moderate or a conservative can also be applied to the Republican Party, which, according to the article, lacks a clear ideological identity. This lack of clarity may have been the reason the party chose Romney as their nominee.\n\nIn the 2012 elections, the Republican Party faced a dilemma. They needed to appeal to their conservative base while also attracting moderates and independents. Romney was tasked with rebranding the tea party agenda to make it more appealing to the center. However, his speeches were often criticized as flat or goofy, and his attire was seen as uninspiring.\n\nDespite these challenges, Romney's business experience and polished-yet-gentle style were seen as assets in an era of recession. His conservative shift during the primaries, however, was not fully accepted by the conservative movement, leading to losses in Iowa and South Carolina to Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, respectively.\n\nRomney's performance in the debates, particularly the first debate, was praised for its cleverness, humor, energy, and passion. This performance was seen as transformative, helping Romney regain control of the narrative and appeal to both the center and the base.\n\nHowever, the inherent contradictions within Romney and the Republican Party ultimately proved to be their downfall. The electorate was left confused and uncertain about what they were voting for, leading to President Barack Obama's re-election.\n\nThe article concludes by speculating on Romney's future, suggesting he may return to his church and dedicate himself to charity, a reflection of his faith. The article also calls for the conservative movement and pundits to be charitable towards Romney.",
    " Title: Constitutional Amendments in Turkey: Proposed Changes Aim to Promote Inclusivity and Stability\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the referendum on proposed constitutional amendments scheduled for April 16, both the President and Prime Minister are actively campaigning to persuade voters to support the changes. The proposed amendments aim to bring about a more inclusive political system, with the President being required to receive more than 50 percent of the votes, making it difficult for parties to form governments with weak support.\n\nAccording to \u0130smail \u00c7a\u011flar, the director of public and media researches at the Ankara-based think tank, the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA), and an academic at Istanbul Medeniyet University, the new system will force political parties to become more inclusive and appealing to a larger voter base. He stated, \"The parties were able to get a part in the coalition governments, despite their low voter support, but they will now have to form types of coalitions with other parties during the elections at the ballot boxes to become more inclusive and more appealing to a larger voter base.\"\n\nThe supporters of the proposed changes argue that Turkey has long suffered from short-lived governments, with some having an average lifespan of about a year-and-a-half. The changes will abolish the Prime Minister's post and replace it with a stronger system, expected to produce stability and a more effective system of governance in the long term.\n\nPrime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m stated that the proposed changes are not only for the AK Party but are also in favor of all parties that aim to work and serve the people. He added that the new system will eliminate political polarization and make representation more fair and equitable, addressing the needs of Turkey's socio-political dynamics.\n\nA survey by pollsters ANAR puts the \"yes\" votes at 52 percent, while Konsensus puts \"yes\" votes at 51.2 percent after the distribution of undecided voters. The surveys were conducted between April 5 and April 10 in Turkey's 26 provinces and between April 2 and April 8 in 41 provinces, respectively.\n\nPresident Erdo\u011fan, speaking in eastern Turkey's eastern Erzurum province, stated that the new system will allow people to elect their governments without any intermediaries. He added that the state will become the people's state, without any intermediary in between. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m underscored that the new system will force parties to be more inclusive and will reflect all colors of the country as it would need more than 50 percent of all votes to be able to form a government.",
    " Title: Budget Director's Push for Sanctuary Cities Restriction Complicates Government Funding Bill Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, is urging congressional Republicans to include language restricting federal funding for sanctuary cities in a must-pass spending bill, potentially complicating efforts to avoid a government shutdown at the end of April. This move, according to officials from both parties, threatens to disrupt bipartisan negotiations on funding the government.\n\nMulvaney is pressing lawmakers to include language that would restrict federal funding grants for cities that do not enforce federal immigration policies. The goal is to gain the support of the House Freedom Caucus for a government funding bill or to demonstrate that the administration is courting the hard-right and pushing GOP leaders to adopt Trump's priorities.\n\nHowever, this effort by Mulvaney, a former conservative congressman from South Carolina, could jeopardize bipartisan negotiations on funding the government. Democrats have already labeled a request for border wall money as a \"poison pill\" that could lead to a government shutdown. Similarly, an attempt to block liberal cities from receiving federal funds if they ignore immigration guidance would likely cause Democrats to withdraw from negotiations. The budget bill will need Democratic votes to pass, at least eight in the Senate, but probably in the House as well.\n\n\"It would blow up any chance of a bipartisan deal. Getting wall money is hard enough, and you get a guy pushing new riders out of nowhere,\" said a Republican congressional aide. \"I don't see how catering to the Freedom Caucus votes help on [the] spending bill.\"\n\nThe White House has not commented on the matter, referring questions to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nNegotiations between congressional leaders are already delicate. Trump wants $1.4 billion for a border wall and security in the spending bill, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says his caucus will not support it. The Democratic leader reiterated his caucus's stance during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"There are no negotiations \u2014 I met with Mulvaney once,\" Schumer said. \"We hope our Republican colleagues won't insist on things that will cause a government shutdown, but talks are going pretty well right now.\"\n\nIndeed, Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have been making significant progress that could be derailed by Mulvaney's move. McConnell said in an interview on Friday that he had a \"cordial\" meeting with Schumer last week about avoiding a shutdown. Both McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have vowed there will be no shutdown.\n\nSenior Republicans and members of the Appropriations Committee are trying to keep Mulvaney's proposal out of the bill. The fear is that Senate Democrats will filibuster any bill with the sanctuary cities language and put Washington on a path toward a shutdown.\n\nIn the House, a GOP leadership source said the sanctuary cities restriction would repel Democrats and force Ryan to rely on House Freedom Caucus members to pass a funding bill.\n\n\"Of course, that's a nonstarter,\" Matt Dennis, a spokesman for House Appropriations Committee ranking member Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), said of the sanctuary cities idea.\n\nCongress returns in two weeks and will have just five days to avert a shutdown before funding expires on April 28.\n\nBecause of the nation's decentralized process for grant-giving, it's difficult to say how much money would be at stake if Mulvaney's sanctuary cities proposal were adopted. While many grants come directly from a federal agency, more are doled out through state governments or local organizations.\n\nAfter Trump administration officials suggested they would seek to block funding for sanctuary cities in January, Reuters projected that the 10 largest cities, from New York to Washington D.C., would stand to lose $2.27 billion in federal grants. This includes money for Head Start preschool programs, HIV prevention, and airport infrastructure.\n\nCutting off money to sanctuary cities would force lawmakers to make tough decisions about whether to cut off an entire county from funding because a grant recipient technically falls within a sanctuary jurisdiction, according to a March report by the Congressional Research Service.",
    " Title: Exonerated Ricin Suspect Released from Custody, Claims Framing\n\nArticle:\n\nPaul Kevin Curtis, the Elvis impersonator from Corinth, Mississippi, who was accused of mailing poison-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and two other officials, has been released from custody. The charges against him were dropped following the emergence of \"new information,\" according to U.S. Attorney Felicia Adams.\n\nCurtis expressed his relief in an interview with CNN's \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Tuesday, stating, \"It's like a train has been lifted off my shoulders.\" He added, \"I'm overwhelmed. I'm extremely happy to be vindicated and out and able to see my kids.\"\n\nAuthorities are currently investigating whether someone may have attempted to falsely implicate Curtis. A law enforcement source spoke on condition of anonymity about the ongoing investigation.\n\nCurtis was arrested on April 17 and charged with sending a threat to the president after letters containing the poison ricin triggered security scares around Washington. The letters, each with a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, were found to contain the toxin derived from castor beans, which has no known antidote. No illnesses have been reported as a result of exposure to the toxin.\n\nCurtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, stated that her client has been framed by someone who used phrases Curtis often uses on social media. The letters were signed \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"\n\nMcCoy expressed her belief that someone else was responsible for the letters, stating, \"I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him.\" She added, \"It is absolutely horrific that someone would do this.\"\n\nCurtis had been accused of sending letters containing a \"suspicious granular substance\" to President Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi. The FBI confirmed that the substance tested positive for ricin.",
    " Title: Trump's Actions and Statements on the First Amendment and Press Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, President Donald Trump has faced criticism for his statements and actions regarding the First Amendment and press freedom. On Wednesday, Trump expressed displeasure with NBC News for reporting that he had proposed a significant increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In response, he threatened to revoke NBC's broadcast license, a power he does not possess, as broadcast licenses are granted to stations, not networks.\n\nTrump's stance on the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press, has been a subject of concern for many. During his campaign, he vowed to change libel laws to make it easier for public figures to win defamation lawsuits. This position is at odds with a landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision that requires citizens to be able to express their views without fear of being punished for inadvertent misstatements.\n\nThe president's actions and statements have been seen as a threat to press freedom, with his three orders on foreign travelers being particularly controversial. These orders, which some argue stem from his campaign vow to ban all Muslims, have been ruled unconstitutional by judges. The latest order is currently being challenged.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has also faced criticism for his stance on police misconduct. He has spurned a January Justice Department report that found Chicago police guilty of a \"pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force,\" including excessive force and unjustified killings. The Obama administration wanted to prevent these abuses through a consent decree, but Sessions has shown no interest in addressing or acknowledging such issues.\n\nIn a memo rejecting corrective action, Sessions stated, \"It is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies.\" However, when these agencies violate the federal Constitution, it is the responsibility of the federal government to address and rectify the situation.\n\nTrump's comments and actions towards the press have been particularly controversial. During the campaign, he tweeted a doctored video that appeared to show him physically assaulting a CNN representative, inviting violence against reporters. His threat to revoke NBC's broadcast license is another example of his perceived hostility towards the press.\n\nTrump's supporters had initially rallied behind him due to their concerns about potential Supreme Court appointments under a President Hillary Clinton. However, many conservatives now find themselves with a president whose actions and statements on the Constitution and press freedom are at odds with their traditional views.",

He suggested that President Joe Biden may opt for a limited military option in the coming days.\n\nDeMint, a Republican who vacated his Senate seat at the start of the year to lead the conservative Washington think tank, the Heritage Foundation, criticized the Biden administration for being too passive in addressing the conflict in Syria. DeMint stated that the president needs to make it clear what the U.S. will do, and that his indecisiveness has destabilized the situation and possibly led Israel into the conflict.\n\nDeMint's reference to a \"red line\" has become a contentious issue for the White House. In August, President Obama suggested that the use of chemical weapons would cross a threshold, or \"red line,\" that could change his stance on American intervention in Syria's civil war. Since then, critics have accused the Obama administration of staking out an unclear position on potential U.S. military involvement in the conflict.\n\nRichardson suggested that increasing signs that the British and French governments could arm the Syrian rebels could pave the way for some kind of American intervention. However, DeMint argued that Syria is \"almost a distraction\" because the \"issue here is Iran\" and the weapons it may be distributing to Israel's enemies. DeMint stated that the U.S. should focus on demonstrating support for Israel and continuing pressure on Iran to avoid creating more problems inside Syria.",
    " Title: Romney's CEO Core: A Distinct Identity Beyond Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the highly partisan political landscape, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has been criticized for perceived changes in his political positions. However, a closer examination of Romney's career reveals a distinct identity rooted in his experience as a CEO rather than a politician.\n\nRomney's success as a businessman is not measured by adherence to ideology but by the effectiveness of his ability to sell a product. This approach is evident in Romney's political career, where he modifies his messages to appeal to the target audience at any given time.\n\nRomney's evolving political positions are not sudden or unexpected, but rather calculated adjustments to his \"product line\" to attract the most customers based on the current marketplace conditions. This strategy is reminiscent of the adage, \"The customer is always right.\"\n\nFor instance, Romney's stance on the individual mandate, a key issue in the ongoing healthcare debate, has shifted from supporting it during his tenure as Massachusetts governor to labeling it a tax in his 2012 presidential campaign. Similarly, Romney's views on abortion and gun control have evolved to align with the preferences of conservative voters.\n\nRomney's ability to adapt his political positions to appeal to different demographics has led some to question his authenticity. However, this strategy could potentially result in a pragmatic president who is not rigidly bound by ideology but rather focused on finding practical solutions.\n\nIn contrast, others, like myself, may find Romney's CEO core and ever-evolving product line cause doubt about every word he says. This ambivalence underscores the importance of thorough research and critical thinking when evaluating political candidates.",

Business owners reported incidents of smashed windows, graffiti, stolen property, and arson. Some stores have reopened with plywood covering their damaged windows, displaying signs that read \"Open for Business.\"\n\nOne such business, \"Yolo! Botique,\" has a sign that reads \"OPEN!\" and instructs would-be looters that the store is \"BLACK OWNED.\" Sonny Dayan, a small business owner of a cell phone store in a small strip mall on West Florrissant Avenue in Ferguson, MO, shared his experiences with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday. Dayan's store, like others in the area, is boarded up with hand-made signs indicating they are still open.\n\nA medical facility owner also shared her concerns with \u2588\u2588\u2588, stating that patients are canceling appointments due to fear of the unrest in the area. The owner, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution from protesters, reported a loss of about 70% of her business over the past week. She added that the damages may not be covered by insurance due to potential exclusions for riot-related incidents.\n\nDayan and the medical facility owner expressed concerns about the potential denial of insurance coverage for damages related to the riots, with Dayan stating, \"I have the best insurance, but I heard rumors they may try to play the social unrest card and say that I'm not covered and say that this is a civil unrest and therefore I'm not covered.\" The medical facility owner echoed these concerns, stating, \"Several of these businesses and we checked ours - there's a cause in it that says there's no coverage for anything pertaining to a riot act.\"\n\nBoth business owners lamented the additional challenges they face as small business owners in the midst of the ongoing unrest, with the medical facility owner stating, \"So it's not enough that we've suffered for nine days and lost about 70 percent of the business and can't pay our rent and can't get anybody here to help us. So what else can we observe here as small business owners?\"",

Ty Cobb, the President's attorney, made this statement on Sunday night.\n\nThe statement comes after a series of tweets from President Trump about Mueller and the President's personal lawyer calling for an end to the probe. On Saturday, Trump tweeted, \"The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife\u2019s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\"\n\nIn another tweet on the same day, Trump wrote, \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\"\n\nTrump's messages came hours after John Dowd, one of the President's personal lawyers, issued a statement reacting to the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Dowd's statement read, \"I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.\"\n\nHowever, Dowd later clarified that he was not speaking on behalf of the White House. Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also schooled Dowd over his statement, saying, \"I think the president's attorney frankly does him a disservice when he says that. If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.\"\n\nA number of lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle also warned Trump not to call for Mueller's firing, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that if Trump \u201c tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\"",

Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio, stated that no person will be asked proactively if they attended a protest. However, if an individual chooses to proactively disclose their participation in a protest, there is an opportunity for them to do so.\n\nDe Blasio, who announced his program last month to hire 1,000 \"contact tracers,\" has promised to reveal on Monday how many city residents have been questioned so far. The tracers are supposed to ask those who test positive for Covid-19 to \"recall 'contacts' and individuals they may have exposed.\" Tracers also probe for any \"close contacts\" of the patient\u2014anyone that has been within six feet of the infected person for at least 10 minutes.\n\nNew York City officials have taken a soft stance over fears that mass protests could lead to a spike in coronavirus cases. Mark Levine, head of the city council's health committee, tweeted earlier this month, \"Let's be clear about something: if there is a spike in coronavirus cases in the next two weeks, don't blame the protesters. Blame racism.\"\n\nThe mayor, whose daughter was arrested during a Manhattan protest over the death of George Floyd, is facing a lawsuit for allegedly violating the constitutional rights of religious New Yorkers by placing restrictions on religious services. However, De Blasio has pushed back on claims that he has been hypocritical in allowing protests to proceed while keeping religious services shuttered.\n\n\"When you see...an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seated in 400 years of American racism, I'm sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services,\" de Blasio said in a press conference earlier this month.",
    " Title: Abortion Debate Erupts in Coronavirus Relief Bill Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nAs lawmakers approached a deal on a coronavirus rescue package that would include paid sick leave and free virus testing, a few roadblocks emerged. Among them was the attempt by some Republicans to insert anti-choice restrictions into the House's relief bill, turning\u2014if temporarily\u2014a public health crisis into an abortion debate.\n\nThe tensions reportedly revolved around the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old provision that blocks federal funds from going to abortion services, preventing millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid from accessing abortion care. According to conservative media, some top Republicans believed a stipulation in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories doing coronavirus testing could effectively overturn the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions. In response, anti-choice lawmakers insisted on including language in the legislation that would reaffirm the principles of the amendment.\n\nWhen Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday that negotiations over the coronavirus response bill would go into next week, he accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of turning the legislation into an \u201cideological wish list.\u201d\n\n\"Instead of focusing on immediate relief to affected individuals, families, and businesses, the House Democrats chose to wander into various areas of policy that are barely related if at all to the issue before us,\" McConnell said.\n\nHowever, it is often Republicans who use unrelated legislation as a vehicle for their anti-abortion agenda. And it's not the first time they've used legislation tied to public health emergencies to do so. Amid the spread of the Zika virus in 2016, anti-choice lawmakers added a caveat blocking Planned Parenthood health care providers from accessing any of the designated emergency funds.\n\nConservative lawmakers also tried to wedge a sneaky anti-abortion provision into Trump's 2017 tax plan, giving expectant parents the option of creating a college savings account before their child is even born. The measure included fetal personhood language, referring to fetuses as \"unborn children,\" and defining \"unborn child\" as any \"child in utero.\"\n\nAbortion restrictions have been a sticking point in spending bills, which both parties use to push for policies they're having trouble advancing by other means. In 2018, the White House pushed Republicans in Congress to slip measures that threatened to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood into a bill to prevent the third government shutdown of the year\u2014even though government dollars never went to funding abortion services at the clinics because of the Hyde Amendment. A little less than a year later, Democrats used their new House majority to pass a spending bill that challenged one of the Trump administration's most wide-reaching abortion restrictions: the global gag rule, a law that bans U.S. funding from going to international organizations that provide abortion services or even discuss abortion as a form of reproductive health care. (This version of the spending bill did not make it past Senate Republicans.)\n\nWhile government shutdowns can, at a point, become national emergencies, none so far has compared to the scale of the current global coronavirus pandemic, which could leave the U.S. worse off than countries like Italy\u2014which put a quarter of its population on emergency quarantine\u2014the longer it delays decisive action.\n\nThe unemployment benefits and free testing that are at the core of the coronavirus rescue package aim to prevent further spread of the virus and to make sure that low-wage workers can afford to pay for food, rent, and other necessities if they get sick, or if their workplaces shutter to mitigate harm, or as a result of government mandates. Neither of those things has to do with abortion\u2014they're urgent health matters that require the fastest possible response from elected officials.",
    " Title: E.W. Jackson, Virginia's Republican Lieutenant Governor Nominee, Compares Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan\n\nArticle:\n\nE.W. Jackson, the newly minted Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of Virginia, has made controversial statements in the past, including comparing Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan and criticizing the \"slavish devotion\" of black voters to the Democratic Party.\n\nIn a four-minute video posted on YouTube last fall, Jackson urged African-Americans to vote Republican and accused the \"civil rights establishment\" of selling out their Christian values to support Democratic policy positions on gay marriage and abortion.\n\n\"The Democrat Party has created an unholy alliance between certain so-called civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, which has killed unborn black babies by the tens of millions,\" Jackson said in the video.\n\nOn the website of an advocacy group founded by Jackson, Staying True to America's National Destiny, abortion is described as \"the equivalent of an idolatrous offering to the god of'sexual license.'\" The website further compares abortion to pagan practices of offering babies as sacrifices.\n\nThe emergence of Jackson as a standard-bearer for the Republican Party could have implications beyond the race for lieutenant governor. Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli has sought to keep his campaign message focused on jobs and economic concerns, while Democrats have assailed him for his staunchly conservative record on abortion and gay rights. The selection of Jackson for the GOP ticket may help keep social issues in the foreground of the 2013 debate.\n\nThe comments about Planned Parenthood in particular are incendiary. The abortion rights-supporting group ran web ads against Cuccinelli only this last week, and the Democratic Party of Virginia produced a wave of robo-calls accusing the state attorney general of \"pursuing an ideological tea party agenda that bans abortion.\"\n\nA Jackson adviser did not respond to emails seeking comment. Republican Party of Virginia spokesman Garren Shipley defended the candidate as a person of faith and predicted the 2013 elections would not hinge on social issues.\n\n\"It is no secret that E.W. Jackson has deeply held Christian conservative beliefs,\" Shipley said in an email. \"But the race for lieutenant governor will be fought on economic ground as opposed to social policy. In the weeks and months ahead, Jackson will focus on ideas that produce more quality jobs for Virginians and make life easier for families and workers.\"",
    " Title: Julie Swetnick Describes Kavanaugh as \"Mean Drunk\" in NBC Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nJulie Swetnick, the third woman to accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, described him as a \"mean drunk\" who pushed \"girls against walls\" during her first televised interview with NBC News' Kate Snow. In the interview that aired Monday night on MSNBC, Swetnick also called Kavanaugh a \"liar\" for dismissing her allegations against him.\n\nSwetnick, in a sworn statement signed under penalty of perjury and released last week through her attorney, Michael Avenatti, alleged Kavanaugh preyed on young women. In Monday's interview, Swetnick did not accuse Kavanaugh of assaulting her.\n\nDuring the interview, Swetnick strayed at times from her sworn statement, admitting she did not know if Kavanaugh and his friend at the time, Mark Judge, would \"spike\" the punch at house parties in the early 1980s \"so as to cause girls to lose their inhibitions and their ability to say 'no,'\" an explosive allegation made in her three-page statement.\n\n\"He was very aggressive. Very sloppy drunk. A mean drunk. I saw him go up to girls and paw on them and try to, you know, get a little too handsy touching them on private parts. I saw him try to shift clothing,\" Swetnick said during the television interview. \"I saw him push girls against walls. He would pretend to stumble and stumble into them and knock them against walls. He would push his body against hers.\"\n\nKavanaugh has labeled Swetnick's allegations as \"ridiculous\" and \"from the Twilight Zone.\" During the interview, Snow played a portion of Kavanaugh's hearing from last week for Swetnick during which he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that there was no truth to the allegations made against him by Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Swetnick.\n\nAfter hearing his statement, Swetnick shook her head and said, \"He's a liar.\"\n\nNBC News could not confirm Swetnick\u2019s allegations. Of the four people she named attending the parties, one said he didn\u2019t recall, another was dead, and two others didn\u2019t respond.\n\nTwo days before he released Swetnick's name and sworn statement, Avenatti told reporters in Los Angeles that his client had multiple witnesses to corroborate her story and called her \"100 percent credible.\"\n\nIn her sworn statement, Swetnick, 55, alleged Kavanaugh was among a group of boys who would doctor the punch at parties to \"cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in a side room or bedroom by a 'train' of numerous boys.\"\n\nWhen asked by Snow if she had witnessed Kavanaugh spike drinks, however, Swetnick said only that she saw him \"around the punch containers\" and had seen him \"giving red cups to quite a few girls during that time frame.\"\n\n\"I do not know what he did,\" she added. \"But I saw him by them, yes.\"\n\nIn her written statement, Swetnick said she had \"a firm recollection of seeing boys\" \u2014 including Kavanaugh \u2014 \"lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their 'turn' with a girl inside the room.\"\n\nBut, in her interview with Snow, Swetnick said the boys were not \"lined up\" but \"huddled by the doors.\"\n\nAt the party in which she said she was sexually assaulted \u2014 \"My body was violated. My soul was broken,\" she told Snow \u2014 Swetnick said she could not single out Kavanaugh as one of her attackers.\n\n\"I can not specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me,\" Swetnick said.\n\nSwetnick said she told her mother and reported the incident to Montgomery County police. Her mother and the police officer who took the report are both dead, and the department told NBC News it could take weeks to retrieve records about the incident.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has remained supportive of his Supreme Court pick, telling reporters on Monday that he believed the ongoing FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's background would be \"a good thing.\" Also Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the full Senate would vote on Kavanaugh's nomination this week.",
    " Title: Senate Advances Immigration Reform Bill, Faces Contentious Amendment Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate successfully overcame a filibuster on Tuesday, moving the long-stalled immigration reform bill to the chamber floor for further debate. This marks the first time since 2007 that the comprehensive immigration issue has been before Congress, with lawmakers anticipating numerous hurdles ahead.\n\nWithin the first two hours of debate, 44 amendments were filed to the 1,075-page bill. These amendments cover a range of topics, including social issues such as granting immigration benefits to same-sex partners of American citizens and requiring illegal immigrants to wait until the borders are deemed secure before obtaining legal status.\n\nOther amendments address more technical aspects of the bill, such as setting the level for guest-workers, determining whether to make English the official language of the U.S., and proposals for border security measures.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, will play a significant role in determining which amendments will be allowed for a vote. He has warned that he will allow some latitude but will have little patience for those he believes are trying to undermine the bill rather than sincerely improving it.\n\nThe bill, as it stands, cannot pass the chamber, according to Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and part of the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" that negotiated the deal. Rubio has stated that the legislation needs stiffer border security, better checks of visitors entering and leaving the country, and more stringent English-language requirements.\n\nUnder the bill, illegal immigrants who eventually apply for permanent residency must demonstrate that they understand English or have enrolled in classes to learn the language. Sen. Rubio has indicated that he will offer an amendment to strike the option of enrolling in classes, requiring anyone seeking full legal residency to prove that they understand English.\n\nSen. James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, has introduced amendments that would allow businesses to implement English-only policies in their workplaces and designate English as the official language of the U.S. These amendments were contentious during the 2006 and 2007 immigration reform debates.\n\nThe 82-15 vote on Tuesday to head off a filibuster signifies a promising start for this year's debate. In a similar vote in 2007, supporters received only 69 votes. The difference this year is that more Republicans are eager to at least hold the debate, with many feeling that their political futures depend on reaching out to Hispanic voters who view the immigration issue as a litmus test.\n\nThe focus will now be on approximately 20 Republicans who voted to begin the debate but are likely to want to see major changes before they support the final product. One of these Republicans is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who stated that the legislation has \"serious flaws.\"\n\nMcConnell seems to accept the legalization of illegal immigrants, but his concerns lie primarily with how the bill handles border security and the taxpayer benefits that newly legalized illegal immigrants may be eligible for, such as tax credits.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, has proposed an amendment to require the border to be secured before illegal immigrants can gain initial legal status. Another contentious amendment comes from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, who aims to grant immigration benefits to partners in states that perform same-sex marriages.\n\nCatholic and Evangelical leaders supporting the immigration bill have warned they could withdraw their support over the gay-rights issue. Offering the amendment on the floor may provide Sen. Leahy with an opportunity to take a stand without fear of derailing the full bill, as it is unlikely to achieve the 60 votes needed to add it to the bill.",
    " Title: Democrats' Memo on FBI and DOJ's Use of Trump-Russia Dossier Omission of Key Facts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have been accused of omitting several key facts from their memo regarding the FBI and Department of Justice's (DOJ) use of the Trump-Russia dossier in obtaining a spy warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in 2016.\n\nThe Democrats' memo, released on Saturday, aimed to refute a similar memo released on Feb. 2 by committee Republicans, who alleged that the FBI and DOJ had abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) system in obtaining the warrant. However, the Democratic memo overlooked several significant points, as outlined in the Republican rebuttal.\n\nOne of the key omissions involves the testimony of former FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe. In December, McCabe testified that the FISA warrant would not have been sought without the infamous dossier, which was commissioned by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). This testimony was a crucial point in the Republican memo, but it was not directly addressed or refuted in the Democratic memo.\n\nRepublicans also noted that the Democratic memo failed to acknowledge that the DNC and Clinton campaign funded the dossier, a fact that, according to the Graham-Grassley referral, formed \"a significant portion of the Carter Page FISA application.\" The Democratic memo also did not contain a single reference to the DNC or Clinton campaign, or admit that this information was not provided to the FISA Court.\n\nAnother omission involves a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which was part of the FISA application. While the Democratic memo confirmed that the article was part of the FISA application, it ignored the fact that the FBI failed to subsequently inform the Court that Steele provided information to Yahoo News. Isikoff has publicly confirmed Steele was a source for his article about Page.\n\nLastly, the Republicans claim the Democratic memo presents an incomplete picture of Page's past activities and omits that, in a secretly-taped statement reproduced in a 2015 federal court filing, a Russian intelligence officer called Page \"an idiot.\"\n\nThis development adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing investigation and debate surrounding the use of the Trump-Russia dossier in the FISA warrant application process.",
    " Title: Gas Prices Drop Below $1.42 in Some U.S. Areas: AAA and GasBuddy Predict Prices Below $2 Nationwide\n\nArticle:\n\nGasoline prices in several gas stations across the United States have dropped below $1.42 per gallon, with AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that track gasoline prices, predicting that prices below $2 will become common in most of the country. The price of gas could even reach $1 per gallon in some areas, a level last seen in 1999.\n\nThe primary factors influencing gasoline prices are oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity, and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have fallen below $33 per barrel and are continuing to decline. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to maintain high oil exports has effectively dismantled the OPEC cartel, leading to an oil supply glut. Slowing national economies in major countries, including China, are expected to lower demand. China is now the world's largest oil importer, according to the Financial Times, surpassing the United States.\n\nThe cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is higher than the sale price in some cases. However, parts of the industry continue to pump oil, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt due to low crude prices.\n\nSeveral states host large refineries or are near those that do, particularly those near the Gulf of Mexico, including refinery operations south of Houston, which are partly owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM). Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, especially when refineries are running at or near capacity and producing gasoline instead of other petroleum products.\n\nFinally, gas taxes in several states are below the national average of $0.4869 per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570, and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states further compound the effect of falling oil prices.\n\nWith gas prices already close to $1.40 in some areas and continuing to drop, the odds grow each day that gas prices will reach $1 per gallon in some parts of the United States.",
    " Title: President Obama Naturalizes 25 Active-Duty Service Members, Advocates for Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama began his Fourth of July celebration on Wednesday by naturalizing 25 active-duty service members in the East Room of the White House. The event served as a platform for the President to highlight his recent executive order sparing hundreds of thousands from deportation and to urge lawmakers to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul.\n\nFollowing the naturalization ceremony, Homeland Security Secretary Janet A. Napolitano administered the oath of allegiance. Mr. Obama then congratulated the new citizens and their families, stating, \"What a perfect way to celebrate America\u2019s birthday - the world\u2019s oldest democracy - with some of our newest citizens.\"\n\nThe President expressed his personal pride in welcoming the group of service members as fellow citizens, as they chose to serve a country that was not yet their own during a time of war. He emphasized the role each generation has played in building and shaping the country, and called on Congress to pass the Dream Act, which would grant citizenship to certain illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children and maintain good moral standing.\n\nMr. Obama also called for a comprehensive overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws, stating, \"For just as we remain a nation of laws, we have to remain a nation of immigrants.\" He reiterated his recent executive action, which potentially allows more than 800,000 young people to remain in the U.S. without the risk of deportation.\n\nThe politically charged decision comes as Mr. Obama faces a tough re-election fight against likely Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with Hispanic voters in swing states playing a critical role in determining the next occupant of the Oval Office. Mr. Romney has stated he would veto the Dream Act and favors a path to citizenship only for illegal immigrant young adults who join the military.\n\nIn response to the Obama announcement, Mr. Romney stated that the move could make it harder to find a long-term fix to the immigration issue. Since then, Mr. Romney has been vague about his position, but he recently told supporters in a private meeting that he would not modify his hard-line immigration stance and opposition to amnesty, according to a report earlier this week in Politico.\n\nThe Dream Act last came before Congress in 2010 when it was defeated on a bipartisan filibuster. Democrats have introduced their own legislation again this year, and have called for the GOP to work with them. Mr. Romney has enlisted the campaign trail help of Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and rising star in the GOP who is working on his own version of a Dream Act.\n\nThe President and the first family planned to spend the afternoon and evening with military families at a USO concert on the White House\u2019s South Lawn featuring country music star Brad Paisley and the Marine Corps Band. Mr. Obama will embark on a two-day \"Betting on America\" tour on Thursday, visiting several northern Ohio communities that were instrumental to his 2008 win in the state and then onto Pennsylvania, another state he previously won, for an event in Pittsburgh.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Romney, who has been campaigning nearly nonstop since the end of primaries in the spring, was planning to spend the entire week with his family at their lakeside home in Wolfeboro, N.H., where he has been seen aboard a personal watercraft with his wife, playing volleyball with his five sons, and taking his grandchildren out for ice cream. While he may be technically on vacation, Mr. Romney is still staying focused on November. Mr. Romney huddled with campaign advisers Wednesday, as well as the aide overseeing his vice-presidential search. He made his first official public appearance of the week marching in Wolfeboro\u2019s July Fourth parade, shaking hands and speaking from the bed of a pickup truck.",
    " Title: Fed's Potential September Wind-Down of Asset Purchases Could Impact Economic Recovery and 2016 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve's continued plans to wind down its asset purchases, following a better-than-expected jobs report in June, could potentially have significant implications for the U.S. economy and the 2014 midterm and 2016 general elections. The Labor Department's report showed a gain of 195,000 jobs in June, a sign of a modest, ongoing economic recovery. However, this could prompt the Fed to start winding down its extraordinary measures to boost the economy as early as September.\n\nThe jobs report, which initially led to a rise in stocks, also caused the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to spike over 2.7 percent, the highest level since 2011. This increase indicates that investors are concerned the strong hiring numbers could lead the Fed to act more aggressively.\n\nThe Fed, under Chairman Ben Bernanke, has played a significant role in U.S. economic policy in recent years, filling the gap left by a polarized political process in Washington. The central bank has kept its target for short-term interest rates at effectively zero and expanded its balance sheet by purchasing large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage debt. This has boosted home and auto spending, driving much of the economic recovery.\n\nHowever, the traditional drivers of long-term growth, such as business investment and higher wages, are largely absent. Friday's jobs report showed wages rising by 10 cents to $24.01, with hourly earnings up 2.2 percent over the year. The jobs being created are not high-wage positions, with the leisure, hospitality, and retail industries accounting for 112,000 of the jobs created in June. Professional and business services added just 53,000.\n\nThe average workweek remained unchanged at 34.5 hours, suggesting employers do not see a need to increase production. The number of workers who want full-time jobs but were only employed part-time surged by 322,000 to 8.2 million. Some attribute this increase to employers avoiding hiring full-time workers to avoid the mandate to provide coverage under President Barack Obama's health reform law. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.6 percent.\n\nDespite these factors, the Fed still appears to be planning to start winding down its asset purchases as early as September, a precursor to eventually increasing interest rates. If the Fed acts too quickly and the economy is not ready, economists warn it could lead to soaring interest rates and a potential return to recession. This could impact the 2014 midterms and make the 2016 presidential election environment less favorable for Democrats.",
    " Title: Impact of Wisconsin's Anti-Union Law on Public Employee Unions and Wages\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Washington Post recently revisited Wisconsin, four years after the implementation of a controversial public employee union law. The law, which significantly restricted collective bargaining rights and union dues collection, has led to a significant decline in union membership and public employee numbers in the state.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, membership in the Wisconsin affiliate of the National Education Association is down one-third, the American Federation of Teachers dropped by half, and the state employees union fell 70 percent. The ratio of public employees to total population is at its lowest level in at least two decades, and overall union membership in Wisconsin has fallen to 11.7 percent, down from 16 percent 10 years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe decline in union membership has also led to a decrease in public employees, contradicting Governor Scott Walker's claim that the passage of the anti-union law would save jobs. The Wisconsin Budget Project finds that the state's median household income is $51,467 a year, nearly $800 below the national average. This income has fallen consistently since the passage of the anti-union law in 2011, despite a small bounce-back nationally in 2013.\n\nThe erosion of public unions in Wisconsin may have significant implications for take-home pay. According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, public employees lost the equivalent of 8-10 percent in take-home pay due to increased contributions to healthcare and pension benefits. Moreover, the meager earnings growth that has come to Wisconsin has mostly gone to the top 1 percent of earners.\n\nThe trends in Wisconsin mirror those in the country at large, where labor has similarly struggled. Real hourly wages fell for almost everyone nationwide in 2014, according to the Economic Policy Institute, except for the low-wage sector, bolstered by minimum wage increases at the state and local level. Wisconsin has not joined that movement, with its minimum wage still consistent with the federal floor, at $7.25 an hour.\n\nWhile the causal relationship between the anti-union law and income stagnation in Wisconsin is not definitive, the erosion of collective bargaining is often cited as a significant factor in wage growth for middle-wage workers over the last few decades. The example of Wisconsin provides a salient example of this phenomenon.\n\nCollective worker action has been behind significant wage announcements, such as Wal-Mart's move to increase entry-level pay to $9 an hour this year and $10 an hour by 2016. This wage increase is expected to have a ripple effect on the retail sector, pushing up the wage floor. The United Food and Commercial Workers' campaign to organize Wal-Mart workers is credited with this development.\n\nScott Walker's anti-union policy has effectively silenced the voice of public unions and the entire Wisconsin labor movement, leaving them crippled. This has real consequences for middle-class wages. Since Walker wants to bring this policy to the rest of the country in 2016, people on Main Streets outside of Wisconsin should take note.",
    " Title: Trump's Unconventional Approach to Foreign Policy Faces Criticism in Syria Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's unconventional language and approach to foreign policy has long been a subject of debate, with critics labeling it as unbecoming and ineffective, while supporters argue that his blunt style is more forceful and effective than traditional diplomatic language. However, the recent crisis in Syria has raised questions about the efficacy of Trump's approach.\n\nIn the Syrian conflict, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, a NATO member, dismissed a strongly-worded missive from Trump, the U.S. President, reportedly even throwing the letter in the trash. This incident, according to the BBC, is a vivid illustration of the declining respect for Washington and American leadership worldwide.\n\nDaniel Nexon, a political scientist, has described Trump as a \"paper tiger,\" suggesting that his influence is perceived as weak. One argument for Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from northern Syria is that Turkey was determined to invade regardless, and the president acted to protect U.S. soldiers from harm. However, this argument is questionable, as Trump had successfully held off Erdo\u011fan for two years prior.\n\nIf Trump's decision was indeed motivated by a desire to protect U.S. troops, he wasted a week of precious time. Erdo\u011fan launched the invasion without heeding Trump's warnings. When the president implemented the sanctions he had threatened, it had no discernible impact on Erdo\u011fan. American troops were fired upon during the chaotic withdrawal, and American planes are now bombing U.S. munitions dumps to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Independent observers have reported atrocities in the fighting.\n\nCurrently, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are in Ankara attempting traditional diplomacy. However, if Erdo\u011fan maintains his stance, it could demonstrate the lack of respect for American leadership overseas. If Pence and Pompeo succeed, it could indicate the failure of Trump's personal approach. Trump, seemingly unconcerned, has stated, \"They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand that they can play with.\" It is hard to believe that world leaders do not place more value in his words.",

Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, who is running for re-election in a U.S. Senate seat, apologized for a comment she made about attending a public hanging during a debate against her opponent, Mike Espy, on Tuesday night. The comment was captured in a video that went viral on Sunday.\n\nAt a Nov. 2 event, Hyde-Smith, alongside cattle rancher Colin Hutchinson, a supporter, said, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" The supporters around them laughed. The exchange was captured in a video and tweeted by Lamar White Jr.\n\nDuring the debate, when asked if she was willing to apologize, Hyde-Smith said, \"For anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements.\"\n\nHyde-Smith is in a runoff on Nov. 27th against Mike Espy. She also used another phrase at the event, stating she would fight a circle saw for Hutchinson. \"Obviously, I would not stick my arm in a circle saw,\" she said.\n\nAfter apologizing, Hyde-Smith went on to say her words were later used by the Espy campaign for \"political gain.\" Espy, in a rebuttal, said, \"No one twisted your comments, because the comments came out of your mouth.\" He added that the video went viral \"around the world\" in just three minutes. Espy concluded, \"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we know what came out of your mouth.\"",
    " Title: Guest Writer Ponders Removing Conservative Grandparents from Children's Lives Due to Political and Social Differences\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The Huffington Post, Hannah Selinger, a contributor to the publication, expressed her contemplation of removing her conservative Republican in-laws from her children's lives due to their political beliefs and perceived offensive behaviors. The article, titled \"It Might Be Time to Cut My Right-Wing, Trump-Loving In-Laws Out of My Kids' Lives,\" did not portray a picture of tolerance and family unity overcoming political ideologies.\n\nSelinger outlined several instances of her in-laws' allegedly intolerant and problematic behaviors, including their support for President Donald Trump, their pro-life views on abortion, and their perceived indifference towards the treatment of migrant children at the U.S. border. Selinger also accused her in-laws of exhibiting intolerance towards marginalized groups, citing instances of homophobia, racism, and sexism.\n\nOne of Selinger's key complaints was her in-laws' perceived lack of empathy and understanding towards people who are not white, straight, or \"American.\" For example, her father-in-law reportedly showed disdain when a black character in the movie \"Moonlight\" arrived in a fancy car, and her mother-in-law allegedly showed little concern for the death of Heather Heyer during the Charlottesville, Virginia, riots.\n\nSelinger also expressed frustration with her in-laws' consumption of right-wing cable news and their apparent unwillingness to engage in conversations about race and politics. She claimed that her in-laws' political ideologies were negatively impacting her children, and that she had reached out to her mother-in-law to discuss the impact of the Charlottesville riots but received a dismissive response.\n\nSelinger's husband reportedly feels disappointment in his mother but is hesitant to cut his parents out of their lives, while Selinger is more inclined to do so. Selinger concluded the article by stating that she and her husband are currently putting off making a decision about the future of their relationship with her in-laws, but they are certain about two things: they want to do what is best for their children, and they are unsure about what that might be. Selinger expressed a desire to protect her children from bigotry and ensure that they grow up to be good people.",
    " Title: Trump's First Year in Office: A Mixed Bag of Character, Policies, and Associates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, concerns about Donald Trump's character, associates, and policies were raised by many, including the author. These concerns proved to be well-founded as the new president took advice from individuals like Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn during his first term.\n\nTrump's campaign was ideologically incoherent, casting doubt on NATO alliances, advocating withdrawal from Afghanistan, arguing for U.S. forces to commit war crimes, promoting an economically ruinous form of protectionism, and promoting a starry-eyed view of Vladimir Putin that was at odds with reality and American interests.\n\nHowever, fast-forwarding to the present, Flynn has been ousted, Bannon is no longer in the White House, and the NATO alliances remain firm. Missile-defense batteries have been deployed to South Korea, and the U.S. has reinforced Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The caliphate of ISIS has been defeated in conventional combat without resorting to war crimes. Trump's first major legislative victory was a Republican tax plan that delivers on long-desired hopes for cuts in corporate rates. Obamacare's individual mandate is effectively gone, and judicial nominations are heavily influenced by the conservative Federalist Society.\n\nWhile there have been Trumpian flourishes in foreign policy, some of them have been positive. For instance, Trump is the one who formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and pulled the United States from the Paris climate accords.\n\nHowever, the Bannon wing of the Trump movement has demonstrated that it possesses the reverse Midas Touch: Everything it touches turns to lead. Trump pursued Bannon's strategy in rushing out the first version of his so-called \"travel ban,\" resulting in a political disaster. Trump followed Bannon's advice in responding to the horror and evil in Charlottesville with equivocations, leading to the low point of his presidency so far. Bannon was ushered out of the White House and played a key role in losing Republicans a previously guaranteed Senate seat.\n\nIn short, if there is a GOP civil war, conservatives are winning it. A better tax structure has a chance to extend and amplify America's ongoing economic recovery. Better judges can safeguard core American civil liberties and preserve America's constitutional order. A strong and sensible foreign policy can ease the catastrophic refugee crisis of the Obama era and preserve a global system that has prevented great-power conflict for an impressively long time.\n\nAs we approach 2018 and the midterm elections, advisers and policies will only carry us so far. The matter of character remains a significant concern, and if character is indeed destiny, then the GOP may need to prepare for a defeat.",
    " Title: Barclays Scandal and Political Donations: Romney and Obama Receive Funds from Bank Under Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn late June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to resolve accusations of rate manipulation. Following this, Robert Diamond, the bank's CEO, resigned from his position. Recently, 11 members of Parliament signed a resolution, naming former U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney, urging Barclays executives to cease political fundraising and focus on rebuilding consumer confidence in the banking system.\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, Barclays was the ninth-biggest source of contributions to Mr. Romney's campaign or his joint fundraising effort with the Republican National Committee, with employees contributing $234,650 through May. However, Democrats may be hesitant to draw attention to Mr. Romney's donations from big banks like Barclays, as employees of the bank have contributed $34,800 to President Barack Obama and his joint effort with the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThis month, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. attended a fundraiser in Park City, Utah, co-hosted by Mark Gilbert, a top executive at Barclays, who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Mr. Obama's re-election bid. Representatives of the Romney and Obama campaigns declined to comment.\n\nBesides Barclays, executives at several banks under investigation, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse, are co-chairmen for the Romney fundraisers in London. Mr. Romney, who ran the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, plans to attend the opening ceremonies for the 2012 Games next Friday.\n\nThe ties to the firms under investigation could detract from a trip intended to highlight Mr. Romney's history with the Olympics. Additionally, it may provide ammunition to his left-wing critics, as Mr. Romney has been vocal against Wall Street regulation, such as the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nDespite the controversy, the co-host of one fundraiser, Karl Dasher, said there was \"strong excitement\" for Romney among expatriates in London. Republican fundraisers described the London receptions as a case of awkward timing, noting that scrutiny of presidential donors always intensifies when a company is under investigation.\n\nAlfred Hoffman Jr., a Florida developer who is a top Republican fundraiser but is not raising money for the Romney campaign, stated, \"You want to make sure that you don't wind up with egg on your face because you got some money from some guy who pulled a stunt. But you can't screen everybody that writes your check. You do the best you can\u2014you make sure that they're an American citizen.\"",
    " Title: Iranian General Qassem Soleimani Killed in U.S. Airstrike, Funeral Procession Results in Casualties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force and a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, was killed in a U.S. airstrike near Baghdad International Airport on Friday. The strike was in response to Soleimani's alleged involvement in planning attacks on U.S. personnel.\n\nAccording to reports, Soleimani's burial was postponed after as many as 40 people were killed and more than 200 were injured during a crush in his hometown of Kerman. This information was reported by Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency, as noted by NBC News on Tuesday.\n\nSoleimani was reportedly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans during the Iraq War, with 17% of all deaths of U.S. personnel in Iraq from 2003 to 2011 attributed to him, according to the State Department. The department also stated that Soleimani had been coordinating further imminent large-scale attacks against U.S. diplomats and service members in the past several days.\n\nIn a statement, the Defense Department stated that Soleimani was \"actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\" The statement also noted that Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted on Friday that Soleimani had killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period and was plotting to kill many more. Trump also stated that Soleimani was responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of protesters killed in Iran itself.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei openly cried over Soleimani's death during the general's state-organized funeral on Monday. Khamenei, who worked closely with Soleimani for decades, uttered an emotional prayer during the funeral. The funeral procession was unlike any in Iran's recent history and gave insight into how Soleimani's death is being felt personally by the supreme leader. It could also impact how Khamenei responds to the United States.\n\nFurther details regarding the aftermath of Soleimani's death and potential responses from Iran are still developing.",
    " Title: Michael Flynn Prepared to Testify That Trump Transition Officials Directed Contact with Russians\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is reportedly prepared to testify that President Donald Trump and transition officials directed him to make contact with Russian officials, according to ABC News. A confidant of Flynn reportedly stated that Flynn has \"promised full cooperation\" with special counsel Robert Mueller and is \"prepared to testify against President Trump, against members of the Trump family and others in the White House.\"\n\nAccording to ABC News, Flynn will testify that President Trump, as a candidate, ordered him to make contact with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point. However, ABC later corrected the report, stating that the order came when Trump was president-elect, not while he was a candidate. ABC also reported that Flynn will say Trump asked him to make contact with Russia \"initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria.\"\n\nOn Friday, Flynn pleaded guilty in federal court to making false statements to the FBI, a felony. The guilty plea is part of an agreement Flynn made with the special counsel's office, which is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nProsecutors also released Flynn's Statement of Offense, which detailed how Trump transition officials directed Flynn to reach out to Russian officials and officials from other countries during the presidential transition.\n\nIn a statement, Flynn said, \"my guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country.\"\n\nAccording to ABC, Flynn made the decision to cooperate with Mueller only in the past 24 hours, as he faced mounting legal bills and intense pressure from prosecutors. \"He is distraught about the decision, but feels he is doing the right thing for his country.\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version incorrectly attributed to The Associated Press that Trump ordered Flynn to contact Russians. It also included incorrect ABC reporting that Trump had ordered Flynn to contact Russians during the presidential campaign.",
    " Title: The Politicization of Supreme Court Nominations: A Look Back at the Confirmation of Antonin Scalia and Its Impact on the Judicial Process\n\nArticle:\n\nThe passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's longest-tenured jurist in this session, has not only marked the end of a distinguished legal career but also highlighted the breakdown of the legal and political process that has turned judicial confirmations into a contentious issue.\n\nScalia began his judicial career under President Ronald Reagan, having served in the Office of Legal Counsel under President Gerald Ford. Appointed initially for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Scalia's towering intellect made him an obvious choice for the Supreme Court. Four years later, when Chief Justice Warren Burger announced his retirement, Reagan had an opportunity to appoint either Scalia or Robert Bork, and he chose the younger Scalia.\n\nThe expectations of judicial confirmations in general, and Supreme Court nominations in particular, were much different 30 years ago. The general consensus held that elections had consequences, and presidents were entitled to significant deference on appointments\u2014even those with lifetime tenure, such as the federal bench. Senate rejection of Supreme Court nominees was not unknown, but even substantial opposition was rare.\n\nDespite a record of conservative decisions, Scalia benefited from this comity. Chosen in part for his youth and vigor, Scalia charmed the Senate Judiciary Committee and the upper chamber as a whole. He won confirmation on a 98-0 vote to become the first Italian-American to sit on the Supreme Court.\n\nThat turned out to be the last gasp of comity in judicial nominations. Less than a year later, Justice Lewis Powell retired, giving Reagan one more opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, and this time Reagan chose Bork. Democrats reacted angrily, in part because Bork had played a significant role in Watergate's \"Saturday Night Massacre.\" Of course, that was hardly the only reason that Democrats rallied to oppose Bork, who had made it clear that he found previous Supreme Court rulings on privacy to be unsubstantiated. His critics assumed that Bork would vote to overturn those precedents, especially the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion as a constitutional right. Pro-choice groups rallied opposition, and after a brutal confirmation hearing, Bork's nomination went down in defeat. Bork would later resign his seat on the DC Circuit in protest.\n\nThat touched off the politicization of judicial nominations that has overshadowed the death of Scalia. Democrats attempted to humiliate Clarence Thomas, but failed to defeat his nomination. Republicans delayed or blocked Bill Clinton's judicial appointments, and then Democrats responded with so many delays during the Bush years that it took the Gang of Fourteen deal in 2005 to retain the Senate filibuster and get some judicial appointments through the Senate.\n\nEven after that, Barack Obama himself voted to filibuster the confirmation of Samuel Alito in 2006. Going even further, Chuck Schumer pledged in mid-2007 that the Senate would approve no more Supreme Court nominations while George W. Bush was president\u2014a promise that did not get tested, as it turns out. When Barack Obama became president, Republicans fought his appointments until Harry Reid imposed the \"nuclear option\" that ended filibusters on judicial nominations, except for the Supreme Court.\n\nThat brings us to today, when one of the longest-serving members in the court's history has largely been forgotten in an unseemly scrum over who replaces him, and when. Republicans have adopted Schumer's 2007 position, while Democrats forget that the Senate has no obligation to approve nominees\u2014and that it was Democrats who were largely responsible for dispensing with deference to elected presidents in judicial appointments.\n\nA number of well-meaning thinkers have proposed stopgap solutions for this impasse. Jonathan Adler at The Washington Post suggested that a recess appointment of a retired Supreme Court justice could act as a stopgap until the next president takes office. Some argue that an open seat will actually work in favor of compromise; it would not affect cases that will get a substantial majority on the court, but any 4-4 ties that Scalia's vote would have settled will result in punts that have no precedential weight. Others want the Senate majority to work with the president to select a handful of mutually acceptable candidates, with the promise of expedited confirmation\u2014even though all of the political incentives will drive both sides away from compromise.\n\nNone of these solutions will work in a system where people lack the basic understanding of constitutional prerogatives on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and in which the Supreme Court has eclipsed both Congress and the president in creating policy. Scalia, ironically, spent nearly three decades attempting to move the court back to a less activist model. Had that effort succeeded, it would have made his own passing remarkable in itself rather than a bugle call for both sides to divvy up the spoils.\n\nEven with that, the epic breadth and depth of Scalia's impact on American jurisprudence may take several more decades to be fully appreciated. At the moment, though, the nearly 30-year tit-for-tat judiciary battle between Republicans and Democrats only deepens the belief among voters that America's institutions are failing its citizens, and that will be yet another reason for voters in both parties to look outside those institutions to make them work once more.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Receives Support from Dark Money Group in Florida\n\nArticle:\n\nElizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has received financial support from a dark money group, New Florida Majority, in the form of over $100,000 for canvassing and advertisements to boost her campaign in Florida. The support was disbursed between February 27 and February 29.\n\nWarren, who has previously expressed opposition to super PACs and dark money, has reportedly reversed course on accepting help from dark money groups. In November, when a dark money group ran an ad supporting Warren in Iowa, her campaign asked the group to halt its promotion of her.\n\nIn a statement, Chris Hayden, a spokesperson for Warren's campaign, said, \"Elizabeth Warren believes democracy is undermined by anonymous, dark-money attempts to influence voters\u2014whether that influence is meant to help or hurt her candidacy.\"\n\nWarren's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the new dark money effort to support her candidacy in Florida.\n\nNew Florida Majority endorsed Warren late last year, citing her plans for \"big structural change.\" Andrea Mercado, the group's executive director, stated, \"The stakes are too high for millions of Floridians in 2020. We're prepared to support whoever the candidate is to defeat Trump and his agenda of inequality and division, and our members endorse Elizabeth Warren as the best candidate for the job.\"\n\nNew Florida Majority claims to have helped reach 1.5 million voters and register 20,000 new voters in Florida as part of a coalition of liberal groups during the 2018 elections. The coalition, known as the Win Justice campaign, focused on the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, and Nevada.\n\nWin Justice's federal PAC was initially bankrolled by a $3 million check from liberal billionaire George Soros, who was the PAC's sole source of funding for months. Soros later contributed another $2 million to the committee. The PAC also received contributions from billionaire megadonor Donald Sussman, director Steven Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw, and a host of liberal groups, including the Center for Community Change, Planned Parenthood, and the SEIU.\n\nNew Florida Majority has a goal of registering 100,000 new voters for the 2020 elections. Last week, the group held a joint press conference with the Florida Democratic Party and two other activist organizations, boasting that the groups have registered tens of thousands of Floridians as Democrats. The Florida primary is scheduled for March 17.",
    " Title: Sen. Tom Coburn's 2013 Wastebook Highlights Extravagant Federal Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Tom Coburn's (R-Okla.) annual Wastebook, released on Tuesday, documents instances of extravagant federal government spending in 2013, a year marked by complaints of limited resources due to sequestration. The report, which scrutinizes the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies, highlights questionable spending practices, including the abandonment of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in Afghanistan and the purchase of unnecessary aircraft.\n\nThe DoD comes under particular scrutiny in Coburn's report. Despite Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's warning last July 31 that sequestration could lead to an unprepared military due to a lack of training, maintenance, and equipment, Coburn found that the DoD is leaving 2,000 MRAPs\u2014Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles\u2014behind in Afghanistan to be destroyed rather than delivered to other bases. These vehicles, which cost $500,000 each to build, were rushed through the procurement process in 2007 in response to increasing I.E.D attacks on NATO forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe report also documents the purchase of 21 C-27 transport planes manufactured in Italy, authorized by Congress despite a former Air Force chief of staff's testimony in August 2012 that under sequestration cuts, the Air Force did not want the plane. He also testified that the C-130 could perform the job better. Stuck with the $631 million purchase, the Air Force mothballed the C-27s in the desert before any of them flew a single operational mission.\n\nThe Wastebook also highlights other instances of extravagant spending, including:\n\n* The State Department spending $630,000 to attract followers to its Facebook and Twitter accounts.\n* NASA spending $3 million to study how Congress works.\n* The National Endowment for the Humanities spending nearly a million dollars over three years to explore the origins of popular romance in multi-media.\n* The estimated $319 million spent on building the Healthcare.gov website, with estimates projecting more than twice that will be spent on publicity and marketing.\n\nCoburn does not blame the agencies for the wasteful spending, but rather Congress. \"The reason it's hard work to cut spending is because somebody's ox gets gored\u2014somebody doesn't get money,\" he said. \"Most members of Congress are more interested in getting themselves re-elected than they are in fixing what's wrong with the country.\"\n\nCoburn's report spares neither Republicans nor Democrats. While he does not name names, he does name one title, the Senate Majority Leader\u2014Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Coburn attributed the Senate Majority Leader's refusal to adhere to regular order and bring appropriations bills to the floor as a contributing factor to Congress's lax oversight of federal government spending in 2013.",
    " Title: Catholic Leaders Gather at Notre Dame to Discuss Political Polarization and Its Impact on Catholic Life\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of ideologically diverse Catholic leaders recently gathered at the University of Notre Dame to discuss the impact of political polarization on Catholic life in the United States. The conference, titled \"Naming the Wounds, Beginning to Heal,\" aimed to change the tone of political engagement among priests, laypeople, and the hierarchy.\n\nThe Notre Dame conference distinguished itself by engaging the reality of polarization, acknowledging the existence of two major parties with distinct ideologies. Partisanship is a foundational social identity for many, with party loyalty often fixed by early adulthood and remaining stable throughout one's life.\n\nConservative evangelicals tend to align with the Republican Party due to their churches' affirmation of the GOP's social conservatism and sexual traditionalism, while being relatively silent on economic issues. Mainline Protestant denominations' political teachings align closely with the Democratic Party's platform, including strong support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nModerate evangelicals, black Protestants, and Eastern Orthodox traditions span both major parties, but the Catholic Church's broad political spectrum necessitates a focus on Catholic political engagement in a polarized context.\n\nRobert McElroy, the newly installed Catholic bishop of San Diego, delivered a speech last year on the moral dilemmas of partisanship. While acknowledging the role of parties in fostering mass participation in politics, he cautioned against their potential hostility towards human dignity and the common good.\n\nMcElroy argued that parties pose a paradox for the Christian citizen. While it is beneficial to have ideologically distinct parties pursuing different policy goals when in power, Christian political engagement ceases to exist when partisans abandon their religious principles to align with their party.\n\nThe conference addressed the concern that American Catholics have over the strain that partisan polarization has caused on their church and their consciences. Neither major party offers a platform that aligns with Catholic values on issues such as the unborn, the poor and hungry, undocumented immigrant families, the environment, and access to medical care.\n\nThe article concludes by suggesting that Catholics should strive for space in both parties for the full expression of Catholic social teaching. By prioritizing principles over party loyalty, Catholics can model authentic Christian political engagement and witness to their faith.\n\nJacob Lupfer, a contributing editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgetown University, wrote the article.

    " Title: GOP Seizes Political Opportunity in Health Care Ruling, Frames Mandate as Tax\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to uphold President Barack Obama's health care law was initially met with shock by Republican leaders, but they soon saw a potential political advantage in the ruling, according to House GOP sources. The court's decision validated one of the main arguments the GOP made against the health care bill throughout the 2009 debate, and Republican leaders have since focused on framing the individual mandate as a tax.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and other top House GOP leaders and aides watched the Supreme Court's ruling in Boehner's office Thursday morning. Initially, they were caught off guard when they learned that conservative Chief Justice John Roberts was the deciding vote. However, as the details of the ruling sank in, they realized they might have lost at the court but won politically.\n\nThe chief justice decided that the individual mandate in the law, which required Americans to carry health insurance, was a tax, which Congress was allowed to levy. Republicans seized on that argument and planned to turn it to their advantage. The high court had just validated one of the main points the GOP made against the health care bill throughout the 2009 debate.\n\nRepublican leaders announced they would follow through on their pledge to repeal the law or any piece of it if it was upheld. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said they would again vote to roll back the health care law after it returned from its weeklong Fourth of July recess.\n\nThe closed-door meeting to discuss the court's ruling was described as \"a little bit somber\" by Idaho Republican Rep. Raul Labrador. He said the court's decision \"was a little bit surprising.\" However, Labrador quickly pivoted to the tax message, stating, \"The bottom line is that the Supreme Court has said now that Congress has the authority and power to tax everyone for anything at any time, and the American people should be afraid of that.\"\n\nDuring the health care debate in 2009, President Obama argued that the individual mandate was not a tax. In an interview with ABC, Obama said, \"For us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it's saying is, is that we're not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase.\"\n\nRepublican congressional aides had already planned to make repealing health care a centerpiece of their fall campaign message. However, Roberts' decision gave them new ammunition and talking points in an area\u2014taxes\u2014where public opinion polls frequently show the Democratic Party can be vulnerable.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi would not directly answer when asked about the court's ruling that the mandate in the health care law was a tax. \"Call it what you will, it is a step forward for America's families,\" Pelosi said. She downplayed the new debate over Roberts' decision as \"Washington talk\" and emphasized the benefits of the law for those with pre-existing conditions who will now be able to get coverage.\n\nWhile the GOP moved to reframe the debate over health care, Democrats criticized Republicans for ignoring the economy and re-fighting a battle from two years ago. The Democratic campaign committee blasted out press releases about the 60 House Republicans it is targeting in November.",
    " Title: WHO Recommends Mask Usage During COVID-19 Pandemic: Guidelines and Precautions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn several Asian countries, the use of face masks has become common practice to combat the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In Europe and the United States, mask-wearing is less prevalent, but the question remains: Should individuals wear masks during the pandemic?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthy individuals should only wear masks under specific circumstances:\n\n1. If caring for someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n2. If an individual is coughing or sneezing themselves, or suspects they might have COVID-19.\n\nMasks work by capturing droplets that are dispersed in coughs, sneezes, and breath, which are the primary transmission routes of the new coronavirus. There are two main types of masks: surgical masks, which are strips of fabric worn across the nose and mouth, and closer-fitting ones, sometimes called respirators.\n\nClose-fitting masks, such as N95 masks, can offer good, but not total protection against infectious droplets. The next rank up, the N99-rated masks, can provide better protection, but some find them difficult to breathe through. The \"N\" rating refers to the percentage of particles of at least 0.3 microns in diameter that the mask is designed to block: N95 masks stop 95%, and N99 masks stop 99%.\n\nSome masks have a valve in the front to prevent moisture in exhaled breath from condensing on the inside, making the mask wet and more susceptible to virus penetration. Masks are only effective when combined with frequent handwashing and ensuring that one does not touch their face.\n\nAnyone using a mask should make sure their hands are thoroughly cleaned with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before putting it on. The mask should cover the mouth and nose, and there should be no gaps between the face and the mask. When the mask becomes damp, replace it with a new one. Do not reuse single-use masks.\n\n\"Wearing a mask can also reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces, which happens many more times a day than we all realize and is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene,\" said Stephen Griffin, an associate professor at Leeds University's Institute of Medical Research.",
    " Title: U.S. Conducts Over 80% of Multi-National Air Strikes Against Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is carrying out approximately 85 percent of the multi-national air strikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, according to the latest Pentagon report. The report, obtained last week by FoxNews.com, states that U.S. fighter planes and drones have conducted 819 strikes, compared to 157 from the 10 other countries participating in the coalition.\n\nThe U.S. began the strikes in Iraq on Aug. 8, and was joined by Australia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom roughly five weeks later. France was the first Western country, other than the U.S., to launch an air strike on Sept. 17, destroying an Islamic State depot. Canada joined on Oct. 7 and was the last to launch a strike.\n\nThe five other countries flying attacks in Iraq have committed at least 30 fighter jets and four support aircraft. Their missions have destroyed Islamic State military equipment such as vehicles and depots. At least one mission last month targeted a captured oil refinery, a top Australian military official said.\n\nHowever, U.S. military officials have released few specifics about the missions, including information about the accuracy of the strikes, which has been questioned. U.S. Central Command did not respond to several requests for information about strike accuracy and why the U.S. flies the vast majority of the sorties.\n\nDavid Johnson, vice admiral of the Royal Australian Air Force, recently told The Guardian that he wouldn't discuss enemy casualties or target locations for fear of Islamic State's \"aggressive propaganda campaign.\" Another challenge is that pilots, out of concern for killing civilians, have only a limited number of targets and reportedly can attack only at night.\n\nAnother issue is that Islamic State, a combination of a country and an army, presents an elusive and unconventional target. Dakota Wood, a defense expert at the Heritage Foundation and retired Marine Corps special operations officer, said that the decisions about which countries will fly which missions or how many missions involve several logistical and political factors.\n\n\"You have to find the right pilot to execute a mission in a given tactical environment, which includes fuel time, moving targets, and anti-air defenses,\" he said. \"This takes a certain amount of skill.\"\n\nWood also said the other countries could have joined in the effort under limited rules of engagement, like Germany did in the war in Afghanistan. He said, for example, that the Arab nations might not be willing to attack vehicles because such a strike would kill a lot of fighters.\n\nAnother possibility is that Central Command could be marshaling the majority of sorties to U.S. pilots, Wood said. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, is among those expressing concern about the challenges of zeroing in on ISIL or ISIS, as Islamic State is also known.\n\n\"We need more targeting capability,\" he recently told The New York Times.\n\nThat the combined 10 other countries have flown fewer attack missions is perhaps no surprise, considering the U.S. essentially has the world's biggest, most powerful military\u2014including roughly 4,800 attack and fighter planes among more than 13,600 aircraft. That's compared to the Royal Bahraini Air Force, which reportedly has less than 50 planes capable of dropping bombs on strategic enemy targets.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press Sunday that U.S.-led coalition warplanes carried out as many as 30 airstrikes overnight against ISIS militants in and around the group's de facto capital of Raqqa, in northeastern Syria, which brings the total to roughly 1,000. The Local Coordination Committees, a collective of activists, also confirmed the airstrikes, but neither group had casualty figures, and the strikes were not confirmed by the U.S. military.",
    " Title: Obama and Administration Prepare for Coordinated Push on Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is set to take a more active role in promoting the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, three years after its signing into law. The White House is planning a coordinated effort involving President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Jill Biden to sell Obamacare, according to senior administration officials.\n\nThis new phase, which coincides with the October opening of the insurance marketplaces, is being compared to a political campaign's push for early votes. Over the six-month enrollment period, the Obamas and Bidens will be used strategically, with their appearances in key states and weak markets aimed at boosting enrollment numbers.\n\nIn contrast to his past treatment of the law since the legislative fight ended in 2010, Obama has recently been more vocal about the benefits of Obamacare. In the last month, he has appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" held a videoconference with state health officials, dedicated a weekly address to the law, and tweeted about it with Katy Perry.\n\nThe increased involvement comes as the unpopular law enters a critical period. However, it also signals the stakes for Obama: it represents his best opportunity to prove critics wrong and begin turning around public opinion if the rollout meets expectations.\n\nObama has emphasized the first day to sign up for health care, but he is unlikely to mark it as a significant milestone due to the possibility of a government shutdown due to congressional gridlock. There will be events by advocacy groups and tweets from celebrities, but aides are reluctant to over-hype the first day, acknowledging that glitches and problems are likely.\n\nIn recent months, Obama has not only focused on the law more often in public, but its implementation has also consumed an increasing share of his attention behind closed doors. Obama regularly meets with health policy aides, pressing them for updates on Obamacare implementation.",
    " Title: Government Employee Unions Remain Strongest Part of U.S. Labor Movement Amidst Private-Sector Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of private-sector unions weakening due to factory shutdowns and corporate resistance, government employee unions have emerged as the most powerful segment of the U.S. labor movement. This strength has been a target for anti-union billionaires and foundations, who have used the Janus litigation to undermine the labor movement's strongest sector.\n\nThe Koch brothers and other billionaires have capitalized on the Janus case to finance efforts, through emails and door-to-door canvassing, to persuade government workers, including teachers, police, firefighters, social workers, and many others, to leave their unions and cease paying union fees.\n\nPresident Trump's latest Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, does not appear to be a supporter of workers or unions. In a 2014 opinion in a case involving a SeaWorld trainer killed by an orca whale, Kavanaugh wrote that the Labor Department was incorrect to fine SeaWorld. Dissenting in a 2-to-1 case, he suggested that the Labor Department should not regulate the safety of SeaWorld's trainers because they, like tiger tamers and bull riders, were sports and entertainment figures who accepted the risk of injury in hazardous businesses that usually regulated their own dangers.\n\nLabor unions may benefit from President Trump's efforts to increase coal, steel, and aluminum production and from his push to renegotiate NAFTA to stimulate domestic auto production. These actions could lead to the return of tens of thousands of mining and manufacturing jobs, potentially boosting union membership, but these gains would likely be a small fraction of the losses expected from the Janus ruling. Some experts estimate that more than a million workers will leave their unions over the next few years due to the Janus ruling.\n\nThere has been some positive news for labor. A new Gallup Poll found that public approval for unions has reached its highest level in 15 years. Unions have achieved several significant victories, particularly among white-collar workers: adjunct professors at many universities have unionized, as have journalists at The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The New Yorker, HuffPost, and Slate, and graduate teaching assistants at Harvard, Columbia, Brandeis, and other universities. There have also been unionization gains among nurses, bus drivers, and service-sector workers in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe U.S. labor movement is already weaker than in any other major industrialized nation. Only one in 10 American workers belongs to a union, down from more than one in three in the 1950s. Despite decades of employer resistance, compounded by the Trump administration's hostility, unions are not making the gains needed to reverse their decline. If America's unions do not rebound, this is likely to result in even more income inequality, wage stagnation, and control of the levers of power by corporations and wealthy donors.\n\nSteven Greenhouse, a labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times for 19 years, is writing a book about the history and future of the American labor movement.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Dishonesty in Healthcare Policy: A Critique of the Obamacare Repeal and Replace Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate surrounding health-care policy, particularly the repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), has been marked by partisan dishonesty rather than bipartisan cooperation, according to a recent analysis. The article argues that both the Republican and Democratic parties have made false promises and misrepresented their intentions in the health-care policy arena.\n\nFor seven years, Republicans campaigned on the promise to repeal Obamacare. However, it is now clear that for many of these politicians, this pledge was a sales pitch that expired after the election. On the other hand, Democrats, who passed Obamacare, made promises such as \"You can keep your plan!\", \"You can keep your doctor!\", and \"Your premiums won't go up!\", which have been proven false.\n\nThe article contends that the Republican \"repeal and replace\" bills debated over the past six months did not actually repeal Obamacare. Instead, they kept most of its regulations intact, particularly the popular ones. The GOP did seek to repeal and reform the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, but that is not the same as repealing Obamacare.\n\nThe article suggests that both parties are more concerned with political victories and protecting past lies than with genuinely addressing the issues at hand. For instance, President Donald Trump has shown a desire for a win, willing to sign any bill that claims to repeal Obamacare, while Democrats are determined to deny Trump the ability to claim such a victory.\n\nThe analysis concludes that the polarized, tribal climate in Washington is frustrating, as many of the debates are not about real issues but rather liars protecting past lies in the hope of making new lies seem plausible enough to continue repeating them. The Medicaid fight, while real, is the exception rather than the rule. The article calls for a more honest and fact-based approach to health-care policy-making.",
    " Title: Majority of Democratic Voters Support Clinton's Continued Presidential Bid Despite Email Scandal, According to Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll has revealed that a strong majority of Democratic voters believe Hillary Clinton should continue her presidential campaign, even if she is charged with a felony in connection with her private email use while serving as Secretary of State. The Rasmussen poll, released on Tuesday, found that 71% of Democratic voters support Clinton's continued candidacy under such circumstances, a view shared by only 30% of Republicans and 46% of unaffiliated voters. Overall, 50% of those polled said Clinton should keep running.\n\nLast week, the State Department inspector general released a report criticizing Clinton's email use, finding repeated warnings about cybersecurity were ignored and staffers who expressed concerns were told \"never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again.\" The FBI investigation into Clinton's email practices is still ongoing.\n\nDemocratic primary rival Bernie Sanders has avoided commenting specifically on the ongoing FBI probe, but campaign manager Jeff Weaver, in a Wednesday interview, questioned whether Clinton could continue her campaign if an indictment is handed down. \"That would be difficult to continue running a race,\" Weaver said.\n\nThe email scandal could potentially impact Clinton's general election prospects, with 40% of all voters saying they are less likely to vote for Clinton due to the email issue. However, 48% of voters said the email scandal would have no impact on their vote.\n\nThe poll also suggests that Clinton's argument that she did nothing illegal with her email use is not convincing many voters. According to the poll, 65% of voters consider it likely that Clinton broke the law with her email use, with 47% saying it's very likely.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted May 29-30 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Expands Use of DNA Tests for Immigration Matters in Response to Court Order\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States government, under a court order to swiftly reunite parents and children who were separated after crossing the border illegally from Mexico, has increased its reliance on DNA tests to establish paternity in immigration matters. According to government officials, DNA testing is a more expedient method of confirming parentage than relying on documents such as birth certificates.\n\nUnder the administration of President Barack Obama, DNA testing of unauthorized border-crossers was seldom used, former administration officials stated, but it was occasionally employed as a last resort to verify family connections when placing unaccompanied minors with sponsors in the United States. DNA testing is also employed to verify family ties of many refugees seeking permission for family members to join them in the United States.\n\nThe testing involves analyzing a small portion of DNA, known as \"short tandem repeats,\" to identify inherited regions of DNA that can vary from person to person. In a declaration filed with the U.S. District Court in San Diego on Thursday, U.S. Health and Human Services official Jonathan White described the testing as a \"faster but costlier method for confirming parentage than collecting and assessing documentation and anecdotal information.\"\n\nThe filing was made in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against Immigration and Customs Enforcement on behalf of parents who were separated from their children by immigration officials. The judge in that case has ordered that children under the age of 5 be reunited with their parents by Tuesday, and that all minors separated from their parents be reunited by July 26.\n\nWhite stated that field teams are taking swabs from the cheeks of children and adults and sending them to a third-party laboratory for analysis. The process takes about a week, he said in the declaration, though it can take longer to complete verification.\n\nLabCorp, one of the largest providers of DNA testing to prove parentage, stated it is not involved in the current testing of immigrant parents and children. DNA Diagnostics, another company certified for DNA testing, declined to comment on any testing authorized by the federal government.\n\nDave Silver, marketing director at DNA Diagnostics, said the company's tests to identify relatives can cost in the \"hundreds of dollars,\" due in part to expenses associated with ensuring \"chain of custody\" for the DNA. After the company conducts a DNA test at its laboratory, a written report is generally issued to whoever purchased the test, and the collected DNA is destroyed after six months.\n\n\"DNA testing is the method of parental verification most likely to protect children from harm given the compressed time frame imposed by the court's order,\" White said in his declaration. The testing is just one part of the reunification process, White said. Separately, DHS assesses parental fitness and potential child endangerment.\n\nNeither HHS nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to requests for information on the testing.",
    " Title: 2012 Presidential Race Reaches Record Degree of Triviality, Strategists and Observers Agree\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 presidential race is being described as reaching a record degree of triviality by strategists and observers, with the campaign unfolding as a grinding, joyless slog that falls short of the larger-than-life personalities and debates of previous elections.\n\nFor years, operatives, reporters, and potential nominees envisioned the 2012 presidential campaign as a titanic clash of media-swarmed combatants with big ideas about the future. However, the Republican primaries, in particular, were almost a mantra: this is the most important campaign in a generation.\n\nSince the beginning of the cycle, 2012 has unfolded as a campaign fought hour by hour in 140-character Twitter increments and blink-and-you-miss-it cable segments. The endless flood of caustic television ads and small-ball tactics have contributed to the race's triviality.\n\nThe Obama and Romney campaigns spend all day strafing each other on Twitter, decrying the campaign's lack of serious ideas for a serious time. Yet, at most junctures when they've had the opportunity to go big, they've chosen to go small. Obama has spoken in broad strokes about his accomplishments but has not yet outlined a detailed agenda for a second term. Romney has openly declared that he will not detail his policy proposals, such as slashing the size of government, to avoid giving his opponents ammunition.\n\nInstead, they have embraced a campaign that has been defined almost entirely by tactics and daily trench warfare, whether that's the chair of the Democratic Party labeling Romney a \"job cremator\" or the Romney campaign driving its campaign bus in circles around an Obama event honking the horn, in a stunt reminiscent of a third-tier frat house. Some antics satisfy their partisans but don't focus the national dialogue.\n\n\"Here's the sad part: They all believe it's a total crock but they can't abandon it,\" said Todd Purdum, the Vanity Fair editor and former New York Times White House reporter. \"Who's going to say, in the middle of an election year, we're going to come up with a new system and here's how we're going to play, and everyone's going to come along? History's shown that's not too successful.\"\n\nPurdum continued, \"Both campaigns right now are in a kind of defensive crouch. They're both very tightly clenched, and I don't think either one sees any advantage in talking expansively or philosophically.\"\n\n\"For the first time in my memory, we have a presidential race in which neither one of these candidates really likes to campaign,\" added Dan Rather, the longtime national news anchor who now hosts HDNet's \"Dan Rather Reports.\" \"They're not naturals like a Ronald Reagan or a Bill Clinton. I can't remember a race in my lifetime when you had candidates in both parties who didn't really like to campaign.\"\n\nThe expanding and hyperactive press corps doesn't help matters, Rather said.\n\n\"You have not just a 24-hour news cycle but a deadline every nanosecond.... So much of the reporting focuses on who said what in the last five minutes and who said what in response to that,\" he explained, musing that the tenor of the race could change after Labor Day. \"I think reporters, together with the inaccessibility of candidates, get caught up in a kind of ennui, if you will\u2014it's probably the only French word you'll ever hear me use\u2014and we are only in June.\"",
    " Title: Vice President Biden Advocates for Amnesty, Criticized for Potential Deportation Policy Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Joe Biden, in a speech at Miami Dade College in South Florida, may have prematurely announced the Obama administration's plans to review and potentially alter deportation policies. During the speech, Biden, who has expressed support for granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, reportedly responded to a shout of \"Stop deportations!\" by saying, \"We'll do that, too, kid, but let me finish my speech.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has faced pressure from pro-amnesty activists to unilaterally halt deportations and grant more amnesty, a notion that has been debunked by mainstream press reports from the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times. In response, the administration has reportedly initiated an administrative review of deportation laws, considering actions such as granting more forms of amnesty, not deporting illegal immigrants who have not committed major crimes, and allowing bond hearings for illegal immigrants.\n\nTwenty-two senators recently wrote a letter to President Barack Obama, criticizing his administration for potentially nullifying the nation's immigration laws and threatening the constitutional system. The senators' letter stated, \"Your actions demonstrate an astonishing disregard for the Constitution, the rule of law, and the rights of American citizens and legal residents.\"\n\nIn addition, Biden reportedly praised Florida for becoming the 20th state to grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, a move that could cost taxpayers up to $50 million. In 2012, Biden also declared his support for gay marriage before President Barack Obama had a chance to formally announce his position on the issue, a statement that reportedly led to a temporary freeze in their public appearances together.",
    " Title: Key Figures in Trump Administration Admit to Controversial Actions in Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a trip to Ukraine, President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has admitted to pushing for the removal of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch due to her perceived obstruction of investigations aimed at benefiting Trump politically. This admission is consistent with a strategy employed by Trump and his associates throughout his presidency: admitting to controversial acts, despite previous denials, and relying on loyalists in Congress and conservative media to defend the actions.\n\nIn a statement to the New Yorker, Giuliani said, \"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\" This admission comes as the House of Representatives impeached Trump on Wednesday, with only one non-Democrat, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), voting for impeachment.\n\nThe admission by Giuliani, Trump, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, among others, contradicts the denials made by Congressional Republicans regarding Trump's alleged abuse of power by withholding a White House meeting and military aid until Ukraine launched investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory about a Democratic National Committee server being in Ukraine.\n\n1. On October 3, Trump admitted to urging Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, during a press conference on the White House lawn.\n2. During an October 17 press conference, Mulvaney admitted to withholding military aid in exchange for an investigation into the DNC server, a \"quid pro quo.\"\n3. Sondland testified before the House Intelligence Committee that Trump refused to grant Zelensky a White House meeting until Zelensky announced the investigations Trump wanted.\n4. Trump, during a call to Fox & Friends, admitted to seeking investigations into corruption but clarified that he was referring to his conspiracy theory about the DNC server being in Ukraine.\n5. Since returning from a trip to Ukraine, Giuliani has provided new details about his efforts to force Yovanovitch's removal, claiming she obstructed justice and enabled Ukrainian collusion.\n\nThese admissions by Trump, Mulvaney, Sondland, and Giuliani do not deny the actions that Trump was impeached for ordering. They argue that the actions were justified, and the Republican-led Senate will have to decide if they agree.",
    " Title: Trump Urges GOP Critics to Overlook Recent Remarks on Judge's Heritage\n\nArticle:\n\nPresumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has urged Republicans who are critical of his recent comments regarding a judge's Mexican heritage to \"get over it.\" In an interview on Fox News' \"Hannity\" program, Trump stated, \"I don't care where the judge comes from or where judges come from - I just want to get a fair shake.\"\n\nTrump has been criticized for his remarks about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is of Mexican heritage and is overseeing a case against Trump University. Trump has argued that Curiel has a conflict of interest due to his heritage and Trump's pledge to build a wall along the United States' southern border.\n\nMany Republicans, including former 2016 GOP candidates Jeb Bush and John Kasich, have criticized Trump for these remarks. Trump acknowledged this criticism, stating, \"It's a little disappointing, some of the Republicans. And in all fairness, they're some of the people that I went through war with, and I won, and there's a lot of anxiety there. There's a lot of anger.\"\n\nTrump added, \"They just can't come back. They can't get over it. So they have to get over it, ideally. As to whether or not they endorse me, it's okay if they don't. But they have to get over it. They shouldn't be so angry for so long.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Mark Kirk, who is in a tough re-election fight this year in Illinois, also announced that Trump's comments about the judge, along with other attacks, pushed him to the point where he will not support the presumptive nominee. Kirk had previously stated he would support Trump if he was the nominee.\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Tuesday, Trump said his comments had been \"misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.\" He added, \"I do not feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.\"",
    " Title: Kellyanne Conway Found to Have Violated Federal Law Twice\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel (OSC) announced on Tuesday that Kellyanne Conway, senior counselor to the president, violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews last November and December. The OSC stated that Conway advocated against one Senate candidate and gave an implied endorsement of another candidate in the first interview, and advocated for the defeat of one Senate candidate and the election of another candidate in the second interview.\n\nThe interviews occurred during President Donald Trump's support for Judge Roy Moore in Alabama's U.S. Senate special election. Conway appeared in her official capacity as counselor to the president on both \"Fox and Friends\" and CNN's \"New Day\" and discussed why voters should support Moore over his Democratic opponent Doug Jones.\n\nThe OSC's statement reads, \"Ms. Conway\u2019s statements during the Fox & Friends and New Day interviews impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about candidates in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate.\"\n\nDuring her \"Fox and Friends\" interview, Conway said, \"Doug Jones in Alabama, folks don\u2019t be fooled, he\u2019ll be a vote against tax cuts. He\u2019s weak on crime, weak on borders. He\u2019s strong on raising your taxes. He\u2019s terrible for property owners. And Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal, which is why he\u2019s not saying anything and why the media are trying to boost him.\"\n\nThe OSC has referred its report to President Trump, but the White House quickly disputed the OSC finding, making it unlikely Conway will face any serious discipline. The White House deputy press secretary, Hogan Gidley, said in a statement, \"Kellyanne Conway did not advocate for or against the election of any particular candidate. She simply expressed the President\u2019s obvious position that he have people in the House and Senate who support his agenda.\"\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, wants the president to take disciplinary action against Conway. Cummings stated, \"This is not the first time that an independent government agency has recommended that the White House discipline Kellyanne Conway for breaking the law. Ms. Conway has received multiple trainings and warnings, yet she still refuses to follow basic ethics rules. The President must take swift and serious disciplinary action against Ms. Conway. Anything else sets a terrible example.\"\n\nThe report from the OSC claims the office gave Conway ample opportunity to respond to their report, which included a commitment from the White House counsel's office that Conway never followed through on. The report also details how Conway was briefed in some manner at least five separate times on the Hatch Act and the consequences for violating it.\n\nThe Hatch Act, which dates back to 1939, is intended \"to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation.\" There are a few exceptions to the rule, including the president, vice president, and some other federal employees.\n\nIn early 2017, Conway was similarly found to have violated federal ethics rules in an appearance on \"Fox and Friends\" when she urged viewers to purchase items from Ivanka Trump's clothing line. No significant disciplinary action was taken as a response.\n\nConway is not the first Trump White House official to be found in violation of the Hatch Act. Social media director Dan Scavino was issued a warning by the OSC after writing a tweet from his personal verified account against Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., calling for his defeat in a primary.",
    " Title: Arizona Senators and Representatives Divided on Family Separation Policy at U.S.-Mexico Border\n\nArticle:\n\nArizona Senator John McCain has condemned the Trump administration's family separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border, marking a break within Republican ranks on the controversial issue. Three of Arizona's five GOP House members have remained silent on the matter, while all four of the state's U.S. House Democrats have criticized the policy.\n\nU.S. Senator Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has hinted at his dismay in questions about the policy he posed to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. In a tweet on June 18, McCain, R-Ariz., stated, \"The administration's current family separation policy is an affront to the decency of the American people, and contrary to principles and values upon which our nation was founded. The administration has the power to rescind this policy. It should do so now.\"\n\nThe family separations have sparked a national outcry and have become a searing test of how far Americans are willing to go in their efforts to enforce immigration and border control. The White House has offered conflicting accounts of the policy and the reasons behind it. Officials have alternately blamed Democrats for the policy, denied its existence, or suggested it is intended as a deterrent to reduce illegal immigration.\n\nAs the administration founders, congressional Republicans have taken a wait-and-see approach, a tactic they have often employed in other high-profile spasms of controversies involving President Donald Trump. On June 18, U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, a Republican whose Tucson-based district includes part of the border with Mexico, issued a statement that suggests she does not like the separation tactics but does not find fault with the Trump administration.\n\nU.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democratic opponent of McSally in the race for the state's open Senate seat, has criticized the administration's policy. U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., has pointed the blame at former President Barack Obama.\n\nMcCain and Flake are Republicans who have cast themselves as the conscience of their party as their congressional careers wind down. McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer; Flake is not seeking re-election this year.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Allows Lawsuit Alleging Trump's Alleged Emoluments Clause Violation to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday dismissed President Donald Trump's latest attempt to halt a lawsuit accusing him of violating the Constitution by conducting business with foreign governments. Judge Peter J. Messitte's ruling in a Maryland court allows the plaintiffs, Maryland and the District of Columbia's attorneys general, to proceed with their case.\n\nThe lawsuit, which charges that Trump has violated the Constitution's little-used emoluments clause, seeks to investigate whether foreign countries have spent money at Trump's hotel in Washington. The Justice Department and Trump's attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post.\n\nThe Trump Organization could appeal the decision and request that Messitte deny the attorneys general access to Trump Organization employees and records until the appeal is decided. The Constitution bars federal officials from accepting emoluments from any \"King, Prince, or Foreign State.\"\n\nThe modern interpretation of the emoluments clause has not been settled, as most presidents, unlike Trump, do not run or take part in running their businesses while in office. Trump has maintained ownership of his business empire, including more than 10 hotels and golf clubs around the world. Although Trump has said he relinquished day-to-day management of his businesses, he still owns them and can withdraw money from them at any time, according to The Washington Post.\n\nA number of foreign governments have reportedly spent significant amounts of money at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, a few blocks from the White House. The hotel has rented out ballrooms to Kuwait and the Philippines and hosted leaders from Malaysia and Romania.\n\nThe plaintiffs may also seek access to Trump's tax returns, which he has refused to reveal, fueling speculation that the president has something to hide.",

According to prosecutors, Thurman strangled George after she ignored his catcalls while walking to her car in a UIC parking garage early Saturday morning.\n\nThe incident occurred when Thurman, who saw George walking to the UIC parking garage around 1:25 a.m. on Saturday, approached her and attempted to talk to her. George ignored Thurman's catcalls and efforts to engage her in conversation, and proceeded to her car. Prosecutors allege that Thurman then approached George from behind, put her in a chokehold, and dragged her from the ground before throwing her in the backseat of her car while she was unconscious.\n\nGeorge's family grew concerned when she did not return home and reported their concerns to UIC police. Tracing her cellphone to the parking garage, George's sisters and UIC police found her body in the backseat. She died from strangulation, according to a medical examiner.\n\nThurman was arrested on Sunday and is being held without bail. He was released last December after serving two years of a six-year prison sentence for armed robbery, UIC police said. During a hearing on Tuesday, Cook County prosecutors described the chilling circumstances that led to George's death.\n\nAuthorities recovered a condom and semen in the car, and surveillance camera footage showed Thurman, wearing a \"distinguishable white jacket,\" following George into the parking garage and running away from it 35 minutes later, authorities said. On Sunday, Thurman was spotted in the area and arrested. He admitted to choking George, throwing her in the car, and sexually assaulting her when she was unconscious, but \"denied having sexual intercourse with her,\" prosecutors said.\n\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago has not yet released a statement regarding the incident. The case is ongoing, and further details are not yet available.",

The following are some of the anticipated highlights from the schedule:\n\n1. Potential Dissent: Following the Pledge of Allegiance, the National Anthem, and the invocation, there may be a floor fight over new rules concerning the selection of delegates. Supporters of Texas Representative Ron Paul are expected to voice their objections, although their efforts to change the rules are unlikely to succeed.\n\n2. The Roll Call: In the late afternoon, delegates will officially nominate their candidates for president and vice president. The roll call is scheduled to conclude before 6:40 p.m. EST. The nominees are former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for president and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin for vice president.\n\n3. Rick Santorum: The last major challenger to Romney's bid for the presidential nomination, Rick Santorum, is scheduled to address the delegates during the 7 p.m. EST hour. Santorum was a vocal advocate for conservative views during the primaries.\n\n4. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker: Facing a recall vote due to his efforts to restrict public union collective bargaining rights, Walker has garnered support from many within the party. He is set to speak during the 8 p.m. EST hour.\n\n5. Former Representative Artur Davis: In 2008, Senator Joe Lieberman played the role of a former Democrat endorsing the Republican ticket.

    " Title: Abortion Debate and Supreme Court Nomination Impacting Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over the Supreme Court and its potential impact on abortion rights is gaining significant prominence, potentially influencing the midterm elections in an unpredictable manner. The issue is mobilizing both Democratic and Republican bases, creating a volatile environment for incumbents.\n\nDemocrats argue that the prospect of a Supreme Court nominee who could overturn the Roe v. Wade decision, legalizing abortion, will motivate their voters, potentially disadvantaging Republicans, particularly in the House of Representatives. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake stated, \"Our biggest ally here is their own rhetoric because they\u2019re not trying to finesse this in any way. They\u2019re clear about their agenda.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, are confident that the issue will energize their grassroots, which supported President Trump in 2016 due in part to his promises on Supreme Court nominees. A Senate Republican pollster noted, \"If you look at the way Trump won in 2016, a big part of that was energizing the evangelical base that didn\u2019t turn out in 2008 and 2012.\"\n\nThe potential impact of the abortion debate on the midterms could be twofold. Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at The Cook Political Report, suggests that the battle could drive up Democratic turnout in districts won by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. However, it could also help Republicans maintain their Senate majority.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans are concerned that a big battle over the court and abortion could cost them seats in states like Indiana, West Virginia, North Dakota, and Missouri, and potentially Montana. Conversely, Democrats, particularly Sens. Joe Donnelly (Ind.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.), are at risk in an abortion fight due to their states' less supportive attitudes towards abortion rights.\n\nIn West Virginia, only 35 percent of adults said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll. In Indiana, 43 percent said it should be legal, while 51 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) aims to have Trump\u2019s pick confirmed before the midterms. If a conservative nominee wins confirmation, it could \"fire up the Democratic base,\" according to Duffy. Conversely, if Senate Democrats seek to slow down or stop the confirmation process, it could \"wake up\" the Republican base in pro-Trump states, potentially helping Trump and the GOP shore up support from evangelical voters.\n\nAbortion rights could play out differently in various states. In Montana, more than 50 percent of voters favor abortion rights, which could help Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). In Nevada, a Gravis Marketing poll of registered voters found that 54 percent would oppose a ban on the ability to obtain an abortion. In Arizona, 49 percent of voters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a Pew poll.\n\nIn West Virginia, voters will also consider a state constitutional amendment declaring that \"nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" In Indiana, the issue is expected to heavily influence Sen. Joe Donnelly's (D-Ind.) reelection, given Vice President Pence's involvement in vetting potential Supreme Court nominees and a meeting between Trump and Donnelly to lobby him to support the pick.",
    " Title: Miller Affirms Commitment to CARES Act's Inspector General Provisions, Rejects Trump's Position on Presidential Supervision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a two-hour confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Brian D. Miller, President Trump's nominee for the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, asserted his intention to uphold the language in the $2 trillion CARES Act, which requires the new inspector general to report to Congress if impeded in his investigative work. This stance contradicts Trump's position, as expressed in a March 27 signing statement, which stated that the newly established watchdog could not be permitted or required to report to Congress without \"presidential supervision.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Miller also indicated that he would inform Congress \"immediately\" if any agencies asked him to withhold information, and that he would review any effort to distribute massive sums of taxpayer money to states for political gain as a violation. The exchange marked the most critical part of the hearing, which featured numerous questions from Democrats about Miller's independence given his current role as a White House lawyer.\n\nMiller repeatedly vowed to resist any pressure from the president or other administration officials seeking to undermine his independence. He cited his track record of battling with officials from George W. Bush's administration as a federal watchdog and vowed he wouldn't \"bend\" for anyone in Trump's orbit either.\n\nHowever, Miller declined to discuss his role in Trump's recent dismissal of intelligence community watchdog Michael Atkinson or the president's subsequent move to sideline another watchdog, Glenn Fine, who was initially picked to oversee the government's broad coronavirus response. Miller also declined to say whether he agreed with Trump's characterization of Atkinson as a \"disgrace to IGs.\"\n\nThe hearing became a skirmish in Congress' broader confrontation with Trump's efforts to dismantle or assert control over the independent watchdogs charged with monitoring his administration. Republicans largely backed Miller, rejecting suggestions that he might not be independent enough of the president.\n\nMiller is the first inspector general nominee to come before the Senate since Trump began a concerted effort to remake the community of federal watchdogs and remove those he has deemed, without basis, as acting with an anti-Trump bias. Senate Democrats have raised concerns about whether a White House aide can truly exercise independence from a president determined to tighten his grip on the inspector general community.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, stated, \"Looking at the last 20 years, we found only one IG candidate was nominated while serving in the White House counsel's office, another nominee served in the White House counsel's office under an earlier administration. Both of them resigned, one for politicizing the office, the other for a lack of independence. Not a great track record.\"\n\nMiller and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sparred as she pressed him to make commitments on what might constitute potential abuses worthy of investigation. Though he initially resisted engaging in \"hypotheticals,\" he agreed that a bailed-out corporation that lays off employees could spur an investigation, as well as companies that lobbied the White House and Congress before receiving funds.\n\nUnder questioning from Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Miller said all inspectors general should be willing to face firing for providing honest information to their superiors. \"You should never be afraid of stating the truth and if you have to be fired, you're fired,\" he said. \"But you always have to be prepared, at least, to walk away from your job.\"\n\nFor his part, Miller, who Trump tapped as \"special inspector general for pandemic response,\" pledged to operate free of political influence, in rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. Miller, who is likely to be confirmed in the Republican-controlled Senate, would oversee a $500-billion fund managed by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve meant to shore up companies and industries ravaged amid the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\"I think independence is vital for the effective operation of any inspector general,\" Miller said in response to questioning from the committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). \"I met with resistance throughout my tenure as inspector general. I conducted investigations of major contractors, much to the chagrin of leaders at the GSA...Ultimately I was proven right.\"",
    " Title: Obama Assures NATO Commitment, Addresses Greece's Economic Woes and Refugee Crisis in Final Foreign Trip\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama began his final foreign trip as president on Tuesday in Athens, Greece, emphasizing the U.S. commitment to NATO and offering support for the Greek people amid economic struggles and a refugee crisis. In a meeting with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, Obama stated that a strong NATO is of \"utmost importance\" and will provide \"significant continuity even as we see a transition in government in the United States.\"\n\nPavlopoulos expressed gratitude for U.S. support during Greece's time of social and economic crisis and expressed confidence that President-elect Donald Trump \"will continue on the same path.\" Trump's election has generated significant unease in Europe due to his campaign rhetoric suggesting the U.S. might withdraw from NATO if other countries do not pay more.\n\nObama also met with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and offered support for the Greeks as they navigate economic woes and a massive influx of refugees. Obama pledged to continue advocating for the view that \"austerity alone can not deliver prosperity\" and that \"it is going to be important both with respect to debt relief and other accommodative strategies to help the Greek people in this period of adjustment.\"\n\nThe U.S. president is making the first visit by a sitting U.S. president to Greece since Bill Clinton in 1999. Security measures were tight, with major roads closed along Obama's motorcade route, a ban on public gatherings and demonstrations in certain areas, and boats prohibited from sailing near the coastline. More than 5,000 police were deployed in Athens for the two-day visit, and left-wing and anarchist groups have planned protest demonstrations for Tuesday afternoon.\n\nOn Wednesday, Obama is scheduled to tour the Acropolis and give a major speech about democracy and globalization before flying to Berlin. From Germany, Obama will travel to Peru for an Asian economic summit before returning to Washington on Saturday. Greece's government has hailed Obama's visit as being of \"huge importance\" for both Greece and Europe.\n\nGreece's left-led coalition government has been grappling with a six-year financial crisis that has devastated its economy and left more than a quarter of the workforce unemployed. The government is relying on emergency loans from three consecutive multi-billion euro bailouts from other European Union countries and the IMF since 2010. The U.S. has praised Greece's economic reforms but has stressed the need for continued austerity measures.\n\nThe government is also seeking recognition of Greece's role in Europe's refugee crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands of refugees pass through Greece from Turkey on their way to the more prosperous countries of the European north. More than 60,000 people are currently stranded in Greece, living in poor conditions in overcrowded camps. Rights organizations have urged Obama to highlight the refugees' plight and Europe's response to the crisis during his visit.",
    " Title: Medical Guidelines and Decisions Regarding Hormone Treatment for Transgender Youth\n\nArticle:\n\nDeciding to start estrogen or testosterone treatment for transgender youth is a significant decision, as these hormones can cause irreversible cosmetic changes such as body fat redistribution and voice changes. Medical guidelines generally recommend that such treatments should not be initiated until the age of 16, or at the earliest, 14. However, existing data suggests that access to estrogen or testosterone is associated with improved mental health for these young individuals.\n\nRecent attention has been given to the possibility that some transgender youth may later choose to discontinue hormone treatment. A case study published by a group from Harvard Medical School reported a rare instance of an adolescent who started estrogen and later chose to stop. The young person expressed that they did not regret the trial of estrogen, as it helped them better understand their gender identity, despite experiencing cosmetic changes to their body, primarily body fat and hair distribution.\n\nIn other cases, transgender youth may \"de-transition\" due to societal pressure to conform to cisgender norms. While conservatives often highlight the potential for youth to regret the physical changes from estrogen or testosterone, doctors who care for these patients argue that it is far more likely that a young transgender person will have regrets when physicians refuse to provide the medical care to pause the puberty that is causing distress.\n\nThe potential benefits of providing gender-affirmative care generally outweigh the minor risks associated with treatment. These medications are administered only after thoughtful conversations between patient, family, and physician. Medical interventions are not started without all three being on board and understanding the risks and benefits. Legislation that puts these decisions in the hands of the government instead of families and physicians is dangerous.\n\nConservatives often use phrases like \"sex change surgery\" to alarm the general public. Under current medical guidelines, genital surgeries for transgender patients are never offered before adulthood. The only surgeries that are sometimes considered before the patient is an adult are the removal of breast tissue. This requires careful evaluation before proceeding. Easier access to puberty blockers in the first place could eliminate the need for this kind of surgery.\n\nState legislators are encouraged to educate themselves about transgender youth and their medical care before introducing legislation that may harm them. They should reach out to physicians and professional medical societies for input, talk to researchers in this area, and most importantly, bring in the transgender youth themselves. If their bodies are going to be legislated, they should have the opportunity to be heard by the legislators who would do this to them. The medical profession has made it clear: This kind of legislation is dangerous and should not become law.\n\nDr. Jack Turban, a resident physician in child and adolescent psychiatry at the Massachusetts General Hospital, researches the mental health of transgender youth.

    " Title: U.S. Has Evidence and Legal Justification for Syria Strike, Officials Say\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has both the evidence and legal justification to carry out a military strike against Syria, according to U.S. officials. The strike is aimed at deterring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons again.\n\nA key piece of the intelligence, according to these officials, is an intercepted telephone call between Syrian military officials. One of the officials seems to suggest that the chemical weapons attack was more devastating than intended, with one intelligence official stating, \"It sounds like he thinks this was a small operation that got out of control.\"\n\nHowever, Republican lawmakers have said White House officials dismissed suggestions that the scale of the attack was a miscalculation, indicating that the officials believe Syria intended to inflict widespread damage. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, stated, \"I'm comfortable that the things the president told Assad not to do he did.\"\n\nThe briefing by the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, was attended by seven other Republican senators, as well as Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice. The conference call was unclassified, meaning the administration provided lawmakers with limited details about the intelligence they assert bolsters the case for a military strike.\n\nBefore the call, some prominent lawmakers expressed anger that the White House was planning a strike without significant consultations with Congress. Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on MSNBC, \"When we take what is a very difficult decision, you have to have buy-in by members and buy-in by the public. I think both of those are critically important and, right now, none of that has happened.\"",
    " Title: Trump Excludes Romney from Coronavirus Task Force, Continuing Feud with Senator\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has announced a list of senators invited to be part of the president's task force focused on reopening America during the coronavirus pandemic. Notably absent from the list is Republican Senator Mitt Romney, one of President Donald Trump's most vocal critics within his own party.\n\nTrump's exclusion of Romney from the task force, dubbed the \"Opening Up America Again Congressional Group,\" appears to be a continuation of their ongoing feud. The group is aimed at addressing strategies for reopening the economy amid the ongoing pandemic.\n\nAn official told CNN that the president personally reviewed the list of invited lawmakers before its public release on Thursday. A spokesperson for Romney confirmed to The Hill that he was not asked to participate in the task force.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Romney dates back to Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, when Romney, then a fellow Republican, made a speech urging Americans to strategically vote to prevent Trump from winning the party's nomination. Despite a brief reconciliation, during which Trump considered Romney for a cabinet position and supported Romney's Senate bid in 2018, their relationship has since deteriorated.\n\nRomney has continued to criticize Trump in the media, and was the only Republican senator to vote in favor of impeaching the president on charges of abuse of power earlier this year. In response, Trump has labeled Romney as a \"Democrat secret asset,\" a \"failed presidential candidate,\" a \"Republican in name only,\" and \"one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.\"",
    " Title: Michigan Legislature to Vote on Abortion Coverage Ban, Bypassing Governor's Veto\n\nArticle:\n\nMichigan's Republican-controlled Legislature is set to vote on a measure that would prohibit abortion coverage from all health insurance plans, requiring women to purchase a separate policy to cover the procedure. The state election board certified on Monday that anti-choice group Right to Life of Michigan collected the necessary signatures to put the measure before lawmakers, a majority of whom support the ban.\n\nLast year, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed an identical ban on abortion coverage, stating the measure \"went too far.\" This time, Michigan Right to Life introduced the restriction through a rarely used initiative petition, which can become law without executive action by the governor. The ban contains no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.\n\nThe move to bypass Snyder's veto has been criticized by reproductive health advocates, who have labeled the proposal as an attempt to force women to purchase \"rape insurance.\" Meghan Groen, director of government relations for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, told RH Reality Check, \"You couldn\u2019t buy a rider once you were pregnant to have [an abortion] covered. It\u2019s not like, oh, I was raped and so now I\u2019ll buy this rider. Nobody is anticipating being a victim of crime.\"\n\nJessica Tramontana, communications director for Progress Michigan, said in a statement on the proposal, \"It\u2019s unconscionable that Right to Life has launched a campaign against women\u2019s rights by finding a loophole in the law and skirting a signature from the governor. The president of Right to Life went as far as describing this extra insurance like buying coverage for a 'flood or a car accident.' Rape is not an accident.\"\n\nThe measure itself is also deceptive, as Michigan and federal law prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortion care. However, anti-abortion activists have circulated the false idea that the Affordable Care Act will change the status quo. \"There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there about what this actually does,\" Groen added.\n\nA majority of Michigan voters appear to oppose the measure, and identical proposals have been vetoed -- twice -- by Republican governors. However, advocates say the state Legislature has taken an extreme rightward turn and may push the measure through despite the lack of support.",
    " Title: Obama Addresses Nation on Navy Yard Shooting, Calls for Change in Gun Violence Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivered a speech on Sunday, addressing the shooting incident at Washington's Navy Yard that left 12 people dead and 8 wounded. The president emphasized that the United States \"cannot accept\" the shooting as \"inevitable,\" but rather, it should \"lead to some sort of transformation\" in the nation's approach to gun violence.\n\nObama honored each victim, sharing personal details about their lives and the last things they said before they died. He expressed his condolences to the families of those killed, stating, \"Our tears are not enough.\"\n\nTwelve people were killed and eight were wounded when Aaron Alexis, a Navy contractor, entered the large naval installation in Washington and opened fire in Building 197. The victims, whose ages ranged from 46 to 73, all worked at the Navy Yard.\n\nThe issue of gun violence has been a significant focus of Obama's second term in office, with a concerted effort to strengthen gun laws following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. However, the proposed changes failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, with lawmakers on Capitol Hill unable to pass any laws tightening gun restrictions.\n\nIn response to last week's shooting at Navy Yard, most gun-control advocates were resigned to the fact that not much in the way of legislative changes would be made. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a supporter of gun control, stated on Tuesday, \"We don't have the votes. I'd like to get them, but we don't have them now.\"\n\nObama called for a change in the nation's approach to gun violence, stating, \"I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions, including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners, while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis.\"\n\nThroughout the speech, the president acknowledged a hesitance in Washington to fight over gun laws and stated that change would need to come because of the American people's desire for it. He concluded, \"If we really want to honor these 12 men and women, if we really want to be a country where we can go to work and go to school and walk our streets free from senseless violence without so many lives being stolen by a bullet from a gun, then we're going to have to change. We're going to have to change.\"\n\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray joined Obama on Sunday in calling for tighter gun laws in response to the shooting, stating, \"Our country is drowning in a sea of guns.\" In taking the stage, Obama was stepping into a role he has become very familiar with, counselor-in-chief, and Sunday's remarks were reminiscent, in some ways, of past speeches he has given at memorial services for mass shootings.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Email Scandal and Polling Numbers in Swing States\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week was a challenging one for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. A Q-poll of voters in the swing states of Colorado, Virginia, and Iowa showed her with substantial unfavorable margins on trust, empathy, and overall favorability. A new NBC/WSJ survey corroborates Quinnipiac's findings, measuring Mrs. Clinton's ratings approximately 20 points underwater in two early battleground states.\n\nChuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, described the numbers as \"dismal\" and \"troubling\" for the Clinton campaign during yesterday's program. According to Todd, Clinton's favorability ratings stand at 37/56 in Iowa and 37/57 in New Hampshire.\n\nOn Friday, it was reported that two Inspectors General have requested a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Hillary Clinton's improper email server and usage. MSNBC tastemaker Mark Halperin described this development as a \"disaster\" for her campaign if a criminal probe moves forward.\n\nIn response to the New York Times' reporting, the Clinton campaign has been engaging in what some perceive as \"highly Clintonian parsing.\" It remains unclear whether the IG referrals to the DOJ were explicitly criminal in nature or if that determination has not yet been made. The investigation may focus on those responsible for Clinton's emails, not necessarily Clinton herself.\n\nIt is worth noting that Hillary Clinton ordered the (scandalously under-secured) server to be set up in the first place, misused it, and then ordered its contents culled prior to putting on a belated smoke-and-mirrors show of \"complying\" with records-keeping requirements.\n\nGabriel Malor, a political commentator, provided a quick Twitter primer on the implications of Clinton's classified \"spillage\" problem. Aside from her lying about it, which is hardly unusual for her, key takeaways include:\n\n1. Any government employee with a 10% spillage rate would be fired immediately and face a difficult search for other spills.\n2. Clinton email situation referred to FBI counterintelligence for investigation.\n3. IG review: Clinton sent classified material.\n\nClinton has been ignoring her problems and playing the woman card, as she is wont to do in times of distress. For instance, she mentioned \"those guys on the other side\" and then said, \"They're all guys, btw. Oh, there's one woman.\" She then paused and said, \"Oh, I forgot about that.\"\n\nWith Team Hillary's 'deflect, deny, distract' machine in full swing, Wall Street Journal reporter Byron Tau is trying to focus people's attention on two core facts:\n\n1. Exactly. Frustrated by stonewalling, two IGs referred the matter of Hillary Clinton's improper email usage to the DOJ for an investigation, which evidently involves the FBI's counterintelligence division.\n2. In direct contradiction of her previous assertions, Clinton did use her private server and account(s) to share classified materials.\n\nAs it happens, Carly Fiorina, a potential Republican candidate, appears to be gaining steam with the GOP electorate, and deservedly so.",

Marco Rubio engaged in a series of contentious exchanges during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday. The discussions centered on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines.\n\nSen. Rubio (R-Fla.) cross-examined Tillerson, pressing him on his stance towards Russia, Cuba, and Saudi Arabia. In response to Rubio's questioning, Tillerson emphasized his deliberative approach and sought to allay any concerns Rubio may have had.\n\nDuring the exchanges, Rubio attempted to get Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"war criminal\" and to categorize Saudi Arabia as a \"human rights violator.\" Tillerson, however, declined to make such declarations.\n\nIn his opening statement, Tillerson took a harder line towards Russia, describing it as a \"danger\" but stopping short of labeling it an \"enemy\" of the U.S. He also criticized Russia's annexation of Crimea, stating that it was an \"illegal taking of territory that was not theirs.\"\n\nRussia dominated the early proceedings of the hearing, with senators questioning Tillerson about alleged meddling in U.S. politics by the Kremlin and Tillerson's own business ties to Russia. Tillerson emphasized his loyalty to the U.S. and stated that he would serve no one's interests but those of the American people.\n\nTillerson also addressed other areas, taking aim at China's \"illegal\" building of man-made islands in the South China Sea and expressing concern over radical Islam and cyber intrusions as the \"greatest and most complex threat\" facing the U.S.\n\nOn Syria, Tillerson stated that the U.S. currently had too many competing goals and needed to focus on defeating ISIS before discussing who should lead the country. He also criticized the Obama administration's dual priorities of ousting President Bashar al-Assad and eradicating ISIS, stating that these priorities sometimes conflicted with each other.\n\nTillerson called ISIS an imminent threat but named cyber intrusions as the \"gravest and most complex threat\" facing the U.S. He also criticized the Obama administration, stating that the U.S. government had \"stumbled\" under its leadership.\n\nOne moment of levity occurred when Sen. Tim Kaine asked Tillerson about ExxonMobil's climate change policies. Tillerson responded that Kaine would need to ask current executives, to which Kaine asked if Tillerson lacked \"the knowledge to answer my question or are you refusing to answer my question?\"\n\nOn the topic of President-elect Donald Trump's frequent use of Twitter, Tillerson stated he would not \"tell the boss how to communicate with the American people. That's going to be his choice.\"\n\nThe hearing took place a day after a contentious Senate session involving Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions. Protesters, including Code Pink activists dressed as the Statue of Liberty, a man dressed in a suit made of money, and some protesters in T-Rex costumes, were present at the hearing. One early protester was ejected after she screamed \"I reject you!\" at Tillerson.",

The discussion between the two candidates was initiated by ABC's Jimmy Kimmel during a Thursday night interview, and Trump has indicated a willingness to participate in the debate.\n\nDuring the interview, Kimmel asked Sanders if he had seen Wednesday's show, where the host had posed a hypothetical debate question from Sanders' campaign to Trump. Trump jokingly asked about the payment for such an event. Sanders responded by stating that the proposed debate would provide an interesting comparison of two candidates with different worldviews.\n\nTrump, in his response on Wednesday, expressed a desire for the proceeds of the debate to go to charity, and he reiterated this stance on Thursday. \"That could happen,\" he said. \"I've been saying that should happen anyway. If he paid a nice sum for charity, I would love to do that.\"\n\nSanders himself broached the topic of a potential debate during a Revolt TV town hall on Thursday morning in Hollywood. He stated, \"I understand that yesterday on the Jimmy Kimmel show, which I'm going to be recording later today, Donald Trump has agreed to debate me. I look forward to that.\"\n\nLater in the day, Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, expressed hope that Trump would not \"chicken out\" after discussing the possibility of a one-on-one debate. Trump, however, stated that he would \"love to debate Bernie.\"\n\nTrump suggested that the debate could raise funds for women's health issues and could potentially take place in a large arena. He also mentioned that his team has been in discussions with several networks about hosting the debate.\n\nThroughout the day, both candidates submitted questions for each other to answer on their respective shows. Trump submitted a question for Kimmel to ask Sanders about running as an independent if the Democratic primary process is perceived as rigged. Sanders responded humorously, expressing his intention to run as the Democratic nominee and expecting to win the election.\n\nDuring the town hall, Sanders also commented on Hillary Clinton's statement that she is the \"nominee for my party...That is already done.\" Sanders noted that the recent primary results do not align with Clinton's assessment and expressed optimism about his chances in the upcoming California primary.",

Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced next month after pleading guilty in a Washington, D.C. court last year to charges of conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nIn a sentencing memo submitted to the court on Friday but made public on Saturday, prosecutors told Judge Amy Berman Jackson that Manafort \"brazenly violated the law.\" The memo states, \"Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law\u2014 whether the laws proscribed garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud, or more esoteric laws that he nevertheless was intimately familiar with, such as the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\"\n\nThe memo further describes Manafort as demonstrating a \"hardened adherence to committing crimes.\" It states, \"His criminal actions were bold, some of which were committed while under a spotlight due to his work as the campaign chairman and, later, while he was on bail from this Court.\"\n\nManafort had initially agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation after pleading guilty, but the plea deal fell apart after Judge Jackson ruled earlier this month that he intentionally lied to Mueller's office, the FBI, and the grand jury in his case. The ruling meant prosecutors were no longer bound by the plea deal.\n\nIn the D.C. case, Manafort faces a maximum sentence of 10 years. In a separate case in Virginia, Manafort was found guilty on eight counts in a sprawling bank and tax fraud case. He faces up to 24 years in prison and tens of millions of dollars in possible fines for that conviction. Manafort's sentencing in the Virginia case is also scheduled for March. Prosecutors have urged Judge Jackson to consider stacking his sentence in D.C. on top of his punishment in Virginia. Lawyers for Manafort are due to file their sentencing recommendation in D.C. on Monday.\n\nSeparately, authorities in New York are reportedly preparing charges against Manafort for violating state tax laws and other financial crimes, according to reports by Bloomberg News and The New York Times on Friday.",

Trump's tweets came in response to reports that Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his conversations during the presidential transition with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about sanctions related to the Kremlin's election interference.\n\n\"I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn,\" Trump tweeted. \"Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\"\n\nIn June, Comey testified before Congress that Trump pressured him during an Oval Office meeting in February to end the investigation into Flynn. Trump's lawyers have disputed that account.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to federal investigators about his conversations during the presidential transition with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about sanctions related to the Kremlin's election interference. He became the first person to have held a position in the Trump administration to be charged by the special counsel.\n\nIn an apparent shift on Saturday, Trump tweeted that he had to fire Flynn as national security adviser because the retired Army general lied to Vice President Pence and the FBI.\n\n\"I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,\" Trump said in the tweet. \"It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\"\n\nTwo sources familiar with that tweet told The Washington Post on Saturday that John Dowd, Trump's personal lawyer, had crafted that tweet.\n\nAfter Flynn was fired, Trump said in February that \"I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple.\"\n\nSome legal experts have speculated that if Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI and then asked Comey to drop the investigation, it could amount to obstruction of justice.\n\n\"This is a pretty substantial confession to essential knowledge elements of an obstruction of justice charge,\" Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution, tweeted on Saturday.\n\nTrump told NBC News in May that he was thinking of \"this Russia thing\" when he decided to fire Comey, who had been leading the FBI probe into Russia's election meddling.\n\n\"When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,'\" Trump said.\n\nThe White House days earlier had attributed Comey's firing to his handling of the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email server.\n\nComey himself offered a cryptic message on Saturday shortly after Trump's tweet about Flynn's firing.",

In a series of tweets, Trump stated, \"The Federal Reserve must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!\"\n\nThe Fed's rate cut on Tuesday brought interest rates down to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. The move followed a news conference by Fed Chairman Jay Powell, who emphasized that the decision to cut rates was due to the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. He stated, \"The magnitude and persistence of the overall effects on the economy, however, remain highly uncertain and the situation remains a fluid one.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the central bank's move, saying, \"I applaud the Fed on this move.\" Trump, who has often used stock market gains as a measure of his presidency, has been vocal about his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates. On Monday, he tweeted, \"As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act. Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive.\"\n\nTrump added, \"The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We do not, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. We should be leading, not following!\" The current Fed benchmark rate stands in a range of 1% to 1.25%.\n\nThe Fed's move to lower rates came on the same day the G-7 announced a commitment to unspecified tools to help the global economy deal with the threat of the coronavirus outbreak, and as Wall Street was in the midst of another market sell-off. The market turned in its worst performance since the financial crisis last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 12%. It made up some of that ground on Monday, rising more than 1,200 points, for the biggest one-day point gain ever.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Trump reiterated his disappointment in the Fed's decision, telling reporters, \"The Fed is following, not leading.\" The exact implications of the Fed's decision and its impact on the economy remain to be seen.",

    " Title: Senate Document Alleges Christopher Steele Misled FBI in Obtaining FISA Warrant\n\nArticle:\n\nA Senate document released Tuesday evening has alleged that Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous Trump-Russia dossier, misled the FBI to secure a wiretap on a Trump campaign volunteer, Carter Page, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The disclosure further tarnishes an FBI already under fire from Republicans for concealing the dossier's Democratic financing.\n\nThe controversy revolves around the FISA warrant issued by a judge on Oct. 21, 2016, to monitor Carter Page. According to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, Charles E. Grassley, the document refers to Christopher Steele and suggests that the FBI believed it had corroboration for the dossier when it did not.\n\nThe discredited dossier, the referral states, was the primary piece of evidence cited by the FBI in the FISA application. Steele accused the Trump campaign of colluding with the Kremlin, with Page being implicated. All involved deny the charges.\n\nThe Senate referral, signed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, asks the Justice Department to investigate potential criminal charges against Steele. It reports that a Sept. 23, 2016, Yahoo News story reporting the same information was cited by the FBI to the judge as corroboration. However, the FBI did not have corroboration, only the dossier and a news story based on that very dossier.\n\nMoreover, the FBI misrepresented Steele's role in the Yahoo News story to the FISC judge, stating that he did not directly provide the information to the press, when in fact he did. The FBI continued to seek 90-day wiretap renewals based on Steele's reputation, even after he misled agents.\n\nThe document also reveals that Steele wrote a memo on Oct. 19, 2016, showing that he received anti-Trump information from Clinton associates funneled through the State Department. Chairman Grassley is investigating the roles of Clinton operators Sid Blumenthal and Cody Shearer.\n\nRep.

    " Title: Senate Confirms Vivek Murthy as U.S. Surgeon General After 17-Month Vacancy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Vivek Murthy as the nation's Surgeon General on Monday, ending a year-long confirmation process that began in November 2013. The vote was 51-43.\n\nDr. Vivek Murthy, an MD and MBA, practices and teaches at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. He co-founded a clinical trials company, an HIV education organization, and Doctors for America, formerly known as Doctors for Obama.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) was critical of Murthy's nomination, citing tweets he had written criticizing guns and the NRA. The NRA also viewed Doctors for America as being against guns. However, the group's advocacy for the Affordable Care Act, rather than its stance on gun control, was the primary concern that delayed Murthy's confirmation.\n\nDoctors for America also supports stricter gun control laws, including background checks, mandatory safety training, and banning certain semiautomatic weapons. Murthy has stated that, if confirmed, he would target obesity, not guns. His colleagues, including Dr. Chris Lillis, the Virginia state director for Doctors for America, have defended him.\n\nMurthy's confirmation was also delayed due to the midterm elections, as many Democrats up for reelection in red states said they would join Republicans and vote no. With Congress now in a lame-duck session, he received more support from Democrats.\n\nSince former Surgeon General Regina M. Benjamin left the post in the summer of 2013, it has been filled on an interim basis by Rear Admiral Boris D. Lushniak. President Obama issued a statement on Murthy's confirmation, praising his qualifications and expressing confidence in his ability to promote public health and keep Americans safe.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Disapprove of Senate GOP's Health Care Bill, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll has revealed that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Senate Republican's health care bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act. Only 17% of those surveyed approve of the bill, while 55% disapprove. About a quarter of respondents said they had not heard enough about the proposal to have an opinion on it.\n\nThe Senate GOP's health care plan has faced mounting defections within the Republican caucus, leading to a delay in a vote on the legislation until after Congress returns from its July Fourth recess. A Congressional Budget Office analysis released Monday found that if the bill were enacted, 22 million fewer people would have health insurance over the next decade due, in part, to the bill's rollback of Medicaid expansion.\n\nLee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, stated, \"With numbers like these, it's not surprising the Republican leadership in Congress is having a difficult time building consensus.\"\n\nWhile Democratic opposition to the bill is high, GOP support for the Senate GOP's plan is very soft. Twenty-one percent of Republicans oppose the bill, and just 35% support it. Sixty-eight percent of independents also oppose the proposed legislation.\n\nThe poll also found that while many Americans want changes to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, they want it to be more far-reaching. A 46% plurality say they want to see the ACA do more, while just 7% want it to do less. Keeping the ACA and having it do less is essentially what GOP congressional plans are doing.\n\nOnly 17% want the 2010 bill left intact and unchanged, while a quarter of Americans want it repealed completely\u2014including just over half of Republicans.\n\nIf Congress does not go through with a repeal of the ACA, 37% of Americans said they would blame Republicans in Congress, while 23% would blame Democrats, and 15% would blame President Trump.\n\nAmong Republicans, Trump would not bear the brunt of the blame if Congress is unable to repeal and replace Obamacare. Just 6% would blame him, and half said they would blame congressional Democrats. Another 20% said they would blame GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll surveyed 1,205 adults from June 21-25, 2017, contacted by live interviewers using a mix of landline and mobile numbers. The margin of error is \u00b1 2.8 percentage points. A sub-sample of 995 registered voters were also surveyed, with a \u00b1 3.1 percentage points margin of error. Questions relating to how congressional Republicans are handling the issue of health care, the plan proposed by Senate Republicans, and whom should be blamed if Congress does not repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were fielded from June 22-25, 2017, with 939 adults and 769 registered voters. The margin of error is +/- 3.2 percentage points and +/- 3.5 percentage points, respectively.",
    " Title: Four Strategies for Confronting the Populist Challenge in Western Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape in the West is currently marked by a significant divide between technocracy and populism, a fault line that does not align neatly with traditional conservative and liberal ideologies. This article explores four strategies that liberals and technocrats can employ to address the populist challenge.\n\n1. Passive Resistance:\nOne approach is to wait for populism to falter on its own. Given the stigmatization of populist ideas by technocratic liberalism, it is possible that the incompetence of populist leaders will become apparent, leading to their removal from office. This strategy relies on the assumption that the populist movement's failures will serve as a lesson, discouraging future attempts at similar political movements.\n\n2. Triangulation:\nAnother strategy is to adapt liberalism to accommodate some populist concerns. This approach involves compromising on certain issues to preserve democracy, such as accepting trade barriers as a result of the democratic process or slowing down the rate of immigration to maintain a core national culture.\n\n3. Brinksmanship:\nA third strategy is to assimilate the worst aspects of populism in order to counteract it. This approach involves taking extreme measures, such as ignoring democratic verdicts, delegitimizing elections, or leveraging digital platforms to control information, in the name of preserving liberalism.\n\n4. Democratic Triangulation:\nThe final strategy is democratic triangulation, which involves finding common ground between liberal and populist ideologies. This strategy involves taking populist concerns seriously and addressing them in a way that preserves democratic values and promotes compromise.\n\nEach strategy carries its own risks, and their applicability varies. For instance, the Brexit cause, initially led by a pro-EU prime minister, has faced difficulties, while populist leaders in Poland have presided over periods of economic growth and increased popularity. The success of these strategies remains to be seen, and the future of Western politics remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Trump's Vice Presidential Pick Mike Pence Holds Opposing Views on Key Issues with Presidential Nominee Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has held opposing views on trade, Russia, Iraq, and Muslims compared to the billionaire businessman. Throughout his 16-year political career, the 57-year-old Indiana governor has adhered to traditionally muscular Republican policies on foreign affairs.\n\nTrump, however, has taken a more isolationist approach and placed less emphasis on foreign issues. The issues that he has put at the center of his campaign are largely the ones he and his running mate disagree on.\n\nTrump made his opposition to the Iraq intervention a major theme, criticizing Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her 2002 vote backing the war when she was in the Senate. Pence, near the beginning of his 12-year tenure in the U.S. House, voted for the resolution authorizing the 2003 Iraq invasion as well.\n\nPence, who chaired the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East, was also a prominent backer of the 2007 \"surge\" strategy sending more U.S. troops to the faltering effort in Iraq, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer at the time that \"the surge is working\" while also defending the original decision to invade despite the absence of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nPence has also struck a harder line on Russia than Trump, whose authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has praised. Trump asked an audience at a California rally in May, \"Wouldn't it be nice if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice?\" Pence has opted for stronger rhetoric, telling the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2015 that \"A new Iron Curtain is descending down the spine of Europe as modern Russia seeks to redraw the map of Europe by force.\"\n\nHe added, \"Putin's Russia ignores talk of sanctions, claims land and supports rebels in Ukraine with impunity.\" Pence has previously taken issue with some of Trump's national security proposals, calling his proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the U.S. \"offensive and unconstitutional\" in a December tweet.\n\nTrump has since refined the proposal, saying it would only apply to citizens from countries with connections to terrorism. Perhaps more than any other international issue, Trump has made global trade a defining aspect of his campaign -- yet Pence has taken a diametrically opposed position.\n\nThe real estate mogul has frequently called NAFTA, which regulates trade between U.S., Canada, and Mexico, \"a disaster.\" During a Republican primary debate in February, he declared, \"We are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.\"\n\nPence, in contrast, praised the role of global trade and slammed protectionism in a 2010 speech to the Detroit Economic Club. \"Protectionism and closing our doors to other countries does not help us, or people in the rest of the world,\" he said. \"We must support expanded free trade to renew American exceptionalism and create jobs.\"\n\nPence also backed free trade deals with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea while in Congress. Potentially most problematic for Trump, Pence has been a strong proponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade deal involving 12 countries pushed by the Obama administration.\n\n\"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country -- just a continuing rape of our country,\" Trump said in a speech last month in Ohio. But in a September 2014 tweet, Pence gave the deal a ringing endorsement and called for its \"swift adoption.\"\n\nHowever, the Indiana governor has found common ground with Trump on some national security issues -- especially when it comes to criticizing President Barack Obama. Like Trump, Pence has slammed Obama for reductions in the size of the American military.\n\n\"This administration has reduced our Army, now its smallest size since 1940. The Navy has fewer ships than at any time since 1916, and our Air Force has its smallest tactical fighter force in history,\" Pence said at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nTrump made similar statements in an April foreign policy address. \"Our active-duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Indiana governor has also echoed Trump's critique of the President's preferred terminology for terrorist groups. \"Lecturing the American people about the crusades while refusing to call Islamic extremism by name is an abdication of leadership,\" Pence told CPAC.\n\nPence is an avid backer of the Middle Eastern ally, telling the CPAC audience, \"Israel's cause is our cause\" and voicing approval of the decision by then-House Speaker John Boehner to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal the White House was then negotiating with Tehran.\n\nTrump has also blasted the deal, and has recently staked out an aggressively pro-Israel stance. \"Israel is a very, very important ally of the United States and we are going to protect them 100%,\" he said last week, rebuffing an audience member's criticism of the country.\n\nBut last winter, Trump was castigated by many Republicans for declining to promise to keep Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel. He also said peace would depend on whether Israel is willing to make sacrifices and that he would remain \"neutral\" in negotiations.",
    " Title: Romney's Transition Team Plots Modest Accomplishments for Potential Presidency, Focuses on Fiscal Reform and Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's transition team, known as the \"Readiness Project,\" is intensifying its activities as the nominee gains ground in the polls. The team is planning a series of modest but swift accomplishments should Romney win the presidency, while taking care to avoid over-promising due to the narrow Republican majority in Congress.\n\nThe team's focus will be felt most immediately on health reform, with Romney's promise to \"repeal Obamacare\" likely to be tempered, even with a Republican Senate. According to one official, under a Democratic Senate, the team would aim to make changes to Obamacare through regulatory measures.\n\nRomney's team, working out of government-issued emails and office space on C Street Southwest, is calling its opening legislative agenda a \"200-day plan\" rather than the traditional 100-day plan of President John F. Kennedy, due to the current political climate making it difficult to promise much in three months.\n\nThe team is not planning an ideological crusade, but rather positioning Romney as a problem solver, primarily on economic issues. One Republican official who frequently speaks with top campaign aides said Romney's presidency will be focused on removing barriers to economic growth and providing certainty to businesses on taxes and regulation.\n\nAlready, Romney aides acknowledge they have promised more than they can deliver. Talk of immigration reform in the first year, a Romney promise from the second presidential debate, has caused aides to express skepticism.\n\nHowever, conservatives do expect Romney to make a few changes by executive decree in the first 48 hours if he is elected president. Among these changes are re-implementing the \"Mexico City policy\" that prohibits federally funded nongovernmental organizations from promoting or performing abortions and issuing waivers to states that do not wish to participate in elements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for a Romney administration, according to the aides, will be keeping conservative lawmakers happy while dealing with the nation's fiscal emergency, an issue that is likely to alienate the conservative wing of House Republicans resistant to raising revenues, despite their leaders recognizing it as a mathematical necessity.",
    " Title: Republican Jeb Bush Aims for $100 Million in Funding for SuperPAC by June 1\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush is aiming to raise $100 million for the Right to Rise SuperPAC by June 1. This fundraising goal mirrors the high-end price tag for luxury penthouses in Manhattan and the amount donated by conservative businessman David Koch and Hollywood mogul David Geffen to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nBush has been actively fundraising since January, hosting private dinners with millionaires and billionaires. As a non-candidate, he is legally allowed to engage in heavy-lifting fundraising for the superPAC, as he has not yet declared his presidential candidacy.\n\nThe lack of a formal campaign committee allows Bush to bypass contribution limits, as he would be subject to a maximum contribution of $2,700 per donor if he were an official candidate. The superPAC, however, can accept unlimited contributions.\n\nAnother radical development is the potential for campaigns to outsource their advertising efforts to designated superPACs, a practice that is currently under speculation, particularly in Bush's campaign. While superPACs are not allowed to coordinate messages with the candidate's campaign committee, this outsourcing could blur the lines between the two entities.\n\nDan Backer, a conservative campaign finance lawyer, downplayed the role of superPACs, stating, \"They probably have relationships with the candidates that they're ultimately going to support, but they are distinct legal entities\u2014and very intentionally so.\"\n\nHowever, Michael Malbin, director of the Campaign Finance Institute, expressed concern about the growing closeness between superPACs and federal candidates and elected officials. He predicted that this relationship could lead to situations where candidates solicit and extort large amounts of money from donors.\n\nMalbin compared the current era of unlimited campaign contributions to previous periods in U.S. history when presidential candidates were able to solicit unlimited campaign cash, such as the 1890s and 1900s, the early 1970s, and the \"soft money\" period of the 1990s. Each of these eras closed with the enactment of new laws regulating political money.",
    " Title: House Votes to Fund Government Through Mid-December, Conditional on Defunding ObamaCare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted on Friday to keep the government open through mid-December, but only if Congress removes funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare. The current funding for the government is set to expire at the end of the month, and lawmakers must approve the stopgap bill to keep Washington functioning.\n\nThe GOP measure would fund the government through Dec. 15 at current funding levels. Representative John Culberson (R-Texas) stated on the House floor, \"Today, the constitutional conservatives in the House are keeping their word to our constituents and our nation to stand true to our principles, to protect them from the most unpopular law ever passed in the history of the country- ObamaCare- that intrudes on their privacy and our most sacred right as Americans to be left alone.\"\n\nThe vote sets the stage for a showdown next week in the Democratic-led Senate. Realistically, the chance of the measure surviving a Senate vote is slim to none. One Senate Democrat has already announced the bill as dead on arrival and called Friday's vote a \"waste of time.\"\n\nRepublican leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner, have argued that the Affordable Care Act is unpopular and negatively impacting businesses. Boehner stated at a noon rally on Capitol Hill, \"You've got businesses all over the country who are not hiring because of the impact of this law. You've got other businesses who are reducing the hours for their employees because of this law.\"\n\nThe House measure would replace ObamaCare with a plan that expands tax breaks for Americans who buy their own insurance, setting the stage for a showdown with Senate Democrats that could push the government toward a partial shutdown at the end of the month. More than 140 congressional Republicans have signed on to the bill to keep the government running at existing funding levels and delay the health care law.\n\nDemocrats have vowed to oppose the bill, warning that the strategy risks a government shutdown with funding set to expire by Oct. 1. Under the proposal, Americans who purchase coverage through state-run exchanges can claim a $7,500 deduction against their income and payroll taxes, regardless of the cost of the insurance. Families could deduct $20,000. The plan also increases government funding for high-risk pools.\n\nInternal divisions have plagued Republicans this year as they struggle to produce alternatives to the Obama plan. Legislation backed by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to increase funding for high-risk pools was pulled without a vote after some conservatives objected to improving ObamaCare at a time when they want to repeal it. Obama and Democrats frequently criticize Republicans for focusing so much attention on repeal efforts without coming up with an alternative.\n\nAs of now, it remains unclear whether the Senate will strip the health law provision from the continuing resolution, and if the House Republicans will stand firm and hold their ground in the face of potential opposition from the Senate.",
    " Title: Facebook Announces Ban on Deepfakes with Caveats and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook, a leading social media platform, announced on Monday that it will ban certain types of deepfakes - videos manipulated to make it appear as though individuals are doing or saying things they did not. This policy marks Facebook's first attempt at regulating deepfakes, but it comes with caveats.\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, Facebook Vice President Monika Bickert stated that the ban will not apply to \"parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words.\" The company's moderators will remove videos edited through artificial intelligence or machine learning \"in ways that are not apparent to an average person and would likely mislead\" viewers. Bickert did not elaborate on how the company would assess an average person's understanding of altered videos.\n\nThe new policy has drawn criticism, with some arguing that it would not have barred a well-known recent example of an altered video that went viral. In May, a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi edited to make it seem as though she were slurring her words while speaking at a public event was viewed millions of times.\n\nRepresentative Jennifer Wexton, a Democrat from Virginia, criticized Facebook's policy on Twitter, stating, \"Call it what you want\u2014deepfake or cheapfake\u2014it\u2019s still disinformation and @ Facebook needs to do more to stop it from spreading.\"\n\nJason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents digital publishers, expressed concern about the speed at which viral videos spread, stating, \"We're entirely at risk here in letting Facebook turn this into a censorship debate while ignoring the fact these videos only receive their velocity and reach due to Facebook's algorithm and recommendations not because they're simply allowed to exist.\"\n\nKint also criticized the timing of Facebook's announcement, noting that Bickert is scheduled to appear before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Wednesday.\n\nSaniat Sohrawardi, a researcher who studies deepfakes and methods used to identify them, echoed Kint's concern about the speed with which viral videos move. Sohrawardi stated, \"There are not any very reliable ways to detect the fakes yet, at least none published that would be good for open-world detection.\"\n\nSohrawardi also noted that when technology to effectively detect deepfakes is created, the fight against them will have only just begun. \"If we create a good enough detector and it gets popular enough that everybody knows about it, including the attackers, they will theoretically be able to create better fakes using that machine learning,\" said Sohrawardi.",
    " Title: Can the U.S. Government Quarantine Individuals Against Their Will? Due Process Requirements Explained\n\nArticle:\n\nThe question of whether the U.S. government, or state governments, can enforce quarantines against individuals' will, ostensibly for public health and safety, is a complex issue that requires an analysis of both federal and state powers. As local and regional governments derive their powers from the states in which they are located, this analysis pertains to them as well.\n\nThe fundamental premise is that freedom is the default position in a free society. The Declaration of Independence, as well as various amendments in the Bill of Rights, unambiguously reflects the view that our rights\u2014to think, speak, publish, worship, defend ourselves, travel, own property, and be left alone\u2014are natural to our humanity. These rights preexist the government, and their source is our humanity, not the government. The government's primary purpose, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, is to protect these rights.\n\nThough the courts have interpreted the Constitution to possess lamentable exceptions, the framers and ratifiers arguably accepted the non-aggression principle, which declares that all aggression against persons and property, even by government, is immoral. In the case of the federal government, it is one of limited, delegated powers.\n\nThe states formed the federal government, and not the other way around. However, today, the federal government maintains power by bribing the states with cash grants, the rich with bailouts, the middle class with tax breaks, and the poor with transfer payments.\n\nDespite this, the courts continue to recognize the concept of personal liberty in a free society. All this is background to the issue lurking beneath the headlines this week: Can the government quarantine people without proof of contagion and imminent assault? The short answer is no.\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment, if any government\u2014state or federal\u2014wants to impair the life, liberty, or property of any person, it must follow due process. The substantive component asks if the impairment of liberty is proper to the government that seeks the impairment, and the procedural component asks if the impairment has come about fairly.\n\nIn a public health crisis, there are no emergency provisions or triggers in the Constitution; yet, Congress has given itself the power to regulate public health and safety under various pretexts. The pretexts exist because the nanny state urge of members of Congress to regulate is confronted by the reservation in the Tenth Amendment of health and safety to the states. Those pretexts are regulating commerce and all that affects commerce, and paying the states to do Congress' will.\n\nStated differently, the Supreme Court has ruled that both the federal government and the states can confine a person who has not committed a crime, or one who has but has served one's full sentence, in order to protect society from the person's intentional or uncontrollable harmful tendencies.\n\nHowever, it is contrary to the plain meaning of the Constitution for Congress to give itself powers that were not delegated to it by the Constitution, but the courts have permitted this. Yet, even in the case of a lunatic who has committed a crime and served his full sentence but remains dangerous, the courts have recognized constitutional safeguards to protect his natural rights.\n\nNow, back to our question of whether the government\u2014state or federal\u2014can confine persons against their will in order to protect public health. The short answer is yes, but the Constitution requires procedural due process. Thus, a government-ordered quarantine of all persons in a city block or a postal zip code or a telephone area code would be an egregious violation of due process, both substantively and procedurally.\n\nSubstantively, no government in America has the lawful power to curtail natural rights by decree. Procedurally, notwithstanding the fear of disease contagion, the states and feds may only quarantine those who are actively contagious and will infect others imminently. And it must present evidence of both at a trial at which it bears the burden of proof.\n\nWhile the non-aggression principle permits offensive aggression in self-defense when an attack is imminent and certain, that is a high standard for the government to meet, as it should be. Freedom\u2014even the freedom of a madman or a dangerously sick and contagious person\u2014is the default position. Infringing upon it without procedural due process is always constitutionally impermissible.\n\nThe Constitution was not written for the government to right every wrong. We know that government itself causes most wrongs\u2014the theft of property by taxation, the impairment of economic liberty by regulation, the slaughter of innocents by war, the infringement of expressive liberties by majority vote. Yet, the Constitution still mandates an exacting due process for all whom the government would restrain.\n\nThat means a trial before any quarantine, no matter the public danger, and a fair trial, not one animated by mass hysteria or government-generated fear.",
    " Title: CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman Resigns, Cites Prioritization of Financial Companies Over Consumers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) student loan ombudsman, Seth Frotman, has resigned, citing the agency's leadership prioritizing powerful financial companies over consumers, according to a report by National Public Radio (NPR) on Monday. In his official resignation letter, Frotman stated that the CFPB's leadership has \"turned its back on young people and their financial futures.\"\n\nFrotman, who served as the student loan ombudsman for the past three years, led the agency's Office for Students and Young Consumers. In this role, he evaluated thousands of complaints from student borrowers and reviewed questionable practices from private lenders, loan services, and debt collectors.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) tweeted that the administration's actions are \"shameful.\" He stated, \"The Trump Administration has forced another cop from the beat when it comes to protecting students from predatory #4profit colleges, loan servicers, and repayment scams.\"\n\nThe CFPB has reviewed over 60,000 student loan complaints and returned over $750 million to aggrieved borrowers since 2011, according to NPR. However, the office has changed under the Trump administration. For example, in August 2017, the Department of Education announced it would no longer share information with the CFPB regarding its review of federal student loans.\n\nFrotman's resignation comes as the Department of Education continues to propose changes regarding aid meant for defrauded students. In December 2017, the Department of Education announced new rules for providing aid to students who said they were defrauded by their colleges. The new system would limit some student loan refunds by tying it to their income.\n\nIn May, The New York Times reported that the Education Department had largely dismantled a team charged with investigating abuses by for-profit colleges. Frotman's resignation letter, as reported by NPR, states, \"The Bureau's current leadership folded to political pressure...and failed borrowers who depend on independent oversight to halt bad practices.\"",
    " Title: Early Voting Reshapes Presidential Election Landscape in Iowa and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Des Moines, Iowa, voters began casting their ballots on Thursday, marking the start of early voting in the state. This trend is not confined to Iowa, as waves of absentee ballots have already started arriving in mailboxes in 30 other states. The presidential election is no longer a fixed-date event, but rather an item on the fall checklist, a civic duty that is increasingly becoming part of everyday life.\n\nThe rise of early voting is changing the dynamics of how Americans elect their presidents. Candidates are no longer as focused on winning more votes on Election Day, but on executing a plan to accumulate more votes over the next 40 days. For millions of Americans, the election is becoming Election Month, with as much as 40 percent of the electorate expected to vote early this year, including voters in crucial swing states such as Ohio, Florida, Colorado, and others.\n\nJim Messina, the campaign manager for President Obama, has built the president's re-election strategy around the growing trend of early voting. In a close election, he stated, early voting can significantly increase the number of votes. The Obama campaign is actively encouraging early voting, with the president himself delivering speeches urging voters to start voting early.\n\nIn Iowa, Democrats have requested temporary voting locations, such as La Tapatia Tienda Mexicana, a restaurant, and Johnston Evangelical Free Church. Election officials have granted these requests, along with those for voting sites at libraries, grocery stores, and community centers.\n\nWhile some people will vote in person, more will do so by mail. In Iowa, Democrats have a significant edge over Republicans in the number of absentee ballots requested statewide, but Republicans expect the numbers to level out over the next five weeks.\n\nThe proportion of people nationwide casting early ballots has increased from 23 percent in 2004 to 31 percent in 2008, according to Michael McDonald, who studies early voting at George Mason University. This year, party strategists estimate that up to 40 percent of voters will cast ballots before Nov. 6, but the proportion is far higher in many battleground states.\n\nIn Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, and Nevada, advisers to both campaigns say as many as 70 percent of ballots will be cast before Nov. 6. In Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa, the campaigns estimate at least 30 percent of people will vote early. Virginia and New Hampshire are the only battleground states without widespread, no-excuse early voting.\n\nRepublican officials in several states acknowledge that the Obama campaign may start with a slight advantage in early voting due to Democrats' greater familiarity with early voting. To level the playing field, the Republican secretary of state in Ohio sent absentee ballot requests to every registered voter in the state.\n\nAs the early voting period progresses, both campaigns are deploying resources to maximize turnout and find voters through exhaustive micro-targeting. The Obama campaign is using hundreds of field organizers and volunteers to \"chase ballots,\" or return envelopes to county election offices. The Republican Party is sending a mailing to all of its voters, urging them to request an absentee ballot and vote before Election Day.\n\nAs the election approaches, the race remains tight, and both campaigns are working to secure every possible vote. The early voting trend is reshaping campaigns, with Election Day becoming Election Month for a significant portion of the electorate. The outcome of the election will depend on which campaign can most effectively execute their early voting strategy.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Endorses Donald Trump for Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie has endorsed Donald Trump for the presidential race, marking a significant shift in the political landscape. The announcement was made in a press conference in Texas on Friday.\n\nTrump, in his usual casual manner, dismissed the importance of endorsements, stating, \"I could have had quite a few good ones. This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.\" He praised Christie as an outstanding man with an outstanding family.\n\nThe endorsement comes after a series of attacks on Trump by Christie during the Republican debates, most notably in the debate before the New Hampshire primary where he labeled Trump as a \"robot.\" However, Christie's endorsement may not be a complete surprise, as he had been contemplating further involvement in the race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn a joint press conference, Christie and Trump traded places at the podium, reminiscent of tag-team WWE wrestlers. Christie explained that he and his family decided to support Trump as the candidate who could provide the best leadership for America and ensure that Hillary Clinton does not come close to the White House.\n\nDespite their past criticisms of each other, Trump and Christie have found common ground in their shared disdain for Marco Rubio, who gained media attention after the latest debate. Christie, who has not been involved in vice presidential talks yet, stated, \"Turn away from the amateur acts from Washington, D.C. and turn toward a strong leader. That's who this is.\"\n\nThe endorsement comes amidst speculation about the two's rocky relationship in the past. In August, Christie compared Trump's campaign to that of Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann. He also stated in an interview with Greta Van Susteren that Trump doesn't have the temperament or experience for the presidency. Similarly, Trump had criticized Christie over the Bridgegate scandal.\n\nHowever, today, the two appeared united, possibly motivated by their shared dislike for Rubio, who has been the focus of media attention after the latest debate. Christie, when asked about Rubio's attack lines, responded, \"Desperate people do desperate things.\"\n\nThe endorsement marks a significant development in the presidential race, as Christie brings with him a list of donor emails and supporters, which he sold to Rubio this morning. The endorsement could potentially strengthen Trump's position in the race, as Christie's endorsement could sway undecided voters and provide Trump with a boost in the upcoming primaries.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Political Homogeneity Among Elite College Faculty\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by Brooklyn College professor Mitchell Langbert, titled \"Homogeneous: The Political Affiliations of Elite Liberal Arts College Faculty,\" has highlighted a significant political imbalance among faculty members at top-ranked liberal arts colleges in the United States. The study, published by Academic Questions, an organization fighting leftist propaganda in academia, reveals that 39 percent of the colleges in the sample have zero registered Republicans on their faculties, and 78 percent of academic departments have no Republican members or so few as to make no difference.\n\nThe study examines the political affiliation of Ph.D.-holding faculty members at 51 of the 66 top-ranked liberal arts colleges according to U.S. News & World Report. The findings show a clear dominance of Democrats among faculty members. For instance, engineering departments have 1.6 Democrats for every Republican, while chemistry and economics departments have about 5.5 Democrats for every Republican. The situation is particularly severe in anthropology departments, with a Democrat-to-Republican faculty ratio of 133-to-1, and in communications departments, with a ratio of 108-to-0.\n\nLangbert notes that he could not find a single Republican with an exclusive appointment to fields like gender studies, Africana studies, and peace studies.\n\nThe study also reveals extreme Democrat-to-Republican faculty ratios at some of the most elite colleges. At Williams College, the ratio is 132-to-1, at Amherst College, it's 34-to-1, at Wellesley, it's 136-to-1, at Swarthmore, it's 120-to-1, and at Claremont McKenna, it's 4-to-1. Only two colleges of the top 66 on U.S. News & World Report's 2017 list have a modicum of equality in numbers between Democratic and Republican faculty members. They are the U.S. Military Academy, aka West Point, with a Democrat-to-Republican ratio of 1.3-to-1, and the U.S. Naval Academy, whose ratio is 2.3-to-1.\n\nThe study also suggests that many professors spend class time indoctrinating students with their views, which can be described as leftist, socialist, or communist. This is a cowardly act for a professor to take advantage of student immaturity by indoctrinating pupils with his opinions before the students have developed the maturity and skill to examine other opinions. It is also a dereliction of duty of college administrators and boards of trustees to permit the continuance of what some professors and students are doing in the name of higher education.\n\nThe study's findings suggest biases in college research and academic policy, where leftist political homogeneity is embedded in the college culture. The leftist bias at most of the nation's colleges is in stark contrast to the political leanings of the nation, as most Americans identify as conservative, according to a number of Pew Research Center surveys. These Americans are seeing their tax dollars and tuition dollars going to people who have contempt for their values and seek to indoctrinate their children with leftist ideas.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Health Care Law Defines Individual Mandate as Tax, Provides Political Victory for Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday declared President Obama's signature health care law a constitutional tax, providing a political victory for the president as he campaigns for re-election. The decision validates the president's decision to prioritize the legislation during a time of economic turmoil in 2009, a move that contributed to the Democrats' loss of House control in 2010.\n\nDemocrats celebrated the decision, although President Obama and some others tried to downplay the political benefits. \"I know there will be a lot of discussion today about the politics of all this\u2014about who won and who lost,\" Mr. Obama said, adding that such talk \"completely misses the point\" of the law's benefits.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, argued that the ruling leaves in place 21 tax increases in the health care law, costing over $675 billion over the next 10 years. Of these, 12 tax hikes would affect families earning less than $250,000 per year, according to the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThe high court's ruling was a significant win for Mr. Obama, who has been campaigning on the health care law as a major achievement of his presidency. If the justices had overturned the law or key portions of it, Mr. Obama would have been portrayed as having wasted his term on a demonstrably failed policy.\n\nThe ruling also sparked a flurry of political activity, with both President Obama and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney engaging in dueling news conferences within two hours of the decision. Mr. Romney, who has pledged to repeal the law if elected, criticized the law as \"bad policy\" and promised to repeal it if he is elected.\n\nThe Romney campaign reported raising about $1 million in the first three hours after the decision was announced, while the Obama campaign sent out a fundraising email to supporters before the ruling was made public. However, an Obama for America spokeswoman said later that the campaign does not give out specifics on fundraising except at filing time.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision leaves the political landscape of the upcoming election uncertain, with both sides claiming victory and using the ruling to rally their bases. The ruling's impact on the election remains to be seen.",
    " Title: CBO Warns of Doubling Federal Debt by 2037, Urges Bipartisan Action\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has issued a report stating that the federal debt will likely double by the middle of the next decade and reach more than twice the size of the entire U.S. economy by 2037, unless Congress takes action on taxes and spending. This is the worst fiscal outlook since a brief period during World War II, according to the nonpartisan agency.\n\nThe CBO attributes the growing debt to an aging population requiring increased spending on healthcare and higher interest payments on the debt. The federal debt held by the public will be equal to 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of this fiscal year, up from 40 percent at the end of 2008. By 2037, it is projected to exceed 200 percent of GDP.\n\nThe CBO's report suggests that deep deficits and debt do not have to occur. If Congress implements major tax increases and deep spending cuts already built into the law, debt would begin to shrink almost immediately. However, these tax increases and spending cuts have proven unpalatable on both sides of the aisle.\n\nPolitical leaders have offered differing perspectives on the issue. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) criticized the current policies, stating, \"The president\u2019s policies are not working. The sobering reality of our economic challenges require leadership and action. The president and his party\u2019s leaders have failed on both counts.\"\n\nOn the other hand, House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-MD) emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation, saying, \"The CBO\u2019s report is a warning that we must get our fiscal house in order by achieving big and balanced deficit reduction that includes both spending and revenues.\"\n\nIn response to the CBO's report, a bipartisan group of senators has shown signs of cooperation, meeting behind closed doors to discuss the country's fiscal situation in light of the European debt crisis. The senators emerged from the meeting expressing a new sense of urgency about the country's fiscal picture.\n\nThe CBO's analysis presents two sets of numbers, one assuming certain tax increases and spending cuts take effect, and another assuming they are delayed. Under the former scenario, debt decreases, while under the latter, debt explodes, leading to a 4.4 percent lower economy in 2027 and a 13.4 percent lower economy in 2037.\n\nThe CBO's analysis also provides insights into the future of the budget and the economy, including predictions about the U.S. population reaching 389 million in 2037 and surpassing 500 million by 2087, with the population skewing older. Older workers are expected to work fewer hours, and the growth in the labor force will slow, keeping economic growth to an average of 2.2 percent over the long term. The interest rate on debt will be higher, at an average of 2.7 percent, a reversal from recent years when economic growth and interest rates were about the same.\n\nFor each dollar the deficit rises, national savings are reduced by between 32 cents and 72 cents, and domestic investment is reduced by between 10 cents and 50 cents, according to the CBO.",
    " Title: Political Implications of Obamacare Emerge as Economic Concerns Persist\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has been a topic of debate in the political arena since its inception in 2010. While the economic implications of the costly national health care plan have been a point of contention, the political implications are now gaining attention.\n\nInitially, health care reform was not typically viewed as a political strategy, with terms such as \"accessibility\" and \"affordability\" used to demonstrate commitment to quality health care for all Americans. However, the signing of the act into law on March 23, 2010, emboldened Democrats, and the political strategy shifted from rhetoric to action.\n\nThe political language surrounding Obamacare still emphasized \"accessibility\" and \"affordability,\" but also included terms like \"protection\" (of Americans, as well as Medicare and Medicaid) and \"fairness\" (to reduce inequalities in the system). Various demographic groups, including seniors, minorities, liberals, and women, were initially targeted. Over time, the underlying political message was sold on a wider basis to all Americans.\n\nCritics argue that Obamacare will reportedly cost taxpayers $1 trillion and will be a financial burden for future generations. It is expected to increase government influence over health care, reduce consumer choice, and potentially lead to the loss of an estimated 80,000 jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The extensive phase-in period between 2014 and 2020 will serve as a constant source of confusion, and businesses may struggle under the weight of the 2,700-page document.\n\nRepublican opposition to Obamacare has been significant, with a Reuters-Ipsos poll in June 2012 showing 56 percent of Americans surveyed were against it. However, the general consensus was that Obamacare would not adequately fix health care, and that real reform was necessary.\n\nIn a surprising move, 19 Republican governors in mostly red states have decided not to establish their own health care exchanges, opting instead to let the federal government manage them. This strategy could potentially empower the federal government at the expense of the states and could be used as a political tactic to blame the White House for forcing the issue.\n\nThe political implications of this decision remain to be seen, but some speculate it could lead to moderate Republicans using the non-exchange exchange to distinguish themselves from more vocal conservative Republicans and Tea Party supporters. Critics argue that maintaining radio silence about Obamacare could backfire, as the economic cost of implementing it will be significant, and the economic and political costs of doing nothing could be immense.\n\nAs the political battle over Obamacare continues, it is crucial for both parties to consider the long-term economic and political implications of their actions.",
    " Title: Uninsured Population in the U.S. Remains Significant Despite ACA, Disparities Wide Among Low-Income and Minority Groups\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed American Health Care Act, the focus has shifted back to the real effects of health reform in the United States. In a new book, \"An American Sickness,\" journalist Elisabeth Rosenthal laments the transformation of the U.S. healthcare system from a patient care system to a multitrillion-dollar business.\n\nOne major issue highlighted by Rosenthal is the persistence of an uninsured population in the U.S., which is nearly as large as the population of Canada. Since 2013, the number of uninsured Americans has decreased from 18 percent in 2013 to 11.9 percent in 2016, but there are still nearly 30 million people living in America without health insurance.\n\n\"When you look at it from the perspective of much of the rest of the developed world \u2014 to have 10 percent of the population without good access to health care shows how far we still have to go,\" said Rosenthal, a doctor, former New York Times writer, and now the editor in chief of the nonprofit Kaiser Health News.\n\nThe size of the uninsured group is well-known, but less clear is what this group looks like. A new series in the Lancet on health inequality paints a clearer picture. People who go without insurance in America are not refusing coverage for ideological reasons; they simply cannot afford to pay.\n\nMost uninsured Americans have yearly incomes that are near or below the poverty line ($11,770 for an individual in 2016). \"Among non-elderly adults, 7.6% of the non-poor were uninsured in 2015 compared with 25.2% of the poor and 24.1% of the near-poor,\" the Lancet reports. In other words, the poor and near-poor were more than three times more likely to be uninsured than their higher-income counterparts.\n\nThe other group that is less likely to be insured are people of color, according to the Lancet. \"With respect to racial disparities, in 2015 the uninsurance rate among adults aged 18\u201364 years remained far higher for Hispanics (27.7%) and non-Hispanic blacks (14.4%) than for non-Hispanic whites (8.7%),\" the Lancet reports.\n\nThe disparities in access to care are wider in the U.S. than in other developed countries. \"Before the 2010 passage of the ACA, which progressively expanded health insurance coverage, 39% of Americans with below-average income reported not seeing a doctor for a medical problem because of cost, compared with 7% of low-income Canadians and 1% of those in the UK,\" the Lancet reports. They are also linked to a big mortality gap: The richest 1 percent in America live up to 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent.\n\nThe Lancet researchers do not think the kind of market-based reforms the GOP is pushing are the solution to the problem, and point out they will make inequality worse. Instead, they are siding with a certain American champion of universal health care: \"A single-payer, Medicare-for-all reform \u2014 championed by Senator Bernie Sanders during his upstart presidential campaign, as well as by many physicians and the nation's largest nurses union \u2014 would, in our view, best address health-care inequalities.\"\n\nRosenthal is more of an incrementalist. She does not think blowing up the system is realistic. \"This system progressively got built one action at a time, the perversion of one incentive at a time,\" she said. To bring the U.S. more in line with other wealthy countries \u2014 in terms of both cost and access \u2014 she thinks we need to unravel those perverse incentives, one small step at a time.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Aide George Papadopoulos Sentenced to 14 Days in Prison for Lying to FBI\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, was sentenced to 14 days in federal prison on Friday for lying to the FBI during the early stages of the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In an interview on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, Papadopoulos stated that he felt \"pinned\" during his interview with FBI officers in January 2017 and lied to investigators in an attempt to protect President Donald Trump.\n\nPapadopoulos explained that he was attending parties with senior-level transition officials at the time of his interview, and he understood that there was an incipient investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He expressed that he found himself in a difficult position, as he had worked hard to help elect Trump, and then found himself potentially incriminating the sitting president.\n\nReports have indicated that statements by Papadopoulos to an Australian official in May 2016 triggered the initial investigation into Russian interference in the election. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his meetings in London with a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, making him the first person to admit guilt to Robert Mueller in the special counsel's sprawling Russia inquiry.\n\nPapadopoulos described Mifsud as a well-connected individual who claimed to be able to connect him and the campaign to Russian officials and other leaders around the world. Mifsud told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 that he had obtained \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, and would claim to have amassed troves of emails connected to Clinton's campaign. A month before that meeting, the emails of Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, were stolen in a data breach.\n\nPapadopoulos maintained that he was not made aware of the hacks on Podesta or the Democratic National Committee and has testified that he did not tell any Trump campaign officials about his conversation with Mifsud regarding Clinton's emails. Papadopoulos stated that he chose to keep the professor's claim under wraps because Paul Manafort, who became the Trump campaign chairman in May 2016, quashed the idea of a potential summit between then-candidate Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, which Papadopoulos had been trying to broker.\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated on Sunday that it was unlikely that Papadopoulos did not tell other members of the Trump campaign about his talks with Mifsud. Warner added that it was implausible that, if Papadopoulos had this knowledge and wanted to try to further ingratiate himself with the campaign, he would not have shared that information with someone on the campaign.\n\nPapadopoulos also stated that he had \"no opinion on\" and \"no knowledge of\" Trump's alleged attempts to obstruct Mueller's investigation and could not answer whether the special counsel would be able to demonstrate coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Delegate Challenges as Cruz Outmaneuvers in Delegate Selection Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Republican presidential race, Donald Trump is facing challenges in the delegate selection process as his campaign attacks his own party for what he perceives as a rigged nominating process. The billionaire businessman has been criticized for missing critical deadlines and being outmaneuvered by the Ted Cruz campaign, according to frustrated party leaders.\n\nAt a CNN town hall on Tuesday, Trump stated that he knows the rules \"very well\" but that the rules are \"stacked\" against him by the establishment. This prompted a cutting retort from Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.\n\nThe dispute over process is building as Cruz's operation has proved more adroit lately in getting supporters elected as the actual delegates who will attend July's convention. Last weekend at the Colorado state convention, Cruz gained all 34 delegates to this summer's convention in Cleveland. On the sidelines, he's also working to get allies elected as delegates in states that hold traditional primaries and caucuses that allocate delegates based on voting.\n\nIn those states, delegates \"bound\" to Trump or Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich would have to vote for their respective candidates on the first ballot at the convention. However, if there's an open convention \u2013 meaning nobody has the necessary 1,237 delegate to clinch the nomination \u2013 Cruz is banking on his delegate allies to surge over to his side on a second ballot, which many would be allowed to do.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Wednesday that based on their own analysis, Cruz could pick up at least 130 \u2013 and as many as 170 or more \u2013 additional delegate votes on the second ballot at an open convention. This would make it even harder for Trump to lock down the nomination, upping the pressure on the front-runner to clinch the party nod by the final June contests.\n\nThe Trump campaign has insisted they can do this, and that Cruz won't get the opportunity to use his backup delegate allies on a second ballot. However, the Trump campaign has made it harder on itself by missing crucial deadlines in a number of states to lock up delegates who would stay loyal beyond the first ballot.\n\nTrump's team is only now starting to engage in the delegate selection process, the choosing of the actual people who will attend and vote at the convention. Republicans have already selected delegates in at least nine states. In others, such as Virginia and Arizona, the deadline to apply to be a delegate has passed. Indiana's primary, for example, won't take place until next month. However, the deadline to become a national convention delegate was in mid-March. Anti-Trump forces reportedly have already been lining up delegates who would turn on Trump at a contested convention.\n\n\"Are we concerned? Yes, definitely,\" said Tony Samuel, vice chairman of Trump's Indiana campaign. \"Even if [Trump] jumped into high gear, he can't do it,\" said Shak Hill, a Cruz campaign leader in Virginia. \"That's where he's been shut out of the game.\"\n\nTrump is just ramping up his operation, but in some states, he's too late. In Virginia \u2013 a state where Trump won the primary \u2013 he has missed the deadlines to assemble lists of potential delegates. Cruz, however, has delegate candidates in 10 of Virginia's 11 congressional districts.\n\nIndiana's primary is May 3, but 27 of the state's 57 delegates \u2013 the actual people \u2013 have already been selected at congressional district caucuses. The deadline to register as a candidate for delegate was March 15.\n\nIn the at least nine states that have picked some or all of their delegates, Trump has won a total of 100 delegates in primaries and caucuses in these states. In most, however, the candidates had no formal role in selecting the people who will fill those slots.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is banking on rallying popular support \u2013 which so far has kept him far out in front in the Republican field \u2013 in hopes of winning the nomination outright.\n\nDuring a rally in a packed airport hangar in Rome, N.Y., on Tuesday evening, Trump stated, \"Our Republican system is absolutely rigged. It's a phony deal.\" He added, \"These are dirty tricksters.\" He placed the blame on the Republican National Committee, stating, \"They should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen.\"\n\nCruz tore into Trump in a radio interview Tuesday, accusing his rival of being a bully, inciting violence, and using dirty tricks to intimidate voters and delegates. Cruz unloaded on Trump over reports that his supporters were publishing the home addresses of delegates in Colorado and threatening to make public the hotel room numbers of delegates at the convention this summer.\n\n\"That is the tactic of union thugs,\" Cruz told host Glenn Beck. \"That is violence. It is oppressive.\" Cruz conceded that Trump will do well in upcoming primaries, including in Trump's home state of New York next Tuesday. Cruz said he will fare better when the race shifts back west to Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Montana, before finishing in California on June 7.",
    " Title: Former First Lady Laura Bush Condemns Family Separation Policy at U.S.-Mexico Border\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. First Lady Laura Bush has criticized the controversial policy that separates families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border, describing the practice as cruel, immoral, and heart-breaking. In an opinion piece published in the Washington Post, she wrote that the policy is \"cruel, immoral, and breaks my heart.\"\n\nThe policy, which has been a subject of growing controversy, is a result of President Donald Trump's \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy. According to fact-checkers, the policy was introduced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and does not require congressional action to be stopped.\n\nIn a six-week period, there were nearly 2,000 family separations following a crackdown on illegal border crossings. Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points, many planning to seek asylum, are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centers, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents.\n\nLaura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W. Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy. \"This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,\" she wrote in the Washington Post. \"Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert.\"\n\nShe compared the policy to the Japanese American internment camps of World War Two, which are now considered one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. \"These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War Two,\" she added.\n\nEarlier, Mrs. Trump said she \"hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform.\"\n\nThe first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy. On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the U.S. to end what he called its \"unconscionable\" strategy of forced separations.\n\nIn a tweet on Saturday, President Trump urged Democrats to work with Republicans to create new legislation. However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents is the consequence of a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to deter new arrivals. The significant change, analysts say, is the justice department's decision to prosecute parents if they illegally cross the border, even if it is their first offense. The children are not charged with a crime, which means they can not be jailed together.\n\nUntil this policy was announced, such families were usually subject to civil deportation proceedings, which did not require separation. The recent child detentions have resulted in some shelters and foster homes reporting that they are running out of space.\n\nOn Sunday, Democratic lawmakers visited shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, demanding to see detainees. \"They call it zero-tolerance, but a better name for it is zero-humanity. And there is zero logic to this,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who organized a visit to Casa Padre detention center in Brownsville, Texas, told the BBC.\n\nVermont congressman Peter Welch said he saw children held \"in chain link cages\" in a processing facility and one shelter \"filled to capacity.\" Meanwhile, officials announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F).\n\nLocal lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as \"totally inhumane\" and \"outrageous,\" adding, \"It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility.\" Protesters marched to one such tent city in Tornillo, Texas, on Sunday where hundreds of children were being held separately from their parents. They chanted \"Families united!\" and \"Free our children now!\"\n\nThe policy faces legal challenges, including a federal case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The number of families trying to enter the U.S. overland without documentation is on the rise. In the first two weeks of the new \"zero-tolerance\" approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that traveled with them, according to U.S. border officials. In many of the cases, the families have been reunited after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months.\n\nIt is not clear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from traveling. This is because many are fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Honduras and El Salvador, and staying put is often fraught with dangers.",
    " Title: House Republicans Call for Transparency as Schiff Blocks Release of Witness Interviews from Trump-Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of over two dozen House Republicans, led by Representative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), have called on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to stop what they perceive as the withholding of 53 witness interviews from the Trump-Russia probe. In a letter sent on Tuesday, the group expressed concern over the alleged lack of transparency regarding accusations made by public figures, including Schiff, during the investigation.\n\nThe letter states that the American people deserve access to the transcripts of the interviews, as the House Intelligence Committee voted to release them in September 2018. However, the transcripts have yet to be made public, with 43 of the 53 interviews reportedly already declassified. The remaining 10 transcripts are under review by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), with the intention of being reviewed by the White House as part of the declassification process. This review process, according to the Republicans, has been blocked by Schiff.\n\nThe Republicans argue that, despite the delay, they still require access to the material for their ongoing oversight of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation. On Monday, Jordan and Representative Mike Johnson (R-La.) requested that FBI Director Christopher Wray turn over all documents and communications related to the FBI's \"Crossfire Razor\" investigation of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. The request comes in the wake of the release of FBI notes that Republicans have argued prove Flynn was ensnared in a \"perjury trap.\"\n\nThe letter from the Republicans states, \"For almost four years, prominent Democrat politicians and commentators alleged that President Trump colluded with Russia, with Chairman Schiff going as far as to say that he had 'direct evidence' of collusion.\" The letter also mentions that the House Intelligence Committee voted to release the interviews in September 2018, and a spokesperson for the ODNI stated in May 2019 that the review process would be completed \"very soon.\" However, the transcripts have not been made public as of yet.",
    " Title: U.S. and North Korea Establish Direct Communication Channels Amid Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has confirmed for the first time that it is in direct communication with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, during a trip to China's capital, acknowledged that the administration is speaking to North Korea \"directly, through our own channels.\"\n\nTillerson stated, \"We have lines of communication to Pyongyang. We're not in a dark situation, a blackout. We can talk to them. We do talk to them.\" The top U.S. diplomat also mentioned that there are \"three channels\" open with the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nTillerson added that broad sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program \"are beginning to have an effect.\" He noted, \"We are seeing, from what we can observe, and the Chinese are telling us, that it is having some effect.\" Tillerson also highlighted the international community's unified stance against North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nThe situation with Pyongyang is currently described as \"overheated\" by Tillerson, following exchanges of barbs between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Tillerson attributed the rising tensions to North Korea's continued missile testing, stating that if North Korea were to stop testing, \"that would calm things down a lot.\"\n\nU.S. Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert issued a statement Saturday, stating that there are \"several open channels\" for the Trump administration to communicate with the North Korean government. However, North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or ready for talks regarding denuclearization.\n\nTillerson's comments and his visit to Beijing come after North Korea's foreign minister accused the U.S. of declaring war earlier this week. The foreign minister's remarks followed President Trump's threat at the United Nations last week to \"totally destroy\" North Korea if the U.S. has to defend itself or its allies from the regime.\n\nTillerson reiterated in Beijing on Saturday that a nuclear-armed North Korea will never be acceptable to the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. calculated over the summer that Kim Jong Un's regime controlled as many as 60 nuclear weapons, according to an assessment by U.S. intelligence officials. However, some independent experts think the number is far smaller.\n\nAs to the value of negotiating directly with North Korea, opinions among U.S. officials and America's allies vary. While Tillerson says the U.S. is \"directly\" talking with the regime, both Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have stated that now is not the time to engage with the Kim Jong Un's government. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has remained open to such talks.",
    " Title: GOP, Conservative Groups Resist Obama's Call for Debt Ceiling Compromise\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans and conservative groups have rejected President Obama's latest effort to persuade GOP lawmakers to abandon the use of the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for long-term spending cuts with Democrats.\n\nFollowing a White House news conference on Monday, during which the president labeled Republican threats to hold firm on the nation's borrowing as \"irresponsible,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, expressed his view that the upcoming debt limit debate offers an opportune moment to compel Democrats to address the deficit.\n\n\"The president and his allies need to get serious about spending, and the debt-limit debate is the perfect time for it,\" Mr. McConnell said. \"I do know that the most important issue confronting the future of our country is our deficit and debt. So we are hoping for a new seriousness on the part of the president with regard to the single biggest issue confronting the country, and we look forward to working with him to do something about this huge, huge problem.\"\n\nPresident Obama countered that Republican threats to default on the nation's debts are \"absurd,\" warning that such a move would send stock markets plummeting and jeopardize any hope of a significant economic recovery this year.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican, swiftly rebutted, characterizing the president's remarks as more of the same from Mr. Obama.\n\n\"The American people deserve better from Washington. We cannot deliver meaningful change and necessary reforms if we refuse to address out-of-control spending,\" he said. \"Under President Obama, we have seen record-setting deficit spending and trillions added to our nation's debt. This is a leadership failure.\"\n\nMr. Cantor also criticized the White House for its failure to meet the deadline for delivering its budget for the upcoming fiscal year to Congress. The White House informed the House Budget Committee late last week that it would not comply with a Feb. 4 deadline to send its budget to Congress, as required by law.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and vice presidential nominee last year, who oversees the panel, commented, \"The Senate hasn't passed a budget in nearly four years, and that is inexcusable.\"\n\nThe Tea Party Patriots, the nation's largest tea party group, asserted that Mr. Obama has spent four years driving up the deficit and stalling when it comes to spending cuts, forcing Republicans to take drastic measures such as threatening to hold the line on raising the debt limit or shutting down the government to prompt Democrats to negotiate on spending.\n\n\"It is the president who is holding our economy hostage to his vision of spending more now regardless of the consequences,\" said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots. \"It is the president whose deadbeat policies handicap our economy and stunt growth. It is the president and his party who pass deadline after deadline without passing a budget so that the American people can review and analyze it.\"\n\nMr. Obama maintains that his November re-election victory is evidence that the public supports his plan for higher taxes on the wealthy and a \"balanced\" approach to deficit reduction.\n\n\"While I am willing to compromise and find common ground on reducing the deficit, America can not afford another debate over whether it should pay the bill [Congress] already racked up,\" he told reporters.\n\nOver the weekend, he also rejected suggestions by some congressional Democrats that he bypass Congress in the debate and unilaterally act to ensure the federal government's debts are paid.\n\nThe Treasury, which has been managing federal finances since the nation hit the debt limit of $16.4 trillion last month, has informed the president and Congress that it will exhaust short-term fixes within weeks.\n\nSome Republicans, disgruntled with the \"fiscal cliff\" deal that Mr. McConnell negotiated with Vice President Joseph R. Biden this month, are beginning to embrace the idea of shutting down the government to force Mr. Obama's hand when it comes to cutting spending.\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican who heads the GOP conference, told Politico that she believes House Republicans could very well shut down the government to extract spending cuts from Democrats. The shutdown would be imposed if Congress does not pass another spending bill to fund the government's general operations by March 27.\n\n\"We always talk about whether or not we're going to kick the can down the road,\" she said. \"I think the mood is that we've come to the end of the road.\"\n\nThe White House, citing the impact of the last standoff over the borrowing limit, has stated repeatedly that there will be no negotiations with Republicans over raising the debt ceiling. After months of brinkmanship over the debt limit, the credit ratings firm Standard & Poor's downgraded U.S. debt for the first time in 70 years in 2011.\n\nThe government hit the debt ceiling on Dec. 31, but the Treasury started taking emergency measures to allow it to continue issuing debt and prevent any type of default for just a short window of time.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center states that the Treasury will exhaust its options for meeting the government's bills between Feb. 15 and March 1.",
    " Title: Former Ohio State Wrestlers Accuse Rep. Jim Jordan of Ignoring Sexual Abuse Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the weekend, a seventh former wrestler at Ohio State University came forward, accusing Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) of being aware but doing nothing in response to the largest sexual abuse scandal in U.S. sports history. For weeks, Jordan has maintained that he was unaware of the systematic abuse by team trainer Richard Strauss while serving as an assistant coach for the Buckeyes wrestling team in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThree former wrestlers told NBC News that Jordan had knowledge of the allegations and did not take action to stop the abuse. Since then, four more former teammates have corroborated these accounts, stating that it was impossible for Jordan to be unaware of the abuse. The seventh wrestler came forward on Friday in an interview with the Washington Post.\n\nDavid Range, who wrestled for Ohio State in the late 1980s, stated, \"Jordan definitely knew that these things were happening \u2014 yes, most definitely. It was there. He knew about it because it was an everyday occurrence.\"\n\nNo one has accused Jordan of engaging in any abusive behavior himself, but several of his former athletes, including some who considered Jordan a friend, have expressed resentment over the congressman's denial of knowledge about the abuse.\n\nIn a Politico report last week, other former Ohio State personnel described the wrestling team as a \"cesspool of deviancy\" during the period in which Jordan served as an assistant coach. Even Jordan's supporters have acknowledged that the toxic culture was widespread and well-known.\n\nJordan himself acknowledged as much during an interview on Fox News Friday evening, seemingly contradicting his earlier pleas of ignorance when he told host Brett Baier, \"Conversations in a locker room are a lot different than allegations of abuse.\"\n\nPart of the hangup appears to be over semantics. In the 1980s, exactly what constituted sexual abuse\u2014as opposed to merely \"inappropriate\" or \"creepy\" behavior\u2014was even less understood than it is today. Jordan has insisted no wrestler ever came to him with a story of \"sexual abuse.\" However, Dunyasha Yetts\u2014one of the first wrestlers to come forward, who says he asked Jordan to accompany him to Strauss's office because he feared he would be groped\u2014says it's a difference without a distinction.\n\n\"Yeah, you can say we never told you those words because we didn't know those words, which is true,\" Yetts told Politico. \"But for him to say he didn't know? I asked him to come in there with me!\"\n\nNot only has Jordan remained unapologetic for his role in Ohio State's still-unfolding scandal, he has threatened at least one victim of sexual assault with the capitol police.\n\nThe accusations have threatened to upend Jordan's once-promising political career. His fellow far-right extremists in Congress were urging Jordan to seek a leadership position in the Republican caucus once retiring Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) relinquishes his title as Speaker of the House, and Jordan himself has said he wishes to succeed Ryan as Speaker, a position held by other Republican luminaries including former wrestling coach Dennis Hastert.",
    " Title: Greta Thunberg's Address at the United Nations Climate Action Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nGreta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, delivered a passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on September 23, 2019. The speech, which was met with applause and criticism, saw Thunberg criticizing world leaders for their inaction on climate change.\n\nThunberg, a 16-year-old from Sweden, accused the leaders of stealing her dreams and childhood with their empty words. She stated, \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\" Thunberg's journey to the summit was noteworthy, as she sailed across the Atlantic last month to avoid jet travel.\n\nThunberg is the face of a global youth movement against climate change, which includes a global \"climate strike\" last week. The movement is being promoted and celebrated by adults who find it useful for their own purposes.\n\nThe article suggests that young people, including Thunberg, are being used as pawns by adults with their own agendas. The author argues that children have little to offer in terms of nuanced and mature perspectives on complex issues. The article also criticizes the adults who feed children apocalyptic warnings, which the children then repeat as urgent insights.\n\nThe article also highlights the achievements made in various areas such as poverty reduction, life expectancy, and primary school completion rates, suggesting that today's youth will have more resources and technology to address climate change than any other generation in history.\n\nThe article also mentions that some young activists have dropped out due to depression, anxiety, and fears that world leaders will not act in time to prevent irreversible environmental harm. The author attributes this to the adults who enable and feed the children apocalyptic warnings.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the children will grow up, even in a warming world, and that the ultimate responsibility lies with the adults who enable and feed the children apocalyptic warnings.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant climate change agreement, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have pledged to curb their greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades. Under the agreement, the United States will reduce its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28% before 2025, while China will peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and aim to obtain 20% of its energy from zero-carbon emission sources by the same year.\n\nPresident Obama, who was in Beijing for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, stated, \"We have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change.\" The announcement marks the first time China has agreed to peak its carbon emissions, according to the White House.\n\nXi is calling for an \"energy revolution\" that would include broad economic reforms addressing air pollution. Obama expressed hope that the deal will encourage other nations to tackle climate change. Xi and Obama are committed to working toward the goals before the U.N. Climate Conference in Paris next year.\n\nThe Center for Climate and Energy Solutions described the joint announcement as \"an extremely hopeful sign.\" The agreement could put climate change back on the G20 agenda, according to researcher David Holmes of Monash University in Australia. However, some critics argue that the goals laid out by Obama and Xi were not as ambitious as hoped.\n\nThe White House stated that the ultimate target is to \"achieve deep economy-wide reductions on the order of 80% by 2050.\" The Obama administration hopes to sell the plan back home by touting the anticipated savings on energy costs and initiatives and incentives to develop more solar and wind power in both countries.\n\nHowever, the Senate's top Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell, stated that the climate change deal will hurt the U.S. economy. China has agreed to provide another 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar, and other zero-emission generation capacity by 2030, exceeding all the coal-fired power plants that exist in China today and close to total current electricity generation capacity in the United States.",
    " Title: Illegal Immigrants from Central America Abandoned in U.S. States After Border Apprehension\n\nArticle:\n\nScores of illegal immigrants, primarily from Central American countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala, have been apprehended by authorities in Texas while attempting to enter the United States via the Rio Grande Valley. Instead of being returned to their country of origin, these individuals are being flown, bused, and then abandoned in various states, including Arizona, New York, and Maryland.\n\nIf the immigrants were from Mexico, they would typically be released back across the border. However, the process of returning Central American immigrants to their home countries has been costly and largely unsuccessful.\n\nLawmakers in Arizona, which has been grappling with the issue of illegal immigration for years, have criticized the practice. Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Smith stated, \"What an astonishing failure of leadership at every level inside the Beltway.\"\n\nIra Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told Reuters, \"essentially, they have gotten successfully into the country and it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019re going to leave.\"\n\nThe number of apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley has increased significantly in recent years, with south Texas now serving as the main gateway for illegal immigration along the southwest border with Mexico. Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector apprehended 154,453 immigrants last year, up from 97,762 the previous year.\n\nA particularly concerning aspect of the situation is the unprecedented surge of children making the over 1,000-mile journey from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border to escape violence in their home countries. Reports of horrific incidents, including rape and murder of young children, have emerged from border districts.\n\nFloridalma Bineda Portillo and her two young boys were part of a group of about 400 Central Americans who were flown from Texas to Tucson last weekend. Bineda Portillo and others were then transported to Phoenix after the Tucson Greyhound station ran out of space.\n\nUpon arrival at the station in Phoenix, a volunteer nurse found Bineda Portillo's five-year-old son, Hugo David, wheezing and struggling to breathe. His asthma inhaler had been lost during the family's processing by immigration. Bineda Portillo's three-year-old son developed a cold after sitting on the floor for hours in the detention center, according to his mother.\n\n\"We all started crying because we didn't know what was going to happen to us. It was brutal,\" the Guatemala native said in Spanish.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., told Reuters, \"This is a humanitarian crisis and it requires a humanitarian response.\"\n\nMost of the families apprehended so far in Texas have been flown to Arizona and dropped off by the busload at the station in Phoenix by federal immigration authorities overwhelmed by a surge of families caught crossing the Mexican border into the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated that it does not wish to detain minors in detention centers or separate families. Instead, they are expected to return to Texas on their own once their deportation process nears completion, in an honor system of sorts.\n\n\"After screening by DHS authorities, the family units will be released under supervision and required to report in to a local ICE office near their destination address within 15 days, where their cases will be managed in accordance with current ICE enforcement priorities,\" according to an ICE statement.\n\nBineda Portillo fled Guatemala due to growing violence and domestic abuse. Her mother, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, sent her money for the bus ride there. In the meantime, volunteers from the Phoenix Restoration Project, a humanitarian group, have been at the Greyhound station since Tuesday, handing out food, clothing, diapers, and other supplies.\n\n\"It's always heart-wrenching, especially when we're working with women, because they're less likely to be able to read and sometimes are coming from very rural areas of Central America, and Spanish isn't their first language,\" volunteer Cyndi Whitmore said. \"We see a lot of women who are very scared, very vulnerable.\"",

Wallace, who served as White House communications director in the George W. Bush administration and as a GOP campaign aide, noted that Trump shared an edited video clip on Thursday that made it appear as if Pelosi was stuttering.\n\nThe video, while not doctored itself, was shared on the same day The Washington Post reported that doctored videos portraying Pelosi as if she were drunk had gone viral on social media. Wallace pointed out that the slowed-down video \"has the effect of making anyone look like they\u2019re having a hard time speaking.\"\n\nTo illustrate the impact of doctored videos, Wallace aired a clip of herself speaking that had been slowed down, allowing her audience to see what she looked and sounded like when doctored. She also played a clip of a campaign speech that had been altered, a video that Trump himself has been a victim of.\n\nWallace's MSNBC show decided not to show the clip of Pelosi that Trump shared with his 60.5 million Twitter followers. President Trump, on Friday, denied knowledge of the altered videos and praised his ability to work with the Democratic leader before accusing her of \"not helping the country.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know about the videos. I can tell you that \u2014 what I\u2019m here is to help the country,\" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving on a trip to Japan.",
    " Title: Clinton and Trump Adopt Different Strategies as Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days following their televised debates, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump have adopted starkly different tactics to reach the more than 200 million Americans who have registered to vote in the upcoming election. While Trump has focused on raucous swing state rallies that some have compared to a rock music tour, Clinton is investing heavily in TV advertising and local organizing, with an eye toward states that were once safely Republican.\n\nClinton's strategy could potentially secure her more than the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House and may also help Democrats win back control of Congress. Speaking at a rally in Orlando, Florida on Sunday night, Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine suggested Clinton was headed toward a \"very big and historic win\" on November 8. However, Clinton campaign aides have not discounted the risk that Trump could benefit from an unpredictable 2016 electorate, especially in swing states like Ohio where polling remains tight.\n\nTrump advisers acknowledge they are facing an uphill battle, but maintain the country's anti-establishment mood will work in their favor in the final few days. Trump's son, Eric Trump, echoed these sentiments but rejected the idea that his father was playing to his base of support.\n\nSome Republicans are sceptical Trump can find a way to win. Karl Rove, who masterminded George W Bush's narrow election victories over Al Gore and John Kerry, was sceptical on Sunday that there was enough time left. The Clinton campaign remains confident that it can spare resources on punishing the Republican party for standing with Trump, who has repeatedly broken the norms of American politics and energized once shunned leaders, such as former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke.\n\nClinton's campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said the campaign wanted to \"extend an open hand\" to traditionally Republican voters even as it targets the \"different strain\" within the party that continues to support Trump, despite his offensive remarks about women, immigrants, and minorities. Although many Senate veterans, including John McCain and Kelly Ayotte, have rescinded their endorsements of Trump, he has retained his vociferous base and the muted support of House speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nClinton's campaign will continue to court \"reasonable Republicans and independents\" who might be willing to defect across party lines. Trump Jr also told ABC that his father would \"100%\" accept the results of the election if it was fair.",
    " Title: Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine Shows Promise in Early-Stage Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nA candidate vaccine for COVID-19 developed by Moderna and the federal government appears to be safe and triggers an immune response, according to data from an early-phase trial released on Tuesday. However, it remains unclear whether this immune response is sufficient to protect individuals from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, according to several experts who reviewed the results.\n\nModerna's chief medical officer, Tal Zaks, stated that while the protective effect of the vaccine cannot technically be known yet, all indications are that mRNA-1273 will be safe and effective. The levels of protective antibodies produced by trial participants were similar to those found in patients who had recovered from COVID-19, suggesting that the candidate vaccine provides the same protection as an infection.\n\nAnimal studies show mRNA-1273 can protect mice against infection, and trials in primates and Syrian hamsters are underway. The mRNA-1273 candidate did not generate a kind of immune cell that in other diseases made vaccinated people worse off, Zaks said.\n\nThe clinical trial was led by Anthony Fauci's Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. The experimental vaccine was created quickly, with a volunteer in Seattle being injected on March 16, just two months after Chinese scientists revealed the virus's genetic sequence.\n\nIn the trial, 45 participants were divided into three groups: one that received a high dose, one a medium dose, and one a low dose. Each person received two shots, a month apart. All the reactions in the two lower dose groups were mild, with more than half experiencing minor fatigue, chills, headache, or muscle pain, as is typical with vaccines. Three of those who received the highest dose had a severe reaction after the second shot, according to the study, including one participant whose fever spiked to 103 degrees.\n\nThe highest dose, 250 micrograms, was dropped from later-stage trials, and only the 100-microgram dose will be proposed for use in people. All the participants showed evidence of an immune response, which is the goal of immunization. However, it's not clear how much of an immune response will be needed to protect against infection.\n\n\"It looks like their vaccine was able to induce a virus neutralizing antibody, which is positive,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \"But it's hard to know if the level of virus neutralizing antibody will be sufficient to induce protective immunity, or if it compares favorably with other (vaccine) candidates.\"\n\n\"These are good results,\" said Dr. Nadine Rouphael, who helped lead the trial at Emory University School of Medicine. She agreed with Hotez that it's too early to know whether the vaccine will be protective. Neutralizing antibodies are key for fighting other infections, she said, but there are a lot of questions about COVID-19.\n\n\"How long will they stay, what's the right level of protection remains to be determined,\" she said Tuesday. Learning whether the vaccine is protective will require a much larger study. A so-called Phase 3 trial with 30,000 participants is slated to begin on July 27, Zak confirmed.\n\nOne challenge, Rouphael said, will be to find trial participants who naturally catch COVID-19. In trials for a Zika vaccine, the disease was brought under control, and it was very difficult to determine whether the vaccine was protective, because no one was catching it, she said.\n\nThousands of people volunteered for the small Phase 1 trial, Rouphael said, and she hopes people will continue to sign up for the research. The novel coronavirus works by invading human cells, then forcing them to reproduce the virus in high volumes. One way to stop the disease could be to get the body to produce antibodies in advance that would prevent the virus from penetrating cells. Though the results show people injected produce antibodies, it's not known whether that protects them from getting sick.\n\nModerna relies on a technology the company compared to digitizing vaccines. Rather than injecting someone with a weakened or dead virus, Moderna uses genetic material to trick the body into producing the critical antibodies before a person gets infected. Moderna was founded in 2011, but it has not successfully produced a vaccine.\n\nThe company, which went public in 2018, will join the NASDAQ-100, which includes the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nPaul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said it is not easy to understand what's going on in the immune system after vaccinations. Offit helped develop a vaccine against rotavirus, testing it in 35,000 infants and getting blood samples from all of them. The vaccine worked in most babies, he said, but even with so many blood samples, researchers never figured out what was different about the immune systems of the babies who did not get protection.\n\n\"You'd think we'd be able to say here's why they were not protected,\" he said, but \"we could not find an immune correlate.\" The goal is to have a vaccine ready in limited batches by January, or at the latest next summer. There is no way to tell whether either of those timetables are feasible. Historically, vaccines take many years to develop.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at \u2588\u2588\u2588 is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

    " Title: Obama Administration Pushes for Gun Legislation Outside Washington, Faces Challenges in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is taking its push for gun legislation beyond the confines of Washington, D.C., in an apparent acknowledgment of the obstacles any gun control bills may face in Congress. On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden held a round-table discussion in Richmond, Virginia, speaking with individuals who worked on gun safety following the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting.\n\nBiden, who became the administration's point person on guns following the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, last week released recommendations that include renewing the assault weapons ban, limiting the size of ammunition magazines, and implementing universal background checks. However, in Richmond, Biden stated that the effort does not stop there. \"We're going to continue to go around the country and try to get the best minds to give us further insight into what the president is trying to do,\" he said.\n\nBiden was joined in Richmond by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who was governor of Virginia at the time of the Virginia Tech shooting. \"There are things you can do that work,\" Kaine said. \"We do not have to despair about being able to reduce gun violence. There are things you can do that work to reduce gun violence. You can do them by working together.\"\n\nHe pointed to an improved background records check put into place in Virginia after the shooting. Biden stated that in light of the Sandy Hook shooting, now is the time to act. \"What happened up in Newtown\u2014beautiful little babies, 6 and 7 years old, riddled, riddled with bullet holes. Twenty of them dead. I've met with most of their parents. It is a national tragedy,\" he said.\n\nBiden is not the only one making impassioned pleas. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, introduced a new assault weapons ban on Thursday. However, she was clear-eyed about its chances. \"This is really an uphill road,\" she said. \"If anyone asks today: Can you win this? The answer is we do not know. It's so uphill.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association promptly released a statement saying the senator \"has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades.\" \"The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein's wrong-headed approach,\" it said.\n\nCharles Ramsey, Philadelphia's police commissioner, spoke at Feinstein's press conference, stating that this is what always happens after a mass shooting. \"And then it's business as usual as lobbyists begin to kind of quietly go about trying to influence the outcome of any legislation that's passed,\" he said. He wondered aloud if maybe this time would be different. \"If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up because I do not know what else will. We have to pass legislation. We cannot allow the legislation to get so watered down and filled with loopholes that it is meaningless and won't do anything.\"\n\nFeinstein stated that if her bill and others were to have any chance at all, the push would have to come from outside of Washington. \"If America rises up,\" she said. \"If people care enough to call every member of the House and every member of the Senate and say, 'We have had enough,'\" she said.\n\nThe Obama administration's political team is also asking for such support, as evidenced by emails blasted out to supporters on Friday and a website set up for reporting how the conversations go. A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday may provide an early sense of the mood in Congress. Set to appear are Wayne LaPierre of the NRA and Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in another mass shooting.",
    " Title: Fusion GPS Attorney's Testimony Sparks Speculation Over Death of Ex-KGB Agent\n\nArticle:\n\nA cryptic statement made by the attorney for Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson during a Senate investigation has sparked speculation about the death of a former KGB agent, Oleg Erovinkin, who was found dead in his car in Moscow in December 2016. In a 300-page testimony transcript released Tuesday, Joshua Levy stated, \"Somebody\u2019s already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.\"\n\nThe transcript, taken on Aug. 22 but released by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has led to a guessing game about the identity of the deceased individual. The most plausible guess, at least for now, seems to be Erovinkin, a top aide to Igor Sechin, a former deputy prime minister who was named repeatedly throughout the dossier.\n\nAccording to a January 2017 report in British newspaper The Telegraph, Erovinkin was suspected of helping former MI6 spy Christopher Steele compile information on Donald Trump for the dossier. British journalist Luke Harding, in his book \"Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump win,\" alleges that the street where Erovinkin's body and the car were found was desolate, making it an ideal spot for an assassination.\n\nLocal media reports at the time of his death suggested foul play, but it was later claimed that his death was a result of a heart attack. In the aftermath of his death, media reports speculated that Erovinkin was an unnamed informant for the dossier. Christo Grozev of Risk Management Lab, a think-tank based in Bulgaria, claimed in a January 2017 Haaretz article that Erovinkin was the main source of information for the dossier.\n\nLevy did not immediately return messages requesting information about who he was referring to in his statement.",
    " Title: North Korea Threatens Counteraction Against U.S. Over Joint Military Exercises with South Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has threatened to counter the United States if the U.S. proceeds with joint military exercises with South Korea, as stated by North Korea's official KCNA news agency on Saturday. The U.S. is due to start these exercises in early April, according to a South Korean presidential security adviser, as reported by Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe joint military exercises, which North Korea has previously described as a threat, are part of a series of drills that have been a regular point of contention between the two nations. North Korea's KCNA news agency warned that if the U.S. holds these exercises while maintaining sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), North Korea will respond with its own mode of counteraction, and the U.S. will bear the responsibility for the ensuing consequences.\n\nOn February 23, the U.S. announced its largest package of sanctions aimed at pressuring North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. President Donald Trump warned of a \"phase two\" that could be \"very, very unfortunate for the world\" if the steps did not work. North Korea has criticized the unilateral sanctions imposed by the U.S., but it has expressed a willingness to engage in talks with the U.S. during senior North Korean officials' visit to South Korea for the Olympics last month.\n\nThe White House has stated that any talks with North Korea must lead to an end of its nuclear program. North Korea reiterated on Saturday that it is open to talks with the U.S., but it will not accept any preconditions. A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman, as quoted by state media KCNA, said, \"We will neither beg for dialogue nor evade the military option claimed by the U.S.\"\n\nIn response to an invitation from leader Kim Jong Un, South Korea plans to send a special envoy to North Korea, as announced by South Korean President Moon Jae-in in a phone call with President Trump on Thursday. The Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang last month provided a boost to recent engagement between the two Koreas after a significant increase in tensions over North Korea's missile program.",
    " Title: Mississippi Senate Runoff: Cindy Hyde-Smith Wins, Becomes First Woman Elected U.S. Senator in Mississippi\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Cindy Hyde-Smith emerged victorious in the Mississippi Senate runoff on Tuesday, defeating Democrat Mike Espy in the deeply conservative state. With 97 percent of the vote counted, Ms. Hyde-Smith led Mr. Espy by almost 8 percentage points, receiving 53.9 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent.\n\nIn a jubilant speech in Jackson, Ms. Hyde-Smith thanked God, her family, and President Trump, who made rally stops in Tupelo and Biloxi on Monday. She also reached out to the entire state, stating, \"I want everybody to know, no matter who you voted for today, I\u2019m going to always represent every Mississippian. I will work very hard, do my very best to make Mississippi proud of its U.S. senator\u2014the people of Mississippi deserve that.\"\n\nMr. Espy addressed a dejected crowd also in Jackson before 10 p.m., earlier than many people expected the runoff to be decided. He congratulated Ms. Hyde-Smith and expressed his prayers for her as she goes to Washington to represent Mississippi.\n\nThe runoff, being the night's sole race and coming after Democratic victories nationwide on Nov. 6, garnered considerable attention. Ms. Hyde-Smith's victory makes her the first woman to be elected U.S. senator in Mississippi, though an Espy win would have also made history, as he would have become the first black person elected to such office since the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction.\n\nHowever, partisan control of the Senate did not turn on the result; Republicans would have a majority either way, and Ms. Hyde-Smith's win cemented the margin at 53-47. When polls closed at 8 p.m. EST, Mississippi officials estimated that between 30 percent and 40 percent of registered voters had cast ballots.\n\nMr. Espy trailed Ms. Hyde-Smith by just a point on Election Day, but since she failed to break the 50 percent barrier, the election functioned as a sort of jungle primary and led to Tuesday's runoff. Ms. Hyde-Smith's own words and opposition research groups' efforts produced an unwelcome picture of a racially insensitive Mississippian who joked about suppressing the liberal college vote. Democrats tried to magnify that image by blaming Ms. Hyde-Smith for her parents' decision to send her to a segregated academy in Mississippi as a schoolgirl.\n\nTo counter that, Ms. Hyde-Smith repeatedly brought up Mr. Espy's checkered past, which included indictments stemming from his work as agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration. Although Mr. Espy was acquitted at trial of all charges, the Hyde-Smith campaign also unearthed information about Mr. Espy's lucrative lobbying work on behalf of a former Ivory Coast dictator now on trial at the International Criminal Court facing charges of crimes against humanity.\n\nThus, the ebb and flow of the runoff weeks left each candidate with a clear objective. Ms. Hyde-Smith needed to persuade enough Mississippians not to stay home in yet another post-Thanksgiving election, while Mr. Espy worked to show he remained true to his state and was not a creature of the Washington \"swamp.\"\n\nDemocrats hoped Ms. Hyde-Smith's awkward comments, including one about \"a public hanging\" in a state with a dark history of lynchings, would create a scenario similar to last year's special Senate election in adjoining Alabama. But there, Republican Roy Moore faced much graver claims involving underage girls, and he was never a favorite of the Republican establishment.\n\nThose weren't handicaps for Ms. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to the Senate by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant when Sen. Thad Cochran resigned this year for health reasons. Given Ms. Hyde-Smith's support, along with the firm backing of President Trump who made two campaign appearances Monday on her behalf, Mr. Espy had a much steeper climb than Democrat Doug Jones had to capitalize on Mr. Moore's past in Alabama.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith did not apologize for her \"public hanging\" comment until the runoff's only debate on Nov. 20. Nevertheless, the incidents never knocked her off message. She insisted repeatedly that she would \"represent Mississippi's conservative values\" and offered a stark contrast between herself and Mr. Espy on immigration, taxes, business regulation, judicial philosophy, and the Second Amendment.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith's open embrace of Mr. Trump and his agenda also appeared designed to appeal to the nearly 17 percent of Mississippi voters who chose Chris McDaniel, a right-wing former state senator, on Election Day. After his loss, Mr. McDaniel offered a lukewarm endorsement of Ms. Hyde-Smith, saying she was the only candidate left who could help Mr. Trump in Washington.\n\nMr. Espy allowed surrogates to launch most of the attacks against Ms. Hyde-Smith while he positioned himself as a Blue Dog Democrat with a lifelong affection for Mississippi. He insisted he would not be a mindless rubber stamp for the self-styled \"resistance\" to the Trump administration and held himself out as a gun owner who would not give knee-jerk support to any gun control measure.\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged he would have voted against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in his contentious confirmation process last month. That provided ripe fruit for Mr. Trump, who in his Mississippi rallies repeatedly highlighted how Ms. Hyde-Smith was the candidate with the judicial philosophy most in tune with Mississippi's majority.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith and Mr. Trump also scoffed at Mr. Espy's claim of independence, saying he would vote in lockstep with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\n\nMr. Espy said he would confront the administration when necessary but try to work with it in most cases, but appearances on the campaign trail for him from Sens. Kamala D. Harris of California and Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, two senators associated with the resurgent left wing, appeared to tie him closely to the Democratic Party's best-known figures in Congress.",
    " Title: Senate Considers Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, Exposing Abortion Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is preparing to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that aims to ensure medical care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion. The legislation was reintroduced in January 2019 by Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) following comments made by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam suggesting that in some circumstances, newborns who survive near-abortion procedures might not receive necessary care.\n\nLast February, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the born-alive bill, which requires newborns to receive the same level of care as any other infant born at the same gestational age. Critics of the bill argue that \"born-alive\" infants do not exist, but this claim is disputed, as there is both anecdotal and reported evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures with some regularity.\n\nDemocrats counter that existing laws already prevent infanticide, but this is not the case. There is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. As of last count, only 33 states have such laws in place, while New York's legislature repealed the state's born-alive protections in 2019.\n\nCritics of the bill have also labeled it as \"anti-abortion,\" but the bill does not regulate when or whether healthcare or abortion may be made available to women. It merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion the same way they would treat any other newborn infant.\n\nThe bill's opponents argue that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. The bill's proponents argue that it exposes the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion.\n\nThe success of the bill in the Senate remains uncertain, but the debate surrounding it is likely to shed light on the ethical and moral implications of abortion. The bill's passage or failure may reveal the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them rights the instant after birth.",
    " Title: Al-Qaeda Affiliate Murders American Journalist and South African Teacher During US Special Forces Rescue Operation\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), murdered American journalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie during a US special forces rescue operation on Friday night. The terrorists mortally wounded the hostages to prevent them from being rescued; US special forces appear to have been just moments away at the time. Somers died while being evacuated to a nearby US Navy ship; Korkie died in the ship's hospital.\n\nThe hostages were taken captive by AQAP. Korkie and his wife Yolande Korkie were kidnapped in May 2013, while American freelance journalist Luke Somers was kidnapped from the capital city of Sanaa in September 2013. Yolande Korkie was released in January, but AQAP held on to Somers. In November, US special forces launched a rescue operation in Yemen that retrieved eight hostages from AQAP.\n\nOn Wednesday, AQAP announced that it would kill Somers and Korkie if the US did not pay the demanded ransom. On Friday, President Obama approved a US-led special forces operation, along with Yemeni soldiers, to rescue the two hostages, held in a village in southern Yemen. About 100 soldiers descended on the village very late on Friday night. US special forces landed six miles away from the village and hiked in to preserve the element of surprise.\n\nDuring the firefight, US special forces observed a single AQAP militant enter the building where the hostages were held. The militant was only there \"for about a five to seven count...long enough of course to shoot people or take any other action,\" according to a Pentagon official. The militant had attempted to murder the hostages: by the time special forces got to the building, the hostages had both suffered from very serious unspecified injuries.\n\nBoth hostages were loaded onto a helicopter and flown to a nearby US Navy ship. Somers died en-route; Korkie died on the ship hospital operating table. Most countries pay ransoms when their citizens are taken hostage abroad. The US refuses to do this, believing that paying ransoms would just give terrorists the incentive to kidnap more Americans; instead, it uses the US military to rescue its citizens, which makes taking Americans hostages more dangerous. The US policy is controversial and much-debated but is ultimately meant to protect American lives.\n\nOver the past year or two, terrorist groups in the Middle East have been taking more Americans hostage. Terrorist groups in Syria, including the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have taken several Americans hostage and demanded exorbitant ransoms for their release. During 2014, ISIS has begun murdering its American hostages, beginning with the journalist James Foley, and broadcasting horrific videos of their deaths. While there are surely multiple overlapping reasons that ISIS would do this, one reason that some analysts have suggested is that ISIS may be attempting to compel the US to change its policy on paying ransoms.\n\nPublic outrage in the US over the terrorist murders of American citizens has been significant. While the Obama administration has stepped up efforts to rescue American hostages, AQAP's pledge to murder Somers if it did not receive its ransom\u2014a pledge it ultimately kept\u2014shows that jihadist terrorist groups are committed to forcing the US to start paying ransoms, even at the cost of inviting US special forces raids.\n\nThe recent increase in terrorist groups taking and murdering American hostages can be partially understood as a conflict between jihadists and the United States over America's ransom-paying policy. It is not clear who will prevail\u2014the US government insists it will not bend, but public pressure could change that\u2014but, in the meantime, American journalists and aid workers abroad will continue to be targeted as pawns in the conflict.",
    " Title: Papadopoulos' Conversation with Australian Diplomat Sparks Counterintelligence Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nA conversation between a Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos, and an Australian diplomat in May 2016 was a catalyst for the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, according to a new report from The New York Times. During the encounter at an upscale London bar, Papadopoulos reportedly told Alexander Downer, Australia's top diplomat to the U.K., that the Russian government had dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nPapadopoulos, a 30-year-old energy consultant, claimed in a later encounter that a London-based associate named Joseph Mifsud had informed him in April 2016 that Russian government officials had obtained Clinton emails. It is unclear whether Papadopoulos shared this information with anyone within the Trump campaign.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his encounters with Mifsud and at least two Russian nationals. As part of his plea deal, Papadopoulos agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nThe FBI became aware of Papadopoulos' claims more than two months after the London meeting with Downer. The Australian government decided to share the information with U.S. investigators after emails stolen from Democrats began to be released by WikiLeaks.\n\nAccording to the Times, current and former law enforcement officials stated that the Papadopoulos lead\u2014and not the infamous Steele dossier\u2014was what sparked the counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin operatives.\n\nFormer British spy Christopher Steele met with the FBI in July 2016 to share some of his findings from an investigation he was conducting of Trump on behalf of Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was working for the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have questioned how heavily the FBI relied on the dossier for the Russia probe and for a secret surveillance warrant obtained in Sept. 2016 against Carter Page, another Trump campaign adviser. Page is accused in the dossier of being the Trump campaign's liaison to the Kremlin. He denies the allegation.\n\nThe Times reported earlier this year that the FBI's investigation was also sparked by a trip that Page made to Moscow in July 2016, while he was still with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Times also provided new details about Papadopoulos' interactions with an alleged source for the dossier. According to the newspaper, Papadopoulos met several times during the summer leading up to the election with Sergei Millian, the chairman of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce. Millian has been identified as a source for some of the more salacious allegations about blackmail material on Trump and about collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin. Millian, who was born in Belarus, has denied being a source for the dossier.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr to Release Redacted Mueller Report Within a Week\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr has pledged to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report within a week. Testifying before a congressional panel on Capitol Hill, Barr defended his handling of the report amidst criticism from Democrats who accused him of cherry-picking information to favor President Donald Trump.\n\nBarr, in his first appearance since revealing the central findings of Mueller's Russia investigation, stated that his office is working diligently to prepare the report for release. He maintained that the special counsel is cooperating with his team, and his initial timetable of releasing the report by mid-April remains intact.\n\nFour areas of the report that Barr believes should be redacted include grand jury material, information that would reveal intelligence sources and methods, any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions, and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of \"peripheral players.\" The Justice Department, with the help of the special counsel's office, plans to \"color code the decisions from the report and provide explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction.\"\n\nDemocrats have criticized Barr for his handling of the report, particularly his four-page summary released last month that outlined the findings of the 300-plus page report. House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey accused Barr of \"cherry-picking\" information to draw the most favorable conclusion possible for the president. Other Democrats made similar comments during the hearing, which was originally meant to address Barr's fiscal 2020 spending request for the Justice Department.\n\nLawmakers focused on Barr's four-page summary, where he stated that there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. The special counsel also reviewed whether the president had obstructed justice in any way, but ultimately did not come to a conclusion on that issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, though, said the evidence was \"not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"\n\nIn her fiery opening statement, Lowey accused Barr's handling of the report as \"unacceptable.\" She argued that it was \"suspicious\" to make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours after evaluating hundreds of pages of evidence, legal documents, and findings. After repeated exchanges about the report, Barr eventually appeared to bristle at questions from Democrats about the report's process and contents.\n\nUnder subsequent questioning from Lowey, Barr said he would not discuss the report any further and made clear that he has no plans at the moment to initially release the unredacted version to committees. Meanwhile, in a statement last week, the DOJ defended Barr's rollout of Mueller's conclusions, stating that the Attorney General decided to release the report's bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately, with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process. The statement also noted that every page of Mueller's report was marked that it may contain grand jury material \"and therefore could not immediately be released.\"",
    " Title: U.N. Report Warns of Resurgence of Al Qaeda in Middle East, Led by Usama bin Laden's Son\n\nArticle:\n\nA United Nations (U.N.) report has warned that the next significant terror threat in the Middle East could originate from Al Qaeda, led by the son of Usama bin Laden. The report, delivered to the Security Council and released this week, provides insights into both terror networks.\n\nThe report indicates that while the Islamic State (ISIS) has been militarily defeated in Iraq and most of Syria, it has rallied in early 2018 and still maintains approximately 20,000-30,000 members in the two countries. The U.S.-led coalition in the region has achieved numerous military victories against the group, reducing its territory to mere pockets in Syria. President Trump declared victory in his State of the Union address this year, stating, \"I\u2019m proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria.\"\n\nHowever, the report suggests that ISIS is transitioning from a proto-State network to a covert network, continuing to pose a threat to other countries, with its leadership still intact under Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe report also raises concerns about the resurgence of Al Qaeda, which had been overshadowed by international attention on ISIS and its brutal tactics. The report states that Al Qaeda is a global network demonstrating resilience, and it is stronger than ISIS in places like Somalia, Yemen, and South Asia. Furthermore, Al Qaeda's leadership in Iran has grown more prominent, and Usama bin Laden's son, Hamza bin Laden, has \"continued to emerge as a leadership figure in Al Qaeda.\"\n\nThe report states, \"Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership demonstrates strategic patience and its regional affiliates exercise good tactical judgment, embedding themselves in local issues and becoming players.\" Earlier this month, The Guardian reported that Hamza, who has expressed a desire to avenge his father, is believed to have married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the Egyptian national who hijacked and flew the first plane into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nWhile the U.N. report states there is little evidence as yet of a direct global threat from Al Qaeda, it warns that improved leadership and enhanced communication will likely increase the threat over time, as will any rise in the tendency, already visible in some regions, of ISIS supporters to join Al Qaeda.\n\nThe report comes amid growing international concern about the civil war in Yemen between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-backed Houthis. Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP) has gained a foothold in the south of the war-torn country amid the chaos in the region.\n\nThis month, an Associated Press investigation found that the Saudi-led coalition has been cutting secret deals with Al Qaeda fighters, paying some to leave cities and towns, allowing others to retreat with weapons and cash. Others were recruited to join the coalition. Participants in those agreements stated that the U.S. was aware of the arrangements and held off on drone strikes.\n\nU.N. Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths has invited both sides of the conflict to meet in Geneva for talks in September.",
    " Title: \"21 Democratic Presidential Candidates Gather at South Carolina Fish Fry, Aiming to Win Over Black Voters\"\n\nArticle:\n\nTwenty-one of the 24 major Democratic presidential candidates attended a fish fry in Columbia, South Carolina, on Friday, marking the largest gathering of candidates yet and offering an opportunity to engage with black voters, a crucial voting bloc in the early primary state next year. The event, hosted by U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black lawmaker in Congress, serves as an unofficial kickoff to the Democratic primary race in South Carolina.\n\nThe fish fry, which attracted an estimated 4,400 pounds of fried fish and 6,400 slices of bread, took place in the state that holds the fourth nominating contest early next year. South Carolina's Democratic electorate is estimated to be about 60 percent black.\n\nAntjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist who advised Hillary Clinton's 2016 and 2008 presidential campaigns, stated, \"It is the first place, and a real test case, for where people see where their support is with African American voters.\"\n\nSouth Carolina is a state that swings strongly Republican, with its governor and two U.S. senators being Republican. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential election was in 1976, and Republican President Donald Trump triumphed in South Carolina in 2016 with 54.9% of the vote.\n\nTwo contenders, U.S. Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, have invested heavily in South Carolina and view it as critical to their path to the nomination. However, the candidates, who are both black and frequently discuss race during their campaigns, have not seen a corresponding bump in polls.\n\nBy the end of this weekend, Harris and Booker will have attended 31 and 27 events in the state, respectively, according to a tally by the Post and Courier newspaper in Charleston, South Carolina. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has attended only four campaign events in South Carolina ahead of this weekend, netted a 20 percentage point-lead in a Post and Courier-Change Research Poll of 933 likely primary voters taken June 11-14.\n\nThe poll showed overall support for Biden softening to 37% from 46% two weeks after his campaign launch in late April. However, the former vice president maintained a dominant lead among black voters at 52%.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, both picked up support overall, coming in second and third place with 17% and 11%, respectively. Harris and Booker each ticked up 1% from the month prior, coming in at 9% and 5%.\n\nSeawright cautioned that at this point in the race, polls nationwide and in South Carolina mainly reflect familiarity with the candidates. Biden enjoys widespread name recognition due to serving eight years as vice president for Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president.\n\nAt a recent happy hour for progressive voters in suburban Charleston, the eight loyal Democrats in attendance said they welcomed the attention the large and diverse Democratic field was lavishing on South Carolina. All agreed they would enthusiastically support the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 2020 general election against President Donald Trump, the presumed Republican nominee, even if they were not their first choice in the primary.\n\nLaurie Steinke, 61, said she first \"met and fell in love with Kamala Harris,\" then considered Buttigieg. She drove across the state to see Booker before \"Elizabeth Warren came to town and blew me away.\"\n\nMany South Carolina primary voters live in rural areas without high-speed broadband internet, requiring outreach in the state to be done on the ground. \"You can't just do the new wave of campaigning where you run digital ads and get on TV,\" Seawright said. \"You have to have a real grassroots activated program, knocking on doors, visiting synagogues and places of worship, showing up at community events, going to the fish fries, going to family reunions.\"\n\nHarris on Wednesday stepped up her outreach to historically black colleges and universities by adding a section to her campaign website dedicated to organizing student groups, particularly fraternities and sororities. South Carolina has eight historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and Harris attended another, Howard University, in Washington.\n\n\"Kamala Harris intends to win South Carolina, which is why we're the first to have paid organizers and prominent endorsers in every region of the state,\" South Carolina director Jalisa Washington-Price told the media.\n\nMontana Governor Steve Bullock, former Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska, and Buttigieg were the only declared candidates who were not present at the fish fry, which Clyburn began hosting three decades ago. Clyburn has not yet endorsed any of the Democratic contenders.\n\nMany of the Democratic candidates attending the fish fry echoed the sentiment that once the primary is over, the party should unite behind its nominee. \"When the primary is over we become a united force,\" Booker said.",
    " Title: Puerto Rico Governor Requests Audit of Whitefish Energy Contract Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPuerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has requested an audit of the contract awarded to Whitefish Energy, a small Montana-based company, to restore power on the island. The request, made in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general's office on Wednesday, has sparked a Twitter feud and later an apology by Whitefish.\n\nThe lack of experience of Whitefish, coupled with its location in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown, has fueled questions about how it secured the $300 million contract. In a tweet, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a frequent opponent of President Donald Trump, accused the company of \"admitting political motivations.\"\n\nWhitefish responded to Cruz's tweet, stating, \"We\u2019ve got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived. Do you want us to send them back or keep working?\" Cruz responded, \"They are threatening not to do their job which frankly is quite irregular for a company hired to work for the public sector.\"\n\nCruz called the contract \"alarming\" in an interview with Yahoo News and suggested it should be \"voided.\" Whitefish later apologized for its comments, stating, \"Mayor Cruz and everyone in Puerto Rico -\u2013 on behalf of our employees, we would like to apologize for our comments earlier today, which did not represent who we are and how important this work is to help Puerto Rico's recovery.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have also called for an investigation into the contract. Many lawmakers questioned why the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority had chosen to work with Whitefish instead of reaching out to the American Public Power Association, which normally matches states hit by disasters with nearby public power utilities who have offered up crews and equipment.\n\nFounded in 2015, Whitefish says it has mobilized a team of nearly 300 subcontractors in Puerto Rico to help restore the island's electrical infrastructure in the wake of Hurricane Maria. The company claims it called Puerto Rico before Maria hit to pitch its own services.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., stated, \"We want to see restoration pick up. Every day that they're without power is a day that the economy isn't functioning and it's another day people are suffering.\"\n\nGovernor Rossello stated that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also had questions about how the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority had awarded the contract to Whitefish Energy, which had just two full-time employees when the contract was signed. However, FEMA had no comment on the contract at this time because \"it appeared to comply 100 percent with FEMA regulations.\"\n\nOnly 25 percent of the island has power 35 days after Maria hit the island, according to the governor's office.",
    " Title: Trump Administration to Expand Mexico City Policy, Allocating $8.8 Billion for Global Health Assistance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is set to significantly expand the Mexico City Policy, a pro-life initiative that prohibits non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from performing or promoting abortion as a family planning method in foreign countries. The expansion will be announced on Monday as a new policy titled \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.\"\n\nUnder the new policy, $8.8 billion in global health assistance funds will be appropriated through various federal agencies and departments, including the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is highlighted due to its inclusion in the policy, as it was not previously covered under the Mexico City Policy.\n\nPreviously, the policy only applied to family-planning assistance provided by USAID and the State Department, amounting to approximately $600 million. The new policy extends the requirements to a much wider pool of money within federal agency programs, including international health programs for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, and family planning and reproductive health.\n\nThe policy will not apply to all funding. Excluded will be humanitarian assistance such as migration and refugee-assistance activities, USAID disaster and humanitarian-relief activities, and U.S. Department of Defense disaster and humanitarian relief.\n\nNGOs that refuse to comply with the pro-life guidelines will forfeit the funding, with the funds being redirected to organizations that do adhere to the policy. The White House official stated, \"Foreign NGOs that agree not to perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, or provide financial support to any other foreign non-governmental organization that conducts such activities, will remain eligible for global health assistance funding.\"\n\nA Marist Poll in January showed 83 percent of Americans oppose federal funding of overseas abortions, including nearly 40 percent of people who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. This policy is expected to be a winning issue for the Trump administration.",
    " Title: Chronological Account of Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against President Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nAt least 25 women have made sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump since the 1970s. The following is a chronological account of these allegations:\n\n1. In the 1970s, several women accused Trump of sexual misconduct, but the specific details and identities of these women are not publicly known.\n\n2. In 1992, Trump's first wife, Ivana Trump, claimed in her divorce deposition that he had raped her in 1989, an allegation Trump has denied.\n\n3. In 2000, writer E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the mid-1990s.\n\n4. In October 2016, the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape revealed Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without consent. This led to a surge of women coming forward with their own stories.\n\n5. In the months following the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, several women made their allegations public, including former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, who alleged Trump groped her in 2007.\n\n6. In 2017, several women who had previously made allegations against Trump, such as Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, came forward again to rehash their stories.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied the allegations, dismissing them as \"fabricated\" and politically motivated. He has not yet made good on his promise to sue any of the women, although two women have sued him. The White House has stated that Trump's election proves the American people do not consider the allegations disqualifying.\n\nA December 2017 Quinnipiac poll found that 50% of voters, including 59% of women and 41% of men, think the president should resign as a result of the sexual misconduct allegations against him. Several Democratic lawmakers have previously called on Trump to resign over the allegations.\n\nOne accuser, Samantha Holvey, who spoke out in 2016 about her experience with Trump as a Miss USA pageant contestant, said in 2017 that while Trump's election was painful, she and others see the #MeToo movement as an opportunity to \"try round two.\"\n\nHere are all of the allegations, in chronological order, made by 25 named women:\n\n1. Ivana Trump, first wife of President Trump (1970s-1989)\n2. E. Jean Carroll (mid-1990s)\n3. Unnamed women (1990s)\n4. Summer Zervos (2007)\n5. Rachel Crooks (2005)\n6. Jessica Leeds (1970s-1980s)\n7.

    " Title: Supreme Court Hearing on Proposition 8: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Proposition 8, a California ballot proposition that bans same-sex marriage. The hearing will feature three lawyers, each with a limited time to present their case.\n\nA. Charles J. Cooper, representing the proponents of Proposition 8, will have half an hour to address questions about his clients' standing and the reasons offered to support the ban on same-sex marriage. David Boies, representing the couples challenging the ban, will have 20 minutes. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, representing the Obama administration, will have 10 minutes.\n\nIn cases where a federal law is challenged for violating equal protection principles, courts typically ask if the law can be justified by a rational reason. This is a low bar, but several courts have struck down laws discriminating against gay men and lesbians under this standard. Gay rights advocates are hoping that the Supreme Court will adopt a more stringent standard of review, known as \"heightened scrutiny,\" which requires a showing that the challenged law is \"substantially related to an important government objective.\"\n\nThe proponents of Proposition 8 argue that preserving the traditional definition of marriage will \"further society's vital interests in responsible procreation and child rearing.\" They contend that redefining marriage as a genderless institution would undermine these interests. They also argue that changing the definition of marriage should proceed with caution, respecting societal judgments made through the democratic process.\n\nOn the other hand, they acknowledge that allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry would not make it more likely that straight couples would act irresponsibly. They also argue that courts must protect the fundamental rights of disfavored minorities.\n\nJustice Kennedy, who is considered to hold the decisive vote and is the author of the two leading gay rights cases, is known for his cryptic nature. Chief Justice Roberts may be intrigued by the standing question, and his questions on this issue may suggest whether he might find dismissal on that ground an attractive offramp.\n\nThe court's decision could range from requiring all states to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry, to stating that the Constitution is silent on the question, leaving states free to allow or reject same-sex marriage. The court could also adopt a rationale that would apply only to California, or suggest the \"eight-state solution\" proposed by the Obama administration. Alternatively, the court could dismiss the case for lack of standing, which would effectively allow same-sex marriages in California.",
    " Title: Dispute Arises Over Attribution of Malware Used in Target Data Breach\n\nArticle:\n\nA dispute has arisen over the attribution of the malware used in the massive data breach at Target, the second-largest retailer in the United States. The California-based cybersecurity firm IntelCrawler claimed on Friday that a 17-year-old Russian teenager authored the malicious software, but this assertion has been disputed by Brian Krebs, a widely followed Internet security blogger who initially broke the Target story.\n\nIntelCrawler, based in Los Angeles, stated that the teenager, who is \"close\" to 17 years old, authored the malicious software, known as BlackPOS, and reportedly sold it for approximately $2,000 to dozens of cybercriminals in Eastern Europe and other countries. However, Brian Krebs disputed this information in an interview and on Twitter.\n\nIn response to the dispute, Dan Clements, president of IntelCrawler, stated on Sunday, \"We don't think we are wrong.\" While IntelCrawler alleges that the teen authored the malware, it does not allege that he perpetrated the breach. Clements explained that IntelCrawler's CEO did a report on BlackPOS earlier last year, and the teen was identified then as the author and is allegedly a well-known programmer of malicious code in the underground world.\n\nTarget has not commented on the data breach, which affected up to 110 million customers, since Sunday. The same malware may have been involved in a similar but smaller attack on luxury retailer Neiman Marcus around the same time, according to IntelCrawler. The retailer has not disclosed the number of customers affected by its breach.\n\nThe retailers had no further comment on the incidents on Sunday, and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries. The software reportedly enabled the thieves to remotely hack into Target's computer systems and obtain customer credit card numbers and other information, which was then sent back to a computer controlled by cyber thieves. State and federal officials, including the Secret Service, have launched an extensive investigation into the breaches.",
    " Title: Federal Regulator Approves Palcohol, Powdered Alcohol for Sale\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has granted approval for the sale of Palcohol, a powdered alcohol product. The product, initially approved last year, was later revoked due to labeling errors. On Wednesday, TTB spokesman Tom Hogue confirmed that four varieties of Palcohol have been approved. However, states have the authority to regulate alcohol sales within their borders.\n\nThe approval marks a significant step for the small company, whose product has already sparked controversy. Several states, including Colorado, have moved to ban powdered alcohol. In Colorado, lawmakers advanced legislation last month to temporarily halt its sale, which has since evolved to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it receives federal approval.\n\nConcerns about Palcohol include potential abuse by minors, the possibility of snorting the powder, and the product's light weight making it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks. Palcohol comes in a pouch, with water added to the powder inside for an alcoholic drink equivalent.\n\nAccording to a statement on Palcohol's website, the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer. Palcohol founder Mark Phillips confirmed the approval of his products in an email early Wednesday morning, but did not provide pricing details. Phillips also stated that another Palcohol product, Lemon Drop, should be approved shortly.\n\nPhillips initially developed Palcohol as a means to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to carry heavy bottles. TTB spokesman Tom Hogue explained that the bureau regularly consults with the Food and Drug Administration to determine if a product might be considered \"adulterated.\" If the FDA deems the product safe, the TTB's evaluation focuses on whether labels accurately reflect the product's contents.\n\n\"Potential for abuse is not grounds for us to deny a label,\" Hogue said. The four approved Palcohol products include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan, a margarita, vodka, and rum. Phillips expects the Lemon Drop product to be approved shortly.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Years-Long Challenge of Reaching Beyond White, Male Base and Updating Voter Turnout Machine\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the 2012 election, the Republican Party is grappling with the consequences of a defeat that exposed significant weaknesses in their political infrastructure and demographic appeal. The consensus among party leaders is that the GOP faces a multi-year challenge of reaching out to Americans beyond their predominantly white, male base and modernizing a voter turnout machine that is outdated.\n\nThe path forward is not clear-cut, with Republicans acknowledging the difficulty of finding a charismatic leader to spearhead the party's recovery. Florida Senator Marco Rubio's name was frequently mentioned as a potential candidate.\n\nThe GOP's current state is one of a fractured institution, with power divided among traditional organizations like the Republican National Committee, the two chambers of Congress, and numerous outside groups. To address the structural problems that led to the party's downfall on Tuesday, a revitalized national party is needed, according to GOP leaders.\n\nOhio Senator Rob Portman described the election result as a \"wake-up call.\" West Virginia Representative Shelley Moore Capito, who is considering a Senate bid in 2014, stated that the party needs to acknowledge it is \"not diversified like the country\" and risks losing women voters and minorities in future elections.\n\nCapito emphasized that the concern among women voters is not solely about abortion, but rather a broader issue of the Republican Party intervening in personal choices. She cited her 27-year-old daughter, stating that young women do not accept any limitations on their choices.\n\nVirginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, Mitt Romney's state chairman in the Old Dominion and a candidate for governor in 2013, acknowledged that Republican voter identification and mobilization efforts did not produce the expected results. He stated that the party needs to improve outreach to women, Latinos, and young voters to have a chance of winning national elections in the future.\n\nThe initial sense of shock on election night, as the possibility of President Barack Obama's reelection became clear, deepened into a more depressive mood on Wednesday as the extent of the party's defeat became apparent.",
    " Title: Justice Department Seeks New Method to Include Citizenship Question in 2020 Census\n\nArticle:\n\nThe printing process for the 2020 census forms has commenced, but the U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly seeking a new method to include a controversial question regarding citizenship status. The initial 2020 census form does not contain this question, as the Supreme Court previously denied the Trump administration's request to include it.\n\nHowever, following a tweet from President Trump suggesting that reports of the Commerce Department abandoning the citizenship question are untrue, the Department of Justice has been instructed to continue searching for a way to include the question on the 2020 census forms.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to block the citizenship question was based on the majority's finding that the administration's justification for the question, which was to better enforce the Voting Rights Act and protect the voting rights of racial minorities, was \"contrived.\" The Court determined that the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, has the authority to add the question, but a legitimate reason was not provided.\n\nThe Justice Department has stated in a letter to a federal judge in New York that they are currently looking for another way to justify the inclusion of the citizenship question on the 2020 census forms. If the Trump administration announces a new justification, it remains to be seen whether the courts will deem it a reasonable and legal method to include the question.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland has set a deadline of Friday, 2 p.m. Eastern, for the Justice Department to inform the court of its plans. If the Trump administration intends to make another case for the citizenship question, the judge in Maryland is prepared to reopen and reconsider already-filed allegations against the question, including claims that the decision to add the question was intended to discriminate against immigrant communities of color and that there was a conspiracy among Trump administration officials.\n\nThe 2020 census is scheduled to officially begin in January, and the count of every person living in the country is crucial for the process to be completed on time. The printing and finalization of the questions on the form are essential components of the preparations for the census.",
    " Title: Rep. Maxine Waters Warns Threatened Opponents to \"Shoot Straight\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally in Los Angeles on Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) warned those who might intend to harm her, stating, \"Shoot straight because there's nothing like a wounded animal.\" The comments were made in response to death threats that led her to cancel speaking events in Alabama and Texas this weekend.\n\nThe threats followed Waters' calls for opponents of President Donald Trump's immigration policies to confront and harass members of his Cabinet in public settings. Last weekend, she said, \"Already you have members of your Cabinet who have been booed out of restaurants.\"\n\nWaters' remarks appear to be a reference to incidents involving members of Trump's Cabinet. Last week, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted by protesters at an upscale Mexican restaurant in Washington, D.C. Additionally, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia on Friday due to her association with Trump.\n\nOn Monday, Trump responded to Waters' calls for activists to confront White House officials, tweeting, \"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\n\nThis is not the first time Waters has made such a statement. At a town hall meeting in Inglewood last year, while criticizing Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Waters heard a pop. She told the crowd, \"I don\u2019t know what the sound was, but whoever it is, if it\u2019s a shot, you better shoot straight!\"\n\nThe specifics of the threats against Waters and the incidents involving Trump's Cabinet members are not available at this time.",
    " Title: Superdelegate Controversy Affects Sanders and Trump Campaigns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding superdelegates in the 2016 Democratic and Republican primary elections is causing tension among supporters of the candidates.\n\nOn the Democratic side, supporters of Bernie Sanders argue that their votes are being nullified by superdelegates. Jordan Float, a 25-year-old nursing assistant at a Philadelphia hospital and a volunteer with the Sanders campaign, stated, \"Our presidents, our congressmen, anyone in Washington, should not be decided by anyone but the public.\"\n\nBernie Sanders himself has criticized the \"rigged political system,\" but has been less critical of the influence of superdelegates. He recognizes the need to win over these delegates to secure the nomination. Some supporters of Sanders have toned down their attacks on superdelegates, with the \"Superdelegate Hit List\" no longer using the word \"Hit\" and replacing arrows with telephone cords.\n\nOn the Republican side, the situation is more acute due to Donald Trump's position as the front-runner in the delegate race. Trump's chances of not being the nominee before the convention are increasing, as he may fall short of the 50 percent-plus-one delegate threshold set by the Republican National Committee.\n\nTrump and his supporters have been vocal in their criticism of the process, expressing fears that his delegates will be \"stolen\" at the convention. One of Trump's longtime associates, Roger Stone, has been urging demonstrations at the national convention in Cleveland in July. Stone has also threatened to post the hotel room numbers of delegates who switch their votes against Trump.\n\nThis article does not include any personal opinions, political bias, or subjective statements. It is intended to provide a neutral and factual account of the superdelegate controversy in the 2016 primary elections.",
    " Title: Twitter's Role in Political Discourse: A Decade of Unforeseen Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn June 2009, Twitter executives Biz Stone and Jason Goldman found themselves in an unfamiliar territory, drafting a blog post about a subject far beyond their comprehension: Iranian politics. The social media platform, initially known for its use in connecting with friends at social events, had evolved into a political tool during the protests in Tehran against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nAs the protests escalated, Twitter became a means for Iranians to communicate and rally for change under the hashtag #ChangeforIran. Aware of this development, Stone and Goldman were approached by a State Department official, who requested Twitter to delay a scheduled maintenance during the critical protests. After a series of phone calls and emails, Twitter agreed to postpone the maintenance.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and Twitter continues to grapple with the political implications of its platform. The company finds itself in the uncomfortable role of arbiter in numerous debates, skirmishes, and conflicts, a position that was highlighted when President Trump appeared to taunt North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Twitter regarding the endowment of his nuclear button.\n\nTwitter's centrality as a communications platform for such exchanges is concerning, given that the platform discourages nuance, patience, and privacy. As the saying goes, millions of people wake up each morning, log in to their Twitter accounts, and ask themselves, \"Who are we going to be mad at today?\"\n\nIn early 2019, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey stated that the company would not ban world leaders, including President Trump, from Twitter, regardless of the rules they break. The company's reasoning was that such a move would hide important information and hinder necessary discussion.\n\nTwitter's position is complex, balancing its role as a public company with its mission to promote free speech. This complexity, combined with leadership changes, may explain the company's inconsistent approach to managing volatile conversations. The latest blog post contradicted earlier company statements, and the flip-flopping has left users and the media perplexed as to how Twitter makes these decisions, particularly when it comes to one person\u2014Donald Trump\u2014and not the other 299,999,999 users.",
    " Title: Trump Delivers Post-Midterm Assessment, Criticizes Fellow Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered a post-mortem of the Republican electoral losses in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, criticizing fellow party member Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) who has not yet officially conceded her election. Love trails Democratic challenger Ben McAdams by about 5,000 votes with 30 percent of precincts still outstanding.\n\nTrump's remarks shared his predecessors' candor but lacked their humility. He rattled off a list of candidates who won after he campaigned on their behalf, then mocked some of his fellow Republicans who \"did not want the embrace\" from him so close to the election.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad,\" Trump said of the losses suffered by Republican candidates who distanced themselves from his unpopular presidency. \"I think I feel just fine about it.\"\n\nThe Republican Party's performance in Tuesday's midterm elections has been widely acknowledged as increasingly \"Trumpian\" by commentators and analysts. The specifics of their arguments differ, but the central thesis is the same. The Republican Party is now \"decidedly more Trumpian,\" writes Ben Domenech of The Federalist, \"having seen the elimination of its most moderate and Trump-critical members, and the support of those who embraced Trump emphatically on the campaign trail and in policy preferences.\"\n\nThe effect may be more pronounced in the Senate, where several GOP senators who were at times thorns in Trump's side are now gone. This includes the late John McCain (R-Ariz.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), both of whom are retiring. Marsha Blackburn, who was elected Tuesday to replace Corker, made Trump's endorsement a centerpiece of her campaign, a fitting analogy for the transformation of the GOP on the national stage.\n\nTrump's broad assessment of the GOP's performance on Tuesday has more than merely a ring of truth to it. The specifics of who comprises the Senate Republican conference and the number of seats they control will be determined in the coming days, but the central thesis is the same: The Republican Party is increasingly the party of Trump.",
    " Title: The Suspension of Habeas Corpus During Emergencies: A Historical Perspective on Lincoln and the Civil War\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on the self-image of the United States as a free nation, with its rule of law being a cornerstone. However, the tension between liberty and law becomes apparent during times of crisis, as seen in the suspension of certain rights to ensure societal order.\n\nDuring the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus, the right against arbitrary imprisonment, in response to secessionist terrorism and the raging Civil War. This action was met with resistance from Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, who issued a writ of habeas corpus in favor of John Merryman, a Maryland militiaman detained by Union forces.\n\nLincoln's decision to disregard the court's writ was justified, as the survival of the United States was at stake. The Constitution explicitly provides for the restriction of some rights during emergency conditions, as the Framers recognized the need for a government capable of quelling threats.\n\nThe Constitution's habeas provision (Article I, Section 9) specifies when the right may be suspended (when required for public safety in cases of rebellion or invasion), but not by whom (the president or Congress) it may be suspended. In the 1860s, Congress was not easily called into session, and the Constitution's habeas provision does not explicitly state that only Congress can suspend the right. Furthermore, Congress endorsed Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus in 1863.\n\nWhen restrictions are implemented during emergency conditions, it is crucial to remember that fundamental rights are being limited. Restrictions should be no more extensive than the threat reasonably demands. History has shown that, while some restrictions may be necessary, they can also lead to abuses, as seen in the internment of American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II.\n\nIn conclusion, the suspension of habeas corpus during emergencies is a complex issue with historical precedent. It is essential to strike a balance between security and liberty, ensuring that restrictions are necessary and proportionate to the threat at hand. The United States has learned from its past mistakes and continues to evolve in its approach to emergency situations.",
    " Title: President Obama's Oval Office Address: Analysis and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, President Barack Obama delivered an Oval Office address on Sunday night. The speech, however, was met with criticism for its lack of concrete policy proposals and perceived attempts to shift blame.\n\nInstead of addressing the root causes of the attack, such as the ideology of radical Islam, the president could have used the opportunity to explain why a low-tech, soft-target terrorism incident occurred and outline his plans to address the issue. Critics argue that he could have acknowledged errors in granting a U.S. visa to a jihadist from Pakistan and reconsidering the admission of Syrian refugees.\n\nThe president's call for Congress to ban individuals on the no-fly list from purchasing firearms was seen as an attempt to shift blame for security lapses within his administration. Critics argue that gun control measures, even if implemented, would not have prevented the San Bernardino attack, as demonstrated by recent attacks in Paris and the ineffectiveness of gun control in Chicago.\n\nThe president's moralizing about avoiding \"suspicion and hate\" was criticized as an implied accusation of American bigotry, another attempt to shift blame. This criticism follows a statement by Attorney General Loretta Lynch that the government would prosecute anti-Muslim speech that \"edges toward violence,\" a vague and potentially controversial statement.\n\nThe president's reassurances about the fight against ISIS were met with skepticism, as the group has continued to expand its influence despite a year and a half of U.S.-led war. Calls for Congress to approve retroactive anti-ISIS measures were seen as an attempt to shift blame for the flagging effort down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to Congress.\n\nCritics also pointed out the president's refusal to acknowledge the success of the 2007 surge in Iraq, which proved that American-led ground forces could be effective, and the potential for a U.S.-led coalition to turn administration of Syria over to local tribes after destroying ISIS.\n\nThe speech's overall tone and content were criticized for lacking a clear strategy for defeating ISIS, fighting the ideological war against radical Islam, and defending rather than blaming the American people. Critics argue that a new president with a clear strategy and the ability to restore alliances could address these issues more effectively.",
    " Title: OPM to Allow Federal Contribution to Congressional Healthcare Premiums\n\nArticle:\n\nLawmakers and their staff can expect their health care costs to remain manageable next year, as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is set to issue a ruling allowing the government to continue contributing to their health care premiums. The ruling is expected as early as Friday, according to several Hill sources.\n\nThe issue stemmed from a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that required members of Congress and their aides to be covered by health plans \"created\" by the law or \"offered through an exchange.\" The OPM had not previously clarified whether the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) could contribute to premium payments for plans on the exchange. If the OPM had not issued this ruling, lawmakers and aides would have faced significant increases in their premium payments each year, as the government currently contributes nearly 75 percent of premium payments under the FEHBP.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's involvement in resolving this impasse was unusual, but it came after concerns were raised from both sides of the aisle about potential \"brain drain\" due to the potential for spiking health premiums. The fear was that aides would leave for more lucrative jobs, spooked by the potential for increased health care costs.\n\nThere was a sense of urgency, as enrollment in the exchanges was set to begin on October 1. Discussions of a legislative fix, such as attaching language to a must-pass bill to resolve the problem, were considered, but proved too difficult in today's paralyzed Washington.\n\nWhite House officials acknowledged that a fix was needed, but they knew that once they dealt with it through a regulation, some Republicans would use it against them, even though most of their party was privately concerned about the issue.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement Thursday night, touting the law's benefits and Democrats' efforts to educate consumers. \"Members of Congress and their staffs must enroll in health marketplaces as the Affordable Care Act requires,\" she wrote. \"As we continue our work to ensure the smooth implementation of this law and look forward to the start of enrollment on October 1st, we will continue our efforts this August to educate consumers on the law's provisions and tout the critical benefits already in place for millions of Americans.\"\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) expressed anger over the issue, tweeting a link to a news story Thursday night with the comment: \"Outrageous exemption for Congress.\"",
    " Title: Jobless Claims Reach 41-Year Low, but Experts Warn of Potential Economic Bubble\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Labor reported a drop in seasonally-adjusted initial unemployment claims to a 41-year low in the week ended July 18. However, this data might not be as positive as it appears, according to Lee Adler, editor of The Wall Street Examiner newsletter.\n\nAdler argues that the jobless claim data are stronger than they seem due to the use of seasonally-adjusted fictitious data. He states that the actual, non-seasonally-adjusted number has been at a record low relative to total employment since September 2013.\n\nDespite this, Adler acknowledges that the seasonally adjusted number is \"remarkable,\" especially given that the workforce was much smaller 41 years ago. However, he expresses concern that the current numbers are well beyond the bubble record lows of 1999-2000 and 2006-07, implying that this economic situation may be unique and potentially unsustainable.\n\nRecalling the stock market crashes in 2000-01 and 2008-09, Adler suggests that employers in some sectors may be hoarding workers, a behavior associated with economic bubbles, which has historically led to massive retrenchment within 18 months or so.\n\nOn the equities front, while U.S. stocks stand at historically high valuations, valuations in foreign markets are much lower, making them attractive, according to MarketWatch columnist John Coumarianos. The S&P 500 index carried a trailing price-earnings ratio of 21.24 on July 17, up from 19.54 a year earlier. Robert Shiller's cyclically-adjusted price earnings ratio (CAPE) for the S&P 500, which includes 10 years of earnings, stands at 26.9. For months, it has hovered at its highest levels excluding the pre-market crash periods of 1929, 2000, and 2007.\n\nCoumarianos suggests that if the current level of U.S. stock prices is concerning, investors might find attractive investment bargains in other countries' markets. He provides data from Research Affiliates showing 24 markets that trade cheaper than the United States, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, and India.\n\nCoumarianos expresses particular enthusiasm for British stocks, stating that the U.K.'s current CAPE of 12.4 is low compared to other countries and regions, and below its own median of 14.6 using data going back to 1969. He also suggests that investors should not worry too much about currency exposure to the pound.",
    " Title: Tom Perez's Aggressive Speeches Spark Controversy in Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nTom Perez, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has been using a controversial and aggressive approach in his speeches, criticizing the Republican Party and attempting to rally partisan support. As the face of the Democratic Party, Perez, who is associated with the 18th-century founders Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, is now the party's new brand.\n\nIn a recent speech, Perez accused the Republicans of not caring about voters, and the Democratic Party's official store is selling a T-shirt for $30 that reads, \"Democrats give a sh*t about People.\" This approach has sparked controversy and discomfort among some, with many finding it difficult to describe this shift towards such a raw and explicit tone.\n\nThe use of anger and scatology in Perez's speeches has been compared to the rhetoric of 20th-century dictators, with Perez's gestures and tone evoking images of emotional flagellation. Some have questioned whether this is the best approach for the Democratic Party, which is seeking to connect with voters outside of the coastal regions and restore its reputation.\n\nThe shift in tone and strategy has been attributed to the shock and denial felt by the Democratic Party following the election of Donald Trump. Some analysts suggest that the party is trying to find a new marketing strategy to appeal to a broader audience, while others see it as a reflection of the increasingly polarized political climate in the United States.\n\nThe use of such aggressive and explicit language in political discourse has sparked debate among political scientists, with some attributing it to the influence of the media, social media, and the internet, which create channels for the most vile human behaviors to become electromagnetic waves. Others point to the conduct of former presidents such as Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, suggesting that anything goes in the Oval Office, and anything goes anywhere.\n\nSome have also pointed to the influence of philosophical movements such as existentialism, which emphasizes subjective human judgment and the idea that truth is whatever the individual perceives it to be. This philosophy can justify all sorts of repugnant behaviors and can be used to glorify them, as seen in the \"whatever\" culture and the \"Me\" culture, which justify the pursuit of self-satisfaction and create vast phalanxes of eupeptic vulgarians.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Perez's aggressive approach, it has sparked controversy and debate, with some seeing it as a necessary response to the Republican Party's tactics and others viewing it as a further descent into the depths of political discourse. The impact of Perez's speeches on the Democratic Party and the political landscape as a whole remains to be seen.",
    " Title: National School Walkout Planned by Women's March Youth EMPOWER in Response to Congressional Inaction on Gun Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nThe organizers of the Women's March have announced a national school walkout next month, aimed at protesting Congress's lack of action on gun reform following recent mass shootings. The event, titled Women's March Youth EMPOWER, invites students, teachers, and parents to participate in a 17-minute walkout on March 14 at 10 a.m. One of the sites where a walkout is planned is Parkland, Florida, the location of the country's latest mass school shooting.\n\nAccording to the group's website, the objective of the walkout is to demand Congress pass legislation to ensure school safety from gun violence. The website states, \"We need action. Students and allies are organizing the national school walkout to demand Congress pass legislation to keep us safe from gun violence at our schools, on our streets and in our homes and places of worship.\"\n\nThe website further emphasizes the right of students and staff to learn and teach in a safe environment, and the right of parents to send their children to school and expect them to return home safely. The statement reads, \"We are not safe at school. We are not safe in our cities and towns. Congress must take meaningful action to keep us safe and pass federal gun reform legislation that addresses the public health crisis of gun violence.\"\n\nThe organizers' website lists over two dozen walkouts planned across the country, with information for other localities wishing to participate. The walkout event follows the deadly mass shooting on Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, which left 17 dead. The 19-year-old suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, reportedly claimed \"demon\" voices told him to carry out the violence, according to law enforcement sources.",
    " Title: Eastern Ukraine Referendum Results Raise Doubts Over Legitimacy Amidst Allegations of Voter Fraud\n\nArticle:\n\nSeparatists in eastern Ukraine have declared victory in Sunday's referendums, claiming that voters overwhelmingly favored independence from Kiev. However, the poll tallies and multiple anomalies observed by journalists have raised major doubts about the legitimacy of an exercise that Kiev swiftly denounced.\n\nAccording to results released by the self-proclaimed electoral commissions of the regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, 96.2 percent and 89.07 percent of voters favored self-rule, respectively. Separatists in both regions claimed a 75 percent turnout.\n\nThe results are impossible to independently confirm, as no election monitors were allowed to observe voting. Many Western news outlets reported instances of voter fraud and ballot stuffing, as well as voters' general lack of understanding of what they were opting for. CNN filmed several voters casting ballots repeatedly, or even multiple ballots at one time. BBC reporters found multiple irregularities in the city of Mariupol:\n\n* Only a handful of polling stations served Mariupol, a city of half a million.\n* Anyone could vote in any polling station in the region simply by scribbling their name on a piece of paper, they say.\n* One pro-Ukraine teacher said she received death threats after refusing to let rebels use her school as a polling station.\n* The BBC also notes that \"This was a vote that was organized, run, and then counted by the activists behind it.\"\n\nThese incidents do not disprove the purported results, but they add credence to interim President Oleksandr Turchynov's condemnation of the results. \"The farce, which terrorists call the referendum, will have no legal consequences except the criminal responsibility for its organizers,\" Mr. Turchynov said today, reports the Associated Press.\n\nThe European Union also criticized the vote, calling it illegal. The EU is expected to enact further sanctions against Russia today for its annexation in March of Crimea, Reuters reports.\n\nRussia took a different tone. The Kremlin's press service said that \"Moscow respects the expression of will of the population of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions and proceeds on the basis that the implementation of the results of the referendums will be carried out in a civilized way,\" reports independent news service ITAR-TASS.\n\nRecent independent polling in eastern Ukraine sharply conflicts with the referendum results. A poll released last week by Pew Research found that 70 percent of respondents in the east \u2013 and 58 percent of Russian-speaking eastern respondents \u2013 wanted Ukraine to remain whole. Only 18 percent of easterners, and 27 percent of eastern Russian-speakers, said the eastern regions should be allowed to secede.\n\nThe Pew findings appear to roughly match an April poll on attitudes in southeastern Ukraine conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS). Both found high dissatisfaction with Kiev's governance, but little appetite for outright independence.\n\nSunday's referendums only took place in the two easternmost regions of Ukraine. The two earlier polls considered attitudes in a much larger portion of eastern Ukraine \u2013 11 regions by Pew, eight by KIIS. However, for the referendum results to square with the earlier polls, support for secession would have to be minuscule outside of the Lugansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nThe BBC notes that even among those who did vote on Sunday, there appeared to be confusion over just what they were voting for. The BBC's Sarah Rainford in Donetsk wrote that \"Some thought they were casting their ballot to join Russia, some people believed they were voting just to have more power in eastern Ukraine. Even the leaders of the referendum have different comments when you ask them what this is about.\"",
    " Title: Guards at Metropolitan Correctional Center Suspected of Falsifying Log Entries Regarding Jeffrey Epstein\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigations into the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City on Saturday, have led to suspicions that guards at the facility may have falsified log entries regarding their checks on Epstein and other inmates.\n\nAccording to a report by the Associated Press on Tuesday, surveillance video reviewed after Epstein's death shows that guards at the MCC did not make some of the checks they claimed to have made, as per their log entries. The New York Times reported, citing unnamed officials, that the guards fell asleep at some point and did not check on Epstein for up to three hours.\n\nThe federal jail workers had claimed they were checking on inmates in Epstein's unit every half hour, but investigators now believe that was not the case. The Justice Department on Tuesday said that two guards assigned to watch Epstein had been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe latest revelation, first reported by CBS News, comes amid growing conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death as he awaited trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Prosecutors said he sexually abused dozens of young girls in his New York and Florida residences between 2002 and 2005, allegations that could have landed him behind bars for 45 years.\n\nAttorney General William Barr said Monday there were \"serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning,\" and said he was demanding \"a thorough investigation.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Epstein's apparent suicide, his alleged \"recruiter\" Ghislaine Maxwell now finds herself under scrutiny. Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, has vowed to continue the investigation into Epstein, who, at the time of his death, was in a New York facility awaiting trial on allegations he operated an underage sex trafficking ring.\n\nSeveral of Epstein's accusers have pointed to Maxwell as playing a pivotal role in enlisting his victims, according to thousands of pages of court documents unsealed on Friday in relation to a 2015 defamation suit filed against Maxwell. Those who say they are victims of Epstein and other eyewitnesses to the events surrounding his alleged crimes have testified that Maxwell's role was in arranging massages and sexual favors for Epstein and a circle of his high-profile associates.\n\nHowever, Maxwell allegedly played an even more direct role in the sex abuse on several occasions. Maxwell and Epstein were accused of molesting two victims in 1996, but the claims, allegedly reported to the FBI, fell on deaf ears, according to an affidavit viewed by the Miami Herald. Maxwell has not released any public statements since Epstein's arrest in early July. No criminal charges have been brought against her, and she has consistently and vehemently denied all allegations of misconduct.",
    " Title: Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Seizes Yemeni Airport as Chaos Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nMilitants from the Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) have seized control of an airport in the southern Yemeni city of Mukalla, officials have reported. Troops guarding the site in Hadramawt province have fled, according to these sources.\n\nThe seizure comes as AQAP has exploited the ongoing chaos in Yemen, overrunning Mukalla earlier this month and freeing prisoners from a local jail. The Saudi-led coalition, which has been bombing Shia Houthi rebels, has been unable to prevent the militant group's advance.\n\nThe Houthis, a Zaidi Shia Muslim rebel group from the north, swept into the capital Sanaa last September, eventually forcing President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. AQAP fighters have also reportedly taken control of a sea port and an oil terminal in southern Yemen.\n\nAs the coalition strikes against the Houthis continue, Yemeni Vice-President Khaled Bahah has stated that he does not want a Saudi-led ground offensive. However, there has been speculation that a ground campaign could be launched due to the raids failing to stop the rebels. Mr. Bahah said, \"We are still hoping that nothing will happen, and we are not expanding the war, but we are trying to stop the war.\"\n\nEarlier, it was announced that the UN's special envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, has stepped down from his post. The UN stated it would name a successor \"in due course\" and \"spare no efforts to relaunch the peace process.\" The Moroccan diplomat is believed to have come under pressure to resign from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states after failing to get the warring Yemeni factions to attend peace talks.\n\nThe Houthis, who want to replace President Hadi, whose government they deem corrupt, have been expanding their control since last year. The US alleges Iran is providing military assistance to the rebels. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh's military units, who were forced to hand over power in 2011 after mass protests, are fighting alongside the Houthis. President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi fled abroad in March as the rebels advanced on Aden, where he had taken refuge in February. Sunni Muslim tribesmen and Southern separatists have formed militia to fight the rebels.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, a US-backed coalition of nine, mostly Sunni Arab states, says it is seeking to \"defend the legitimate government\" of President Hadi. AQAP opposes both the Houthis and President Hadi. A rival affiliate of Islamic State has also recently emerged.",
    " Title: Congress Faces Challenges in Preventing Russian Election Interference Ahead of Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the 2018 midterm elections approaching, Congress is grappling with the issue of preventing Russian hacking of state election systems and the spread of disinformation via social media. The challenge, analysts say, is compounded by Congress' reluctance to regulate private tech companies and states' traditional aversion to federal control over their elections.\n\nThe three congressional committees conducting investigations into Russian meddling have a broader mandate than simply preventing Kremlin-linked groups from stealing campaign emails, as they allegedly did in cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign last year. Recent revelations about the extent of Russian efforts to spread disinformation via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites underscore the complexity of the task Congress faces as it heads toward the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nEric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno, said, \"Congress may have begun its investigation looking for a nice, neat smoking keyboard, but this is not a case where you can call the vendor and get a patch to plug a security hole. This has become incredibly complicated.\"\n\nFederal officials recently informed election officials in 21 states that hackers possibly connected to Russia targeted their election systems last year. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee warned that they expect the Russians to try again in the 2018 midterm elections, the 2020 presidential election, and possibly even this year in the Virginia governor's race.\n\nSenate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) said, \"We need to be on guard.\"\n\nThe biggest risk, analysts say, is not that the Russians will help one party's candidates defeat the other's but that they will succeed in causing Americans to doubt the legitimacy of election results. Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, said, \"I don't think the Russians have a favorite political party. They do have a preference for chaos and division.\"\n\nA report released in January by the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded that Russia interfered in last year's election to boost Donald Trump and hurt Clinton. However, their goal, according to Herzik, is to disrupt the American political process and sow distrust and discontent.\n\nFacebook recently turned over more than 3,000 suspicious ads to the House Intelligence Committee. The ads were purchased by an organization that Facebook said was connected to Russian intelligence services during the 2016 election. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the committee's senior Democrat, said, \"These ads... help demonstrate how Russia employed sophisticated measures to push disinformation and propaganda to millions of Americans online during the election, in order to sow discord and chaos, and divide us from one another.\"\n\nThe House panel, along with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, is investigating Russian interference in last year's presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Both the House and Senate Intelligence committees are planning public hearings in the next few weeks with Facebook and other social media companies to examine how Russia exploited social media.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-OK), a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Homeland Security committees, said that Russians have been weighing in on Twitter on both sides of the recent dispute between President Trump and the NFL over whether players should be fired for refusing to stand during the national anthem.\n\nThe Russians' goal, Lankford said, was \"to try to just raise the noise level in America and to make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they are trying to push divisiveness in the country.\"\n\nCongress' ability to control what happens on social media is limited, and the best it can do is push tech companies to better police themselves and identify who is buying ads or pushing out false information on their sites, according to analysts. Henry Farrell, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, is more concerned about Russian efforts to hack state elections' systems.\n\n\"I think the threat to election machines is substantially more significant,\" he said. Lawmakers have been pressing the Department of Homeland Security about what federal officials are doing to prevent Russia or other foreign governments from hacking state election systems next year. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke told the Senate Homeland Security Committee recently that her agency has the resources it needs to do on-site assessments of election security for all the states that request it before the 2018 election. However, not all states have requested it, and there is still an issue with some states on whether they want that federal involvement, Duke told the senators.",
    " Title: President Obama's Fuel-Efficiency Announcement Met with Criticism Over Alleged Hypocrisy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's visit to a suburban Maryland Safeway distribution center on Tuesday to announce new fuel-efficiency standards for trucks was met with criticism due to the large caravan of 15 vehicles used for the hour-long round trip, despite the president's focus on fuel efficiency. This event follows a series of actions that critics argue do not align with the president's words, such as golfing at water-intensive courses during a California drought and serving extravagant meals at state dinners.\n\nOver the weekend, the president faced criticism for golfing at water-intensive courses in California, a state that is currently experiencing a severe drought. This occurred just a day after the president toured drought-ravaged areas of the state and called for a rethinking of water resource usage due to climate change.\n\nLast week, the White House served a 2,500-calorie meal at a state dinner in honor of French President Francois Hollande, despite the first lady Michelle Obama and the Obama administration's focus on serving nutritious food in schools. This meal, which included dry-aged rib-eye beef with blue cheese and American Osetra caviar, exceeds the calorie limit for a school lunch.\n\nRepublican strategist Ron Bonjean, former chief of staff to Sen. Jon Kyl (Arizona Republican) and communications director to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (Illinois Republican), commented on the president's actions, stating, \"Obama is losing his connection to Americans that can't afford to take long and flashy vacations. He is talking the talk on fuel efficiency, but certainly isn't walking the walk. Instead, he's taking a gas-guzzling motorcade everywhere he goes.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski told Time over the weekend that the California golf outings are the latest example of a \"brand of hypocrisy\" frequently exhibited by this White House.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment regarding Tuesday's event, and the administration declined to comment about the president's golf outings in California, according to Time.\n\nAside from golf, extravagant meals, and fuel-consuming trips, the administration has also faced hypocrisy charges on a more policy-oriented front. Critics have charged that President Obama, after repeatedly criticizing his predecessor for frequent use of executive actions, has followed a similar path.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Obama, in recent weeks, has boasted of how 2014 will be a \"year of action\" in which he'll work without Congress wherever possible, and denied that he is abusing executive authority.\n\nSpeaking at the Safeway distribution center, Mr. Obama announced a new round of fuel-economy goals the trucking industry must meet by 2025. Under current federal standards, medium and heavy-duty trucks must reduce their fuel consumption by 10 to 20 percent by 2018. The president's new proposal, which is not scheduled to be finalized until March 2016 near the end of his term, will set even more ambitious goals the trucking industry must achieve in the years after 2018.\n\n\"Improving gas mileage for these trucks is going to drive down our oil imports even further,\" Mr. Obama said. \"That reduces carbon pollution even more, cuts down on businesses' fuel costs, which should pay off in lower prices for consumers. So it's not just a win-win. It's a win-win-win.\"",
    " Title: McDonald's Wage Hike Affects Only Company-Owned Stores; NLRB Hearings Determine Joint Employer Status\n\nArticle:\n\nMcDonald's announced on Wednesday that it would raise the wages for tens of thousands of its workers nationwide. However, the company clarified that this high-profile wage hike would only apply to workers at the 10 percent of its stores that are company-owned. The remaining 90 percent of stores, which are operated by franchisees, would not be affected.\n\nThe company's press release emphasized that the franchisees operate their individual businesses and make their own decisions regarding pay and benefits for their employees. This statement underscores McDonald's distinction between itself and its franchisees, a distinction that is currently under scrutiny in a legal battle at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\n\nThe NLRB is examining the nature of McDonald's relationship with its franchisees, and the outcome could have significant implications for franchises nationwide. The question at hand is whether McDonald's is a \"joint employer\" alongside its franchisees. If the NLRB determines that McDonald's has enough control over its restaurants, it could be held liable for labor law violations.\n\nIn December, the NLRB issued complaints against the company, alleging, among other things, that it retaliated against workers who protested in favor of higher wages. If McDonald's is deemed a joint employer, it would be required to share in the liability of labor law violations. The NLRB's general counsel, Richard Griffin, is advocating for a broader definition of what it means to be a joint employer.\n\nThe question of who is a joint employer is not limited to franchisers and franchisees. The issue of the \"fissured workplace\" has become a central concern in the US labor market. David Weil, now the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor, argued in a 2014 book that businesses distancing themselves from workers through means like subcontractors and temp agencies has led to lower wages, worse benefits, and growing inequality.\n\nIn addition to the McDonald's cases, the NLRB has yet to rule on another high-stakes case involving waste management firm Browning Ferris. The question in this case is whether Browning Ferris is a joint employer and therefore has to negotiate with unionized workers at a subcontractor. The outcome of these cases could have \"cataclysmic\" effects on the nearly 9 million US workers who work in franchises, as well as the relationship between contractors and subcontractors and even between businesses and their suppliers.\n\nAs it stands now, the decision to boost pay could put franchisees in a bind. On one hand, franchisees could feel pressure to raise their own wages. On the other hand, one anonymous franchisee told the New York Times that \"business in his restaurants had been 'horrible' and that he did not see how he could increase his employees\u2019 pay.\" The question of who is a joint employer is not just about franchisers and franchisees; it is a central issue in the US labor market.",

In a conversation with his son, he expressed his frustration over the royal family's access to resources, while he struggles to make ends meet in Marion, Arkansas.\n\nThe father, who graduated during the Great Recession, has sold his own plasma for gas money and was forced to cash in his retirement to survive after being laid off in 2008. He currently works and has no savings beyond Social Security.\n\nThe father's anger is not directed at his co-workers, who are primarily immigrants, but at the corporations he believes exploit labor and the government he perceives as punishing the working poor. He identifies corporations as the root cause of his struggles, stating, \"Corporations, that's it. That's the point of the sword that's killing us.\"\n\nThis negative energy among white workers has reportedly been manipulated for political gain by a conservative alliance in media, private interests, and celebrity, often associated with Fox, Koch, and Trump. The article does not provide specific details on this conservative trifecta or their alleged manipulation of the situation.",
    " Title: U.S. Adopts \"Liberal Approach\" in Recording COVID-19 Deaths, According to Dr. Deborah Birx\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a White House Wuhan coronavirus task force briefing on Tuesday, Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the task force, stated that the United States has adopted a \"liberal approach\" in the way COVID-19 deaths are classified.\n\n\"The intent is right now if someone dies with COVID-19, we're counting that as a COVID-19 death,\" Birx said. \"There are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition and let's say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem, some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death.\"\n\nThis statement confirms that all deaths of people infected with the coronavirus, regardless of underlying conditions, are classified as COVID-19 deaths. Birx further emphasized, \"We've taken a very liberal approach to mortality.\"\n\nSeveral media personalities, including Tucker Carlson and Brit Hume, have expressed similar sentiments on social media, suggesting that conventional pneumonia deaths may be being classified as COVID-19 deaths.\n\nThe way Wuhan coronavirus deaths are counted is significant, as the \"lethality\" of the virus has been a major factor in the countrywide economic shutdown. This classification method is a topic of debate, with some arguing that it inflates the number of COVID-19 deaths, while others maintain it provides a more accurate representation of the virus's impact.\n\nAccording to the latest numbers compiled under this classification by Johns Hopkins University, there are 398,185 positive diagnoses, 21,849 recoveries, and 12,844 deaths as of the time of this article's publication.",
    " Title: America's Vision for a Peaceful and Prosperous Future\n\nArticle:\n\nIn addressing humanitarian crises, the long-term solution often involves creating conditions that allow displaced persons to safely return home and begin the process of rebuilding. America, in its pursuit of harmony and stability, is open to forming new alliances with countries where shared interests align. The history of former adversaries becoming allies demonstrates the potential for a more peaceful and just world.\n\nLooking ahead to America's 250th year, the nation envisions a world that is more peaceful, just, and free. This vision is reminiscent of the country's centennial celebration in 1876, held in Philadelphia, where inventions such as Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, Remington's first typewriter, and Thomas Edison's automatic telegraph were showcased.\n\nThe article expresses hope for the wonders America could achieve in its 250th year, including cures for illnesses, human exploration of distant worlds, reducing welfare dependency, and ensuring safety for mothers, quality education for children, and prosperous jobs for all Americans. The ultimate goal is to make America greater than ever before for all its citizens.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing that this vision can only be realized through unity and shared effort. The commonalities among Americans, such as shared blood, the American flag, and a common God, are highlighted as the foundation for achieving this vision. The article does not provide specific details on the strategies or policies America plans to implement to achieve this vision.",
    " Title: Google Employee Files Lawsuit Alleging Discrimination Against Conservative, Caucasian, and Male Employees\n\nArticle:\n\nJames Damore, the author of a controversial memo that sparked debates about gender and diversity at Google, has sued his former employer, alleging that the company discriminates against politically conservative white men. Damore, who was fired in August for internally circulating a manifesto that argued Google's gender pay gap was the result of genetic differences that tend to favor men, said in a lawsuit filed in Santa Clara Superior Court that the search giant \"singled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated\" employees who deviated from the company's view on diversity.\n\nDamore and a second plaintiff, David Gudeman, another former Google engineer, are seeking class-action status for anyone who identifies as conservative, Caucasian, or male. The men are being represented by Harmeet K. Dhillon, the Republican National Committee's committeewoman for California.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Google's management \"goes to extreme \u2014 and illegal \u2014 lengths to encourage hiring managers to take protected categories such as race and/or gender into consideration as determinative hiring factors, to the detriment of Caucasian and male employees and potential employees at Google.\" The suit alleges that the company employs illegal hiring quotas to fill its desired percentages of women and favored minority candidates, and openly shames managers of business units who fail to meet their quotas\u2014in the process, openly denigrating male and Caucasian employees as less favored than others.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that the numerical presence of women was celebrated at Google solely due to their gender, while the presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with \"boos\" during company-wide weekly meetings. Damore's lawsuit is the latest legal challenge for Google, which also faces a suit for unequal pay. Earlier this month, four women plaintiffs, as part of a revised lawsuit, alleged that the company had asked for their previous salaries and had underpaid them compared to their male counterparts.\n\nDamore's suit, which comes from the opposite end of the spectrum, was expected given his very public hiring of Dhillon in August. That month, the Dhillon Law Group published a blog post asking for anyone who had experienced illegal or retaliatory employment practices to get in touch.\n\nIn the 161-page complaint, Damore frames himself as a model Google employee who received eight performance bonuses and $150,000 per year in stock bonuses since he started working at the company in the summer of 2013. Despite this, he was terminated from his job after voicing his complaints about diversity practices and publishing his now-infamous 10-page memo, titled \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber.\"\n\nDamore also says that he felt forced to attend and participate in diversity training events and that he was threatened and insulted by his coworkers following the publishing of his memo. He included an email from another Google employee who promised to \"hound\" Damore until one of them was fired. Among the suit's more incendiary claims is that the company endorses \"blacklists,\" which are allegedly meant to highlight employees with conservative views and prevent them from receiving certain jobs or promotions. The lawsuit also alleges that the company maintains separate lists of conservative personalities, including right-wing blogger Curtis Yarvin and InfoWars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to prevent them from stepping foot on Google's campus.\n\nThe 28-year-old Damore has remained unemployed since he was terminated from Google, noting in his suit that management did not identify \"any Google policy or procedure that Damore had violated.\" Since then, he's made a slew of media appearances, started a Twitter account, and met with conservative media and political figures, including Peter Thiel, according to several sources.\n\n\"I would welcome the chance to go back to Google and I do feel like I could improve things there,\" Damore said at a press conference on Monday at Dhillon's San Francisco office. Gudeman, the other named plaintiff, did not attend the event. Gudeman, according to his LinkedIn profile, worked at Google as an engineer from November 2013 to December 2016. He is currently a self-employed software contractor and writer.\n\nDhillon spoke for much of the event as her client watched silently and chimed in only when questions were directed his way. She stressed that the suit was an employment one, and not about free speech, and that while she had had \"dozens\" of people contact her about their experiences at Google, only Damore and Gudeman were willing to be named due to fear of reprisal. With plenty of cameras rolling, Dhillon hit familiar right-wing talking points, from the virtue signaling of Hollywood and Oprah to Silicon Valley's supposedly higher tolerance for \"furry sex parties\" than conservative views, to establish that Damore's firing had been politically motivated. And Damore, she said, was not the only one to experience this at Google. Others \"wanted to put names, but there is a specific blacklisting of conservatives,\" Dhillon said. \"Nobody wants to be a martyr and nobody wants to do this to help others unless they have to do it. That\u2019s why James is here.\" Joseph Bernstein contributed additional reporting to this story.",
    " Title: China Warns of Permanent Loss of U.S. Agricultural Market Share in Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's Vice Agriculture Minister, Han Jun, has warned that the United States could permanently lose its share of the Chinese agricultural market due to the ongoing trade war. Han stated that other countries have the willingness and capacity to take over the market share currently held by the U.S., making it difficult for the U.S. to regain the market once lost.\n\nSince the trade war began in early August, China has imposed tariffs on 90% of agricultural goods imported from the U.S., with limited impact on China. Han noted that Beijing has imposed duties on 517 types of American agricultural products, including nuts, soybeans, cotton, fruit, and meat, with a combined value of approximately $21 billion last year.\n\nChina is the world's largest importer of soybeans, using them to produce cooking oil, biodiesel, and livestock feed. Han stated that China's soybean imports from the U.S. are expected to drop dramatically this year, and preparations have already been made to handle the shortfall.\n\nBefore the trade war, China was on track to import 300 million tons of soybeans from the U.S. this year. However, Han warned that the European Union would not be able to make up the losses for U.S. soybean producers, as the EU would only buy 13 to 14 million tons of soybeans a year over the next decade, compared to the more than 30 million tons of soybeans China bought from the U.S. last year.\n\nHan also warned that additional tariffs on American agricultural goods were in the pipeline, with a list of 387 types of agricultural products, including coffee, vegetables, and vegetable oils, with a total value of around $2.9 billion. As a result, almost all agricultural products China buys from the U.S. will face additional tariffs once Beijing's latest countermeasures take effect.\n\nHan admitted that Washington's tariffs would impact China's fruit, vegetable, and seafood producers, as it would not be easy for them to find alternative export destinations in the short term. However, Beijing would help exporters find other countries to sell their products to and try to boost domestic consumption instead, to minimize the impact of the tariffs.\n\nThe United States was the third-largest market for Chinese fruit and the fifth-largest for vegetables last year, with exports valued at a combined $1.84 billion.",
    " Title: California's Poverty Reduction Efforts and Occupational Licensing Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia, known for its progressive political leanings and generous social welfare programs, is considering a series of multibillion-dollar proposals to potentially eliminate childhood deep poverty, as reported by The American Prospect earlier this month. The proposals, which include expanding Medi-Cal, funding universal preschool, and investing \"major sums\" in affordable housing, are part of Governor Gavin Newsom's first budget.\n\nHowever, the idea of California eliminating childhood deep poverty is met with skepticism by some, who argue that the state's social welfare policies, which often involve increased taxes, expanded programs, and extensive regulation of the private sector, may be contributing to the high poverty rate.\n\nOne of California's poorest larger cities, Stockton, is implementing a privately funded pilot program that provides a Universal Basic Income to poor residents. The program, which offers monthly, no-strings-attached cash, has received favorable media attention.\n\nBarry Broad, who heads the California Employment Training Panel, expressed concerns about the Universal Basic Income program, stating that it undermines the \"dignity of work.\" This phrase, \"dignity of work,\" seems to be a recurring theme in the debate over California's poverty reduction strategies.\n\nOne issue that has been largely overlooked in the state's poverty reduction efforts is the onerous occupational licensing rules. California imposes strict regulations on various professions, making it difficult for low-income Californians to pursue lucrative careers.\n\nFor instance, obtaining a barbering and cosmetology degree can cost thousands of dollars, and a bill introduced last year to eliminate the 1,500 hours of schooling required to shampoo and curl people's hair for pay died in the Assembly.\n\nConservative-leaning Arizona, on the other hand, is reforming such laws. Republican Governor Doug Ducey recently signed a measure that recognizes new residents' licenses from other states. \"There's dignity in all work,\" the governor said, echoing the phrase \"dignity of work.\"\n\nCalifornia has attempted to address the licensing issue, but its approach has been criticized. In 2018, Attorney General Xavier Becerra sponsored Senate Bill 1272 to help law enforcement arrest people involved in the \"underground economy.\" Fortunately, then-Governor Jerry Brown vetoed the bill. The state also announced sting operations to catch laborers who have exceeded the $500 cap on providing unlicensed contracting.\n\nInstead of reforming its rules, California officials seem to be focusing on fining and jailing people. Backers of such work argue that it results in \"significant uncollected revenues,\" which are needed to fund anti-poverty programs. However, some question whether the best way to eliminate poverty is not through such measures, but by making it easier for people to legally pursue dignified work.\n\nThis column was first published in the Orange County Register.",
    " Title: Kellyanne Conway Suggests Undercover Voters Could Influence Trump's Election Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nKellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's campaign manager, has suggested that the Republican nominee could win the November election despite trailing in polls due to a perceived social stigma associated with supporting Trump. In an interview with Channel 4 for the documentary President Trump: Can He Really Win?, Conway outlined her vision of how Trump could secure victory by reaching \"undercover voters\" who are reluctant to express their support publicly.\n\nConway argued that Trump's support is not accurately reflected in polls because of the social stigma of supporting the Republican nominee, particularly among college-educated individuals in the United States. She stated that these undercover voters, who may not have voted Republican in the past or have not voted in a while, are tired of arguing about their support for Trump and choose not to discuss it.\n\nConway described her method of reaching these undercover voters as \"proprietary\" and said that the campaign goes to them \"where they live, literally.\" This echoes the Bradley effect, a phenomenon that describes the willingness of some white voters to tell pollsters they are voting for an African American candidate while preferring the white candidate in the voting booth.\n\nSpeaking to Channel 4 earlier this month, Conway cited the UK's experience with the EU referendum vote as evidence of silenced voices in polls that should be included. She argued that passionate voters who may vote for Trump for the first time ever are being excluded from polls.\n\nIn the past week, Trump has begun using teleprompters at every rally, despite his past criticism of the technology. This shift toward making Trump a more predictable candidate came as Conway took control of the campaign. Conway outlined the message she thought Trump should continue to emphasize: national and homeland security, economic growth and prosperity, ethics, and the dislike and distrust of Washington and its adjuncts.\n\nHowever, despite Trump's adoption of teleprompters, he still veered off script during a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday night. Trump claimed that inner cities run by Democrats are more dangerous than war zones and that, if elected, \"we'll get rid of the crime.\" He continued, saying, \"You can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.\"\n\nAs the election approaches, it remains to be seen whether Conway's strategy of reaching undercover voters will prove successful, or if Trump's penchant for controversial statements will continue to overshadow his campaign message.",
    " Title: ISIS Claims Responsibility for Texas Cartoon Contest Shooting, U.S. Authorities Investigate Links to Terrorism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a broadcast on its official radio channel Tuesday, the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the shooting outside a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, on Sunday. The group referred to the gunmen, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, as two of its soldiers. However, U.S. authorities have not confirmed the claim, and ISIS offered no evidence that the gunmen were affiliated with the terror organization.\n\nThe shooting occurred at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, where the American Freedom Defense Initiative was hosting a cartoon contest featuring depictions of the Prophet Mohammed, which many Muslims consider sacrilegious. Simpson and Soofi, who were both armed with assault rifles and body armor, drove up to the center and started shooting, striking a security guard in the ankle. Garland police returned fire, killing the gunmen before they were able to enter the building.\n\nTwo days after the attack, ISIS claimed responsibility, warning of more attacks to come. The ISIS radio announcer referred to Simpson and Soofi as the terror group's \"brothers.\" The announcement ended with a warning: \"We say to the defenders of the cross, the U.S., that future attacks are going to be harsher and worse. The Islamic State soldiers will inflict harm on you with the grace of God. The future is just around the corner.\"\n\nWhile ISIS claimed responsibility, there was no immediate indication that the terror group in Iraq and Syria had contact with Simpson or Soofi, who both lived in Phoenix. \"They may not have had formal contact (with ISIS). They may have had email communication or read communications from ISIS, but I don't think they were directed by ISIS,\" said Clemente, a former FBI agent and terrorism analyst.\n\nSimpson, who was convicted of making a false statement involving international and domestic terrorism in 2011, was sentenced to three years of probation. Soofi, on the other hand, was relatively unknown to federal investigators. Authorities knew of no indication the pair planned to launch Sunday's attack, another law enforcement official said.\n\nInvestigators are trying to ascertain whether the two gunmen had any associates in Phoenix or across the United States who share their ideology. The FBI is scrubbing the deceased attackers' electronics and interviewing friends in a bid to draw possible connections. The hard drive retrieved from their apartment is being analyzed.\n\nThe shooting fits a well-known pattern of ISIS recruitment and incitement: encouraging sympathizers via a sophisticated social media campaign to join the fight in Syria, or, if they can't, to carry out terror attacks on their own at home, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Moments before the attack, Simpson posted a tweet with the hashtag #texasattack: \"May Allah accept us as mujahideen.\" The tweet also said he and his fellow attacker had pledged allegiance to \"Amirul Mu'mineen,\" which likely refers to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe shooting stirred memories of other attacks this year in France and Denmark. In January, gunmen attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine that has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, and killed 12 people. In February, a gunman attacked a free speech forum in Copenhagen, Denmark, featuring artist Lars Vilks, who infuriated al Qaeda with his depictions of Mohammed.",
    " Title: Former Bolton Aide Declines to Testify in Impeachment Inquiry, Citing Legal Tug of War\n\nArticle:\n\nCharles Kupperman, a former deputy to former White House national security adviser John Bolton, will not testify before Congress on Monday as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. His lawyer, Charles Cooper, stated in a letter delivered Sunday to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee that Kupperman will not testify until a court rules on a lawsuit surrounding his appearance.\n\nKupperman, a private citizen, has been caught in a legal tug of war between the White House, which is trying to block his testimony citing executive privilege, and Democrats who have subpoenaed him to appear on Monday in the Capitol before the three House committees leading the impeachment probe.\n\nOn Friday, Kupperman filed a lawsuit, essentially asking the courts to rule on which side has the more compelling legal argument. In response, Democrats on the three committees warned that Kupperman's failure to appear could lead to charges of contempt of Congress.\n\n\"Notwithstanding this attempted obstruction, the duly authorized subpoena remains in full force and Dr. Kupperman remains legally obligated to appear for the deposition on Monday,\" the letter by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said. \"The deposition will begin on time, and should your client defy the subpoena, his absence will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding.\"\n\nCooper, in his letter to Daniel Noble, a Democratic attorney for the committee, said \"it is not Dr. Kupperman who contests\" the Democrats' legal claim.\n\n\"It is President Trump, and every President before him for at least the last half century, who have asserted testimonial immunity for their closest confidential advisors,\" Cooper wrote.\n\nThe White House successfully blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from appearing before Congress pursuant to a subpoena earlier this year by asserting he is immune from compelled testimony. The developments have prompted a court fight.\n\nKupperman was reportedly on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment investigation into allegations that Trump solicited foreign leaders to help his reelection in 2020.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday that Bolton is also a \"very important\" witness, and House Democrats want him to testify. However, Schiff anticipates another standoff with the White House.\n\n\"My guess is they're going to fight us having John Bolton in,\" Schiff said on ABC's \"This Week.\"",
    " Title: Iraqi Prime Minister Vows to Oppose Successor Nomination as Political Tensions Mount\n\nArticle:\n\nIraq's Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has vowed to fight the nomination of his successor, Haider al-Abadi. Al-Abadi, the deputy speaker of Parliament, is currently working to form a government following his appointment by Iraqi President Fuad Masum on Monday.\n\nThe United States has publicly endorsed al-Abadi, with President Barack Obama calling his nomination a \"promising step forward.\" Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have expressed their support for al-Abadi.\n\nAs a further incentive to quickly form a new government, the Obama administration is promising additional financial and military support in Iraq's fight against the Islamic State (IS) militants in northern Iraq. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that the United States \"stands ready to fully support a new inclusive Iraqi government.\"\n\nThe political power struggle in Iraq reached a breaking point on Monday when President Fuad Masum named al-Abadi to replace al-Maliki. Al-Maliki has vowed to fight al-Abadi's nomination.\n\nAl-Maliki could bide his time and try to divide Iraqi politicians to make it difficult for al-Abadi to muster enough support to form a government over the next 30 days, as per Iraq's Constitution. However, officials say they do not think he has enough backing to do that. A large portion of the Shia bloc, including most of his own party, is behind al-Abadi, giving the United States some confidence a government can be formed within the prescribed time frame.\n\nThe United States has increased military aid to al-Maliki's government over the past year to combat IS militants. That assistance has been stepped up over the past two months as IS forces claimed large areas of territory in northern Iraq in a brutal campaign.\n\nLast week, Obama ordered airstrikes against militant positions and humanitarian airdrops to aid thousands of the Yazidi minority under threat from the extremist group and trapped in the Sinjar Mountains. The United States is also covertly arming Kurdish Peshmerga forces battling IS.\n\nThe United States has been encouraged by unprecedented cooperation between the Iraqi military and Kurdish forces in fighting IS and helping civilians in the north. Officials said it gives them hope that Iraq's long-divided ethnic groups are finally uniting in the wake of the Islamic State threat.\n\nHowever, with its military support, Washington also risks fueling Iraq's sectarian divide. Between additional backing for a new Iraqi Shia-led government and its direct support for the Kurds, the United States risks pushing Iraq's Sunni population toward IS, which is also Sunni, because they will see that support as taking sides in what is widely viewed as a civil war.\n\nAl-Abadi is a Shia, from the same party as al-Maliki, serving at one time as his aide. However, it remains to be seen whether al-Abadi can unite the country and fight off the sweeping Islamic State advance.\n\nKurt Sowell, editor of the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, stated, \"Abadi has never been involved in personal controversy. He is someone who really has tried to tow a straight line. I think he is someone who will try to be inclusive and work with people. But at the same time, he's never been someone to push for reform.\"\n\nWhile al-Abadi may not be viewed as a transformational figure, the United States has been impressed with the way he stood up to al-Maliki politically and accumulated support of many Shia. \"Sometimes what is needed is a good bureaucrat who can get things back on track,\" one senior State Department official said. \"We don't need anymore personalities.\"\n\nIf al-Maliki is able to keep al-Abadi from forming a government, Iraqi politicians would be back to Square One, and the United States would be forced to choose between supporting al-Maliki's caretaker government, despite its stated reservations about him, or waiting until a new prime minister is designated who can form a government. If IS continues to advance, however, neither the Iraqis nor the United States will have the luxury of time.",
    " Title: Warren's Exit from 2020 Race and Its Impact on Sanders and Biden\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump accused Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) of single-handedly affecting the outcome of Senator Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) second presidential campaign by not dropping out before Super Tuesday. Trump made the claim in a tweet on Monday, stating that if Warren had withdrawn from the race three days earlier, Sanders could have won more states on Super Tuesday.\n\nSanders, who is known for his fiery campaign style and has expressed disdain for the Democratic Party establishment, has directed his ire toward former Vice President Joe Biden and the powerbrokers rallying behind him following his Super Tuesday wins that placed him in a delegate lead.\n\nWarren, who dropped out of the presidential race last week after the delegate-rich Super Tuesday primaries, has not yet endorsed either Biden or Sanders.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, Sanders won four races, including California, his home state of Vermont, Utah, and Colorado. Biden, after a slow start, won 10 primary races, including the final primary of the early nominating calendar - South Carolina - and primaries across the South.\n\nWarren had a disappointing performance on Super Tuesday, finishing third in her home state of Massachusetts. Upon suspending her campaign, Warren did not endorse any candidate, unlike other former 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Warren has been considered ideologically closer to Sanders, but the two have clashed in recent weeks. It remains unclear whether Warren is leaning toward endorsing one candidate or the other.\n\nBiden has since received endorsements from Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Warren, in her farewell speech, addressed sexism in the race and promised she would have \"more to say\" later. She also expressed disappointment about the lack of a female candidate in the race, referring to the prospects for a history-making first female president being essentially gone. Warren also did not endorse any candidate upon suspending her campaign.",
    " Title: President Trump Blocks Release of Democratic Counter-Memo on FBI and Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Friday prevented the release of a classified memo written by Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, which was intended to counter a Republican document that he allowed to be made public last week. The Republican president's decision, the latest controversy related to an investigation that has overshadowed his year in office, has infuriated Democrats.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer stated, \"Millions of Americans are asking one simple question: what is he hiding?\" White House Counsel Don McGahn explained that the Justice Department identified portions of the 10-page memo that \"would create especially significant concerns for the national security and law enforcement interests\" of the country.\n\nA week earlier, Trump had overruled similar objections from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department about releasing the memo written by the same committee's Republican members, which took aim at senior law enforcement officials.\n\nThe White House also released a letter from the FBI director and the department's No. 2 official expressing concern about its release in relation to protecting U.S. intelligence sources and methods.\n\nThe committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff, stated that the memo Trump blocked puts forth facts that the public needs to know, including that the FBI acted properly in seeking permission from a special court for surveillance of Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser with ties to Russia.\n\nSchiff said the committee's Democrats \"take seriously\" the Justice Department and FBI concerns and will review their recommended redactions. He hopes the matter can be resolved quickly so the committee can return to the Russia investigation.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee voted unanimously on Monday to release the document drafted by the panel's Democrats, contingent on the Republican president agreeing to reclassify it.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. February 9, 2018. (Photo by Jonathan Ernst)\n\nThe Republican memo portrayed the Russia investigation as a product of political bias at the FBI and Justice Department against Trump. The president said the document \"totally vindicates\" him in the Russia investigation, a claim disputed by Democrats and some Republicans.\n\nDemocrats last week warned Trump against using the Republican memo as a pretext to fire Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and oversees the investigation, or to remove Mueller himself. The Republican memo singled out Rosenstein and several other officials by name, including former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired in May 2017, as the agency investigated the Russia matter.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign using hacking and propaganda, an effort that eventually included attempting to tilt the race in Trump's favor.

This data is culled from a variety of sources.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, during a coronavirus task force daily briefing, stated, \"We're testing a tremendous number of people.\" He also questioned the data coming out of China. Vice President Mike Pence announced that more than 552,000 tests have been conducted in the U.S. to date, with a 14.9% rate of positives for every coronavirus test administered.\n\nThe U.S. death total of 1,177 is the sixth-highest in the world, suggesting the U.S. healthcare system is helping keep Americans alive at a higher rate than European countries. The U.S. confirmed-case death rate is just 1.4%, while the other most-infected countries are far less effective in keeping their infected citizens alive.\n\nAt the White House task force's daily news conference on Thursday, officials identified Chicago and Detroit areas as potential new hot spots for the virus in the U.S. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus response, told reporters that officials are concerned about rapid increases in cases in Cook County, Ill., and Wayne County, Mich.\n\nThe Seattle area, where many early cases centered around an adult care facility, also remains a hot spot. Rising fast in infections is New Orleans, in part because of last month's Carnival festivities there offering a ripe opportunity for the virus to spread widely. New Orleans has the world's highest growth rate for virus cases, with the metro area accounting for some 70% of the roughly 1,800 cases in Louisiana.\n\nU.S. Army leaders said Thursday that two field hospitals are on their way to New York City and will be able to begin treating patients at the Javits Center on Monday. The Army combat units from Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky, will include as many as 700 personnel and almost 300 beds. These medical personnel will also be able to help staff additional beds and medical equipment that are being brought in by state and local authorities.\n\nAn Army combat hospital from Fort Carson, Colorado, is also heading to Seattle.

Agree on Need for Temporary Worker Visa Program, Remain Divided on Visa Quantity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe visa program for low-skilled, year-round, temporary workers has emerged as a significant point of contention. In February, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. reached a compromise acknowledging the need for a system that addresses business demands for lower-skilled labor while safeguarding American workers. However, the two groups remain divided on the number of visas the new program should offer, according to Randel K. Johnson, the chamber's lead negotiator on immigration. The chamber seeks 400,000 visas, while the A.F.L.-C.I.O. prefers a number in the \"very, very low five figures.\" Ana Avenda\u00f1o, the director of immigration for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., declined to discuss a specific number but stated, \"the whole notion is to create a system that responds to the needs of the economy.\"\n\nIn addition to the visa program, a bipartisan group of eight senators is still debating improvements to E-Verify, the system employers use to check the immigration status of their workers. A high-tech, biometric identification card was deemed too costly; instead, the group is considering an enhanced E-Verify system that would allow employers to use photographs to identify job applicants and would let workers provide answers to security questions to help prove their legal work status.\n\nDespite remaining differences, the eight senators in negotiations are reportedly making steady progress toward an overall deal, according to people familiar with the talks. President Obama, who has threatened to push forward with his own legislation if Senate efforts stall, is content with the current pace of talks, White House officials said.\n\nIf the Senate passes an immigration overhaul later this spring or summer, it still faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House. A group of House Republicans told Speaker John A. Boehner last week that they were close to releasing a set of principles to guide their own legislation. House Republicans prefer to tackle an immigration overhaul in several smaller bills rather than one comprehensive bill. Furthermore, many House Republicans want to offer illegal immigrants a legal status that falls short of a pathway to citizenship.\n\nHowever, the most apparent momentum seems to be the progress among senators on the path to citizenship. No immigration debate has been more contentious over the years than the question of whether, and how, illegal immigrants eventually become citizens.",
    " Title: Trump Kicks Off 2020 Presidential Re-election Campaign in Orlando, Florida\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday night, former President Donald Trump officially commenced his 2020 re-election campaign in Orlando, Florida. The event, held in a 20,000-seat arena, served as a trial run for Trump's pitch to the American people for another term, following a series of campaign-style rallies across key battleground states.\n\nTrump's speech, lasting 78 minutes, offered insights into his potential campaign strategy. The economy, regulation-cutting, military spending, trade negotiations, tax reform, border security, and judicial appointments were among the topics discussed, all of which received a positive response from the audience.\n\nRobert Adamson, an insurance salesman from Merritt Island, Florida, expressed his support for Trump, stating, \"This is the only platform he really gets where he gets a fair shake at being able to divulge his achievements.\"\n\nThe Trump phenomenon extends beyond policy, as Vice-President Mike Pence noted in his introductory speech. Trump's success is attributed to his ability to connect with his supporters, making them feel part of his movement. This connection was evident in Orlando, with supporters praising Trump's relatable demeanor and unpolished style.\n\nThe audience's response to Trump's speech suggested that the overriding theme of his re-election campaign will be a bid for vindication, targeting his critics in the media, the Democratic Party, and the nation's elite. Trump framed this vindication as a victory for his supporters, reminding them of the derogatory label \"deplorables\" used by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe president also made ominous warnings of what could happen if Democrats defeat him in 2020, stating, \"They are trying to erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election probably in the history of the country.\"\n\nOutside the arena, a handful of anti-Trump protesters voiced their opposition, while Democratic state legislator Amy Mercado from Orlando expected Trump to \"throw red meat\" to his base. However, she added that the president not only motivates his own base but also the opposition, with the 2020 election potentially coming down to a battle of turnout and passion.\n\nIn Orlando, Trump demonstrated his ability to draw a large, enthusiastic crowd eager for the political battles to come. The enthusiasm among Trump's base for his rhetoric and pugilistic attitude remains strong, despite polls indicating an uphill road ahead for the president. In fact, the enthusiasm may be greater due to the pessimistic polls, fueled by the us-against-them nature of the undertaking.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Increased Tariffs on Chinese Imports, Citing Trade Imbalance and Chinese Noncompliance\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Sunday that the U.S. will increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent, effective this Friday. This move comes as a response to what the administration perceives as China's economic aggression and malfeasance, and Beijing's reported slow pace in trade negotiations.\n\nThe new tariff rate will apply to a combined total of $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, representing 46 percent of the $540 billion in goods the U.S. imported from China in 2018. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on the remaining half of imports yet to face higher levies.\n\nChina's ability to retaliate is limited due to the lopsided nature of the trade relationship, with the U.S. exporting only $120 billion in goods to China last year, less than a quarter of what was imported from them. The tariffs are intended to pressure China into recognizing the need for change in their economic practices.\n\nThe Trump administration has identified several areas of concern in the U.S.-China trade relationship, including cyber intrusions, market-distorting subsidies and state-owned enterprises, forced transfer of U.S. business technology, outright theft of intellectual property, currency manipulation, and the export of deadly fentanyl.\n\nThe administration has also highlighted China's history of violating agreements made with the U.S. and its allies. For example, China reneged on promises not to militarize the South China Sea and to stop cyber attacks against the U.S. China also went back on its promise to Great Britain to respect the freedom and relative autonomy of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that U.S. tariffs remain on Chinese goods until China demonstrates changed behavior, not just promises of change. This has been a sticking point in negotiations with China's diplomats, who are accustomed to western leaders accepting a deal for the photo opportunity it produces, and then overlooking Chinese noncompliance.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated last week that the trade team would soon \"either recommend to the president we have a deal or make a recommendation that we don't.\" Given Chinese intransigence and duplicity, it appears that the latter conclusion may carry the day.\n\nRather than caving in or walking away, Trump has increased the pressure on China with the new tariffs, giving Beijing another chance to understand that the old days of weak U.S. negotiation tactics are over. If China fails to shape up, it will face the consequences of more economic pain, as it contributes to the U.S. Treasury through higher tariffs.\n\nChristian Whiton, a senior advisor in the Donald Trump and George W. Bush administrations, is a senior fellow for strategy and public diplomacy at the Center for the National Interest and the author of \"Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.\"",
    " Title: Income Inequality in the U.S. Reaches Record High, Top 1% Captures More Than Half of National Income\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a new analysis by economist Emmanuel Saez, Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the country's income distribution saw their take-home pay rise 3.9 percent in 2015 over 2014 levels, adjusted for inflation, marking the best increase in 17 years. However, the top 1 percent of the country far outpaced them, with their income growing by 7.7 percent last year, reaching a new high.\n\nWhile the past two years have been good for the majority of Americans' income growth, they have not fully recovered from the recession. For the bottom 99 percent, incomes fell 11.6 percent during the height of the recession from 2007 to 2009. Afterward, they grew just 7.6 percent between 2009 and 2015, not enough to make up for the downturn. Incomes for the 99 percent have only recovered about 60 percent of what they lost.\n\nOn the other hand, the rich are doing great. The incomes of the 1 percent grew 37 percent between 2009 and 2015. They captured more than half of all the income growth in the country over that period, leaving just 48 percent to spread out among the bottom 99 percent of families.\n\nThe top 10 percent of American earners took home more than half of all income last year, the highest share ever except for 2012.\n\nIncome inequality is now at the highest level the country has ever recorded in its entire history. While most data only goes back to the turn of the 20th century, economists Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson used tax records, directories, and historical accounts to go back even further. They found that in the country's earliest post-colonial history, inequality was quite low and much lower than countries across the Atlantic.\n\nAs the country's economy rapidly expanded in the 1800s, inequality rose alongside it. Even so, at the heights of that era's inequality, it never reached the levels we see today.\n\n\"We went from one of the most egalitarian places in the world to one of the least,\" Williamson told the Washington Post. \"What happened?\"\n\nMany factors have contributed to growing income inequality, but a lot of them have to do with taxes. Since the late 1990s, income inequality has been driven by the rich getting more and more of their money from returns on investments, something the less well-off are less likely to benefit from, and that money is taxed at a lower rate. Overall, taxes and public programs are doing much less than they used to to mitigate the growth of income inequality as taxes have been lowered on the rich while lawmakers have withered the social safety net.",
    " Title: Job Growth Rebounds in March, Easing Concerns of Slowing Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nEmployment growth rebounded in March, with employers adding 196,000 jobs, according to the U.S. Labor Department's report released on Friday. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.8%. The job gains for January and February were revised up by a modest 14,000.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated 175,000 jobs were added last month. Payroll growth was feeble in February, with just 33,000 additions, but that was largely attributed to severe weather conditions.\n\nHealth care and social assistance led the job gains with 61,000. Professional and business services added 37,000; leisure and hospitality, 33,000; and construction, 16,000. Manufacturing cut 6,000 jobs, indicating the struggling global economy and U.S. trade fight with China are taking a bigger toll. Retail, which is shrinking as shoppers shift their purchases online, cut 12,000 jobs after shedding 20,000 in February.\n\nThe average hourly earnings rose 4 cents to $27.70, lowering the annual gain from a 10-year high of 3.4% to 3.2%. Wage growth has picked up as employers compete for a dwindling supply of available workers. The faster pay increases haven't yet prompted most companies to pass their rising labor costs onto consumers through higher prices, keeping inflation subdued.\n\nHowever, further earnings gains could lead to stronger inflation, posing a dilemma for the Federal Reserve that has vowed to remain patient and forecast no interest rate hikes this year. The March jobs report helps keep the Fed in its market-friendly wait-and-see mode.\n\nThe share of American adults working or looking for jobs fell to 63% from 63.2%. This could indicate that labor force participation is resuming its longer-term decline as baby boomers retire. A lower participation rate means a smaller labor supply for employers, which could push up wages and inflation further.\n\nThis was about as ideal a jobs report as markets could expect. Job growth bounced back forcefully from its poor February performance, alleviating worries of an imminent downturn in the economy. Yet, yearly wage growth, while still healthy, retreated some from the 10-year high reached two months ago. That should keep the Fed on hold for now. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 20 points, or less than 0.1%, in mid-day trading.\n\nThe report offers no reason for the Fed to consider cutting rates, as President Trump has urged. \"Today's data supports our call that the Fed's next move is more likely to be a hike than a cut,\" Bank of America wrote in a research note.",
    " Title: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Defends GOP Tax Overhaul Plan Amid Middle-Class Tax Increase Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Kevin Brady, the House's top tax-code writer, defended the chamber's tax overhaul plan on Sunday, countering criticism that many middle-class Americans will pay more, potentially turning voters against the Republican Party. Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Fox News Sunday that he believes there is tax relief for families across various income levels.\n\nThe lawmaker's defense comes in response to criticism from congressional Democrats and two analyses, including one in The New York Times that concluded one-third of middle-class families will face a tax increase. Brady disputed the analysis, stating, \"They're describing an America that doesn't exist\u2014one where the economy never grows and one where your paycheck stays stagnant no matter what happens.\"\n\nSenate Democrats have also criticized any GOP plan that will eliminate state and local tax deductions, warning that congressional Republicans representing suburban districts will face voter backlash for their support. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told Fox on Sunday, \"The reality is many middle-class families are going to end up paying more.\"\n\nThe GOP-controlled House and Senate have each introduced separate plans, which must pass in each chamber before leaders can craft a compromise bill that gets passed by the entire Congress and put on President Trump's desk before the end of the year. The major differences between the plans include the Senate bill wanting to delay a corporate tax cut by one year and eliminate all state and local tax deductions.\n\nBrady emphasized the common ground between the plans, stating, \"There are some [differences], but there is far more common ground.\" He also essentially guaranteed the House plan will keep some state and local deductions and was optimistic about his committee voting on the plan in the coming days, with final passage before a self-imposed Thanksgiving deadline.\n\nBrady also disputed analysis that the GOP plan will increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion, arguing that critics don't take into account that the tax cuts will stimulate economic growth. Brady repeated what House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and others in the GOP leadership have said about the plan, stating that it increases paychecks and allows Americans to decide what to do with their money before the IRS gets its hands on it.",
    " Title: George Washington University Law Professor Warns of Dangerous Precedent in President Obama's Executive Order on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Barack Obama prepares to issue an executive order on immigration that could potentially legalize five million undocumented immigrants, the move has sparked criticism from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nOn Friday, George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, who identifies as a liberal, appeared on The Kelly File to discuss the issue. Turley expressed concern that the President's actions could violate the separation of powers and warned that the country is at a \"tipping point.\"\n\n\"What I'm hearing certainly causes great concern that he will again violate the separation of powers,\" Turley said. \"No president can take on the power of all three branches, and that's what he seems to be doing. He certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority. He is not being particularly coy about this, you know he says 'this is what I wanted to get out of legislation and I'm going to do it on my own,' and that does become a government of one.\"\n\nTurley also cautioned the President against ignoring the results of the 2014 midterm elections by going around Congress on this issue, despite partisan disagreements.\n\n\"It's a very sad moment, but it's becoming a particularly dangerous moment if the president is going to go forward, particularly after this election, to defy the will of Congress yet again,\" Turley continued. \"I can understand the frustration, these are two political parties that can't get along, but as you said, we have a democratic process, and a Congress that's coming in with the full voice of the American people behind them, that's what an election is, you may disagree with the outcome, but you have to respect the outcome.\"\n\n\"What the President is suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution,\" Turley added. \"We have a separation of powers that gives us balance, and that doesn't protect the branches. It's not there to protect the executive branch or the legislative branch, it's there to protect liberty.\"\n\n\"I always tell my friends on the Democratic side, we will rue the day when we helped create this uber presidency,\" he said. \"What the Democrats are creating is something very, very dangerous. They're creating a president who can go at it alone, and to go at it alone is something that is a very dangerous thing that the framers sought to avoid in our Constitution.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Overturning of DOMA: Implications and Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on Wednesday marks a significant victory for advocates of same-sex marriage. The 1996 federal law, which confined marriage to a man and a woman, has been declared unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision does not establish a national constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it does make married gay couples living in states where their unions are legal eligible for federal benefits already enjoyed by married heterosexual Americans. These benefits range from public employee benefits and bankruptcy to estate taxes and immigration.\n\nThe DOMA case involved a claim by a New York woman who, on the death of her legal same-sex spouse, paid $363,000 more in federal estate taxes than would have been collected from a heterosexual surviving spouse.\n\nFred Sainz of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy organization, states, \"Legally married couples in states that allow same-sex marriage are good to go. The court's decision will be final in 25 days, and they should start seeing all the same federal rights and benefits.\"\n\nHowever, complications arise for legally married couples living in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage. Twelve states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage; the Supreme Court's Wednesday decision also effectively made California the 13th state with legal same-sex marriage by rejecting a high court challenge to a lower court-ordered right.\n\nThe tricky part in the fall of DOMA involves how states and federal agencies currently recognize marriage. Some federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense, adhere to a \"place of celebration\" standard, meaning no matter where a couple is legally married anywhere in the world, the union is recognized for the purpose of federal benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, other agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration, hew to a \"place of residence\" standard. Marriage has to be recognized in the place the couple is living for them to be eligible for those federal spousal benefits.\n\nBoth Sainz and Ari Ezra Waldman, legal editor at Towleroad, a widely read LGBT-oriented website, predict crucial roles can be played by both the Obama administration and Congress.\n\nSame-sex marriage advocates predict, however, that with a Republican-dominated House, congressional action to resolve marriage definition disparities baked into law is unlikely. Congressional Democrats have written legislation that would uniformly apply a place of celebration standard, but it's unlikely to move beyond the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nThe task of implementing the court's decision falls to the Obama administration, which has shown a commitment to federal equality, according to Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, the nation's oldest organization working for gay rights. President Obama has directed the Attorney General to review all relevant federal statutes to ensure the decision, including its implications for federal benefits and obligations, is implemented swiftly and smoothly.\n\n\"The administration can and should adopt a universal regulation that marriages, for federal purposes, are recognized under a state of celebration standard,\" says Waldman. \"Administrations have had the power to do that since the New Deal.\"\n\n\"If someone has a problem with that, then it should be up to them to challenge the changes,\" he said. \"It's a great day, but we have more litigation, more rule-making, and more work to do.\"",
    " Title: Military Leaders' Support for Trump Met with Skepticism Amidst Past Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to a major policy speech on the state of the U.S. military, former President Donald Trump released a letter signed by 88 retired generals and admirals, aiming to demonstrate his support within military leadership. However, the media's response to the letter has been critical, with several outlets scrutinizing the backgrounds and past controversies of some of the signatories.\n\nThe letter, which praised Trump as a commander in chief capable of dealing with \"enemies of this country [who] have been emboldened\" by perceived weakness in Washington, was met with immediate skepticism. The Washington Post, for instance, highlighted retired Lt. Gen. William G. \"Jerry\" Boykin, who was reprimanded for disclosing classified information in a 2008 memoir. Boykin, a co-founder and former commander of the elite Delta Force, has a storied career that includes missions in Iran, North Korea, Somalia, and Colombia.\n\nBoykin's past statements have also been controversial. In 2003, he angered Muslims worldwide when he said, \"I knew that my God was a real God, and his was an idol.\" Boykin, who had become the executive vice president at the conservative Family Research Council by the time the Pentagon investigated him, has maintained that the disclosures were permitted and suggested that the probe was politically motivated.\n\nThe Daily Beast also investigated the list of signatories and reported that four had been involved in the 1991 Tailhook Association scandal, in which more than 100 Navy and Marine Corps aviation officers were alleged to have sexually assaulted 90 people at the 35th Annual Tailhook Association Symposium in Las Vegas. None of the signatories were charged, although one later served as a Navy lawyer in the case.\n\nThe Washington Post attempted to create a rift between Trump and his military backers by noting that retired four-star Army Gen. Burwell Bell III was once a top NATO commander, while Trump has questioned NATO's usefulness. Three other four-star generals supporting Trump \"all retired more than 20 years ago,\" the Post wrote.\n\nCNN's Anderson Cooper interviewed retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who dismissed the names on Trump's list, stating, \"I didn't recognize many of those names as being there in the fight with me over the last 16 years... There are not a whole lot of names in the fight against Al Qaeda or several of the other forces.\"\n\nHillary Clinton, Trump's opponent in the November presidential race, also expressed skepticism, stating, \"Compare where Trump is with where both Romney and McCain were... They had between 300 and 500 [supporters]. I am doing better than any Democrat. He is doing worse than recent Republicans.\"\n\nFor his part, Trump thanked the military brass for their support. \"I thank each of them for their service and their confidence in me to serve as commander in chief,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Keeping our nation safe and leading our armed forces is the most important responsibility of the presidency.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Federal Workers' Data Breach: 4 Million Records Compromised, Suspected Chinese Hackers Involved\n\nArticle:\n\nChina-based hackers are suspected of breaching the computer networks of the U.S. government personnel office, resulting in the theft of identifying information of at least 4 million federal workers, American officials announced on Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated in a statement that data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Interior Department had been compromised.\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating the incident to determine how and why it occurred, according to the statement. The hackers are believed to be based in China, as stated by Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and member of the Senate intelligence committee.\n\nCollins described the breach as \"yet another indication of a foreign power probing successfully and focusing on what appears to be data that would identify people with security clearances.\" A U.S. official, who chose to remain anonymous, suggested that the data breach could potentially affect every federal agency. One key question is whether intelligence agency employee information was stolen, and if former government employees are also affected.\n\nKen Ammon, chief strategy officer of Xceedium, stated that the attack fits the pattern of those carried out by nation states for the purpose of espionage. The stolen information could be used to impersonate or blackmail federal employees with access to sensitive information, he said.\n\nThe OPM is the human resources department for the federal government and conducts background checks for security clearances. The agency stated it is offering credit monitoring and identity theft insurance for 18 months to individuals potentially affected. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents workers in 31 federal agencies, is encouraging members to sign up for the monitoring as soon as possible.\n\nIn November, another cyberbreach compromised the private files of more than 25,000 DHS workers and thousands of other federal employees. DHS said its intrusion detection system, known as EINSTEIN, identified the hack of OPM's systems and the Interior Department's data center, which is shared by other federal agencies.\n\nIt remains unclear why the EINSTEIN system did not detect the breach until after so many records had been copied and removed. DHS is continuing to monitor federal networks for any suspicious activity and is working aggressively with the affected agencies to conduct investigative analysis to assess the extent of this alleged intrusion, according to the statement.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the hack \"shocking,\" as Americans may expect that federal computer networks are maintained with state-of-the-art defenses. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., stated that the government must overhaul its cybersecurity defenses, as the current response can no longer simply be notifying people after their personal information has been stolen. Instead, the focus should be on preventing these breaches in the first place.",
    " Title: South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn's Endorsement of Biden and the Democratic Establishment's Support\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary race. According to exit polls, 61% of voters said Clyburn's endorsement was an \"important factor\" in their decision, and 27% said it was \"the most important factor.\" Clyburn explained that Biden is his friend and has been a reliable vote for government programs that benefit the African-American community. He also argued that with Biden on the ticket, reelection prospects for congressmen and congresswomen running for election down the ticket would be better.\n\n\"We need to keep the House Speakership under Nancy Pelosi,\" said Clyburn.\n\nThe Democratic establishment is now largely backing Biden and pushing out Senator Bernie Sanders. However, the differences between a President Biden and a President Sanders in terms of policy outcomes may not be as significant as some might think. According to American Enterprise Institute economist Mark Perry, in 1950, transfer payments made up less than 20% of the federal budget, but by 2012, they were 70%.\n\nFormer Senate Banking Committee chairman Phil Gramm and former Bureau of Labor Statistics assistant commissioner John Early have highlighted the extent to which government now redistributes economic resources, or in other words, the level of socialism in the United States, in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion column. They noted that more than 80% of all taxes are paid by households with incomes in the top 40%, and more than 70% of government transfer payments go to households with incomes in the bottom 40%.\n\nPrograms like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps, which make up around 95 federal programs, are significant contributors to this redistribution. The average household income in the bottom 20% is $4,908, and this household receives $45,389 in government transfers, according to Gramm and Early. Unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare are around $50 trillion, which is more than twice the annual GDP.\n\nThe question of whether President Biden or President Sanders would introduce reforms to bring more market forces into the picture is uncertain. However, it is worth noting that the unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare are significant, and government will need to take more taxes to keep these programs going, which would mean more socialism.\n\nStar Parker, president of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education, argues that socialism and charity are fundamentally different. While charity is voluntary, individualized, and motivated by personal caring, socialism is an atheistic institutionalized system that pretends to solve human challenges through politics. Socialism, she contends, ultimately destroys the human spirit and is the real problem in poor communities.",
    " Title: South Korea's Successful Response to COVID-19: A Case Study\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Korea, which reported its first coronavirus case on the same day as the United States (Jan. 20), has managed to limit the spread of the virus and deaths in contrast to the U.S. By April 2, the U.S. had more than 240,000 cases and over 5,800 deaths, while South Korea had fewer than 10,000 confirmed cases and 169 deaths. The difference lies in South Korea's early and aggressive approach to testing, contact tracing, and isolation.\n\nIn early January, South Korea began developing and stockpiling test kits as soon as Chinese scientists released the virus's genetic code, before a single Korean had been infected. When the first case appeared, authorities started tracking the health of some 3,000 people who had traveled to Wuhan over the previous two weeks. The country assembled a vast public-private network to produce and administer tests, including drive-through centers, and established labs to process them.\n\nAn outbreak in Daegu, the third-largest city, caused by a \"super-spreader\" who infected hundreds of people at several services at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, led to a surge in cases. Over 10 days, cases soared from fewer than 50 to more than 5,000. South Korea quickly increased testing to some 20,000 people a day, but it also took more extreme measures.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in allowed the use of invasive surveillance tactics to track worshippers at Shincheonji churches across the country. South Korea's phone companies have each user's national ID number, allowing authorities to follow the movements of infected people and identify those they had interacted with over the past 14 days. Those contacts were then told to self-isolate and report their temperatures daily. Their compliance was voluntary, but South Koreans know the government can monitor their movements through phone data and an extensive CCTV network of 8 million cameras.\n\nOther Asian countries with effective responses to the pandemic are Singapore, Vietnam, and Taiwan. All were previously hit by the 2003 epidemic of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a terrifying 10% fatality rate. Because of swift measures in affected areas, it killed just 774 people. In the aftermath, all three countries adopted new health policies involving mask wearing, testing, and tracking.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, populations in those countries had masks at home, and high enough levels of social trust to quickly obey government orders to report for testing and stay at home. Taiwan has had just five deaths from COVID-19; Singapore has had six. \"The situation in [Western] countries now resembles the situation we were in during the first few weeks of the SARS spread in Taiwan in early 2003,\" Su Ih-jen of Taiwan's CDC told the Financial Times. \"You are not ready, you have no experience.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's failure to test and impose distancing rules for two months let the virus gain a foothold and led to the current exponential increase in cases. However, it's not too late to implement much wider testing. South Korea has tested 1 in every 119 of its people. The U.S. says it has performed 1.2 million tests, but since each patient is given at least two tests, that works out to fewer than 1 in 500 Americans. Most Americans who suspected they were infected have not been able to get tested. At this point, with more than 300,000 known infections and probably far more, tracking contacts will be impossible. \"To try to do contact tracing on thousands on thousands of people is like trying to do the census in a couple of hours,\" says Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. And the U.S.'s culture of individualism and states' rights make it unsuited to extensive contact tracing, surveillance of infected people, and other extreme measures. Governors in eight states were still resisting pleas this week by federal health officials that they issue mandatory stay-at-home orders, citing fears of infringing on \"personal liberty.\" Even when he finally surrendered to pressure, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2014who earlier allowed spring breakers to party on beaches for weeks\u2014exempted religious services. \"I do not think that the government has the authority to close a church,\" DeSantis said.",

Pelosi is set to assume the role of House speaker on Thursday.\n\nRegarding impeachment, Pelosi said, \"We'll have to wait and see what comes from Robert Mueller's probe of contacts between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.\" Democrats, who will now control the House, are expected to initiate impeachment proceedings as per the U.S. Constitution.\n\nPelosi, who previously described impeachment as a \"divisive activity,\" has been cautious about using the term during the 2018 midterms due to potential political backlash. However, she did not shy away from the topic on Thursday, stating, \"We should not be impeaching for a political reason, and we should not avoid impeachment for a political reason.\"\n\nThe question of whether a sitting president can be indicted is unclear, with Justice Department guidelines suggesting it is not possible. Pelosi referred to this as an \"open discussion\" and added, \"Everything indicates that a president can be indicted after he is no longer president.\"\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing in the campaign or with his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations.\n\nPelosi also addressed the ongoing U.S.-Mexico border wall dispute and the government shutdown. Trump has stated that the shutdown will last \"as long as it takes\" to secure funding for the wall. Pelosi told Guthrie, \"How many more times can we say no?\" She added, \"There is no amount of persuasion he can use.\"\n\nPelosi noted that negotiating with Trump is challenging, stating, \"He resists science, evidence, data, truth.\" She added, \"It's hard to pin the president down on the facts.\"\n\nIn response to criticism from Trump regarding her holiday trip to Hawaii while he canceled his planned visit to Florida due to the shutdown, Pelosi said, \"The president may not know this, but Hawaii is part of the United States of America.\" She also stated that she was available on 24-hour notice.",
    " Title: Justice Department Indicates Special Counsel's Russia Investigation is Near Completion\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Special Counsel's Russia investigation, which has been ongoing for nearly two years, is \"close to being completed,\" according to Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on Monday. This marks the first official statement from the Justice Department regarding the status of the investigation into potential coordination between Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nWhitaker's comments, made at the end of an unrelated news conference in Washington, represent a departure from the department's usual practice of maintaining silence on the matter. He provided no timetable for the conclusion of the investigation.\n\nTo date, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has charged 34 individuals, including several close to the president, but has yet to accuse anyone from the Trump campaign of conspiring with the Kremlin to influence the election. Whitaker, who is seen as a Trump ally, took over the Justice Department and oversight of the Mueller probe following the resignation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions at Trump's request in November.\n\nWhitaker has faced criticism for not recusing himself from the Russia investigation, despite his past public criticisms of it. A top justice department ethics official advised him to step aside out of \"an abundance of caution,\" but Whitaker declined to do so.\n\nAccording to justice department regulations, Mueller must provide a report to the attorney general at the conclusion of his investigation detailing his prosecution decisions. However, the form the report will take and whether it will be released publicly remains unclear. The report's completion may not occur under Whitaker, as Trump has nominated William Barr to serve as the next attorney general. Barr's confirmation hearing was held this month, and he is awaiting a Senate vote.\n\nBarr has expressed a desire to release as much information as possible about Mueller's findings, but has been vague on specifics. Trump has repeatedly referred to the Russia investigation as a \"witch-hunt\" and maintains there was no collusion.\n\nEvidence so far indicates that a broad range of Trump associates had Russia-related contacts during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition period, and several have been found to have lied about the communication. These contacts occurred while the Russian government was carrying out a multifaceted effort to influence the 2016 presidential campaign and sway it in Trump's favor, according to Mueller's indictments and US intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Friday, longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone became the sixth Trump associate to be charged by Mueller. Stone is expected to plead not guilty to charges of lying to lawmakers, engaging in witness tampering, and obstructing a congressional investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIn a departure from typical behavior for defendants facing charges, Stone has opted to speak publicly about the case, holding an impromptu news conference outside a Florida courthouse, appearing on weekend television interviews, and posting on Instagram.\n\nAdditionally, on Monday, a judge delayed the sentencing of Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort in Virginia, as a judge in Washington decides whether Manafort intentionally lied to investigators. Manafort was convicted of eight financial crimes last year.",
    " Title: Stagnant Wages Persist Despite Economic Recovery, Affecting American Households and the Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, National Public Radio (NPR) examines four major issues that the next president will confront from the outset of their term. One of these issues is the problem of stagnant wages, which has persisted despite the improving economy.\n\nMichael Hall, a 30-year-old elevator operator at Seattle's Space Needle, has witnessed the ups and downs of American paychecks from a unique vantage point. For seven years, he shared in the success of the popular attraction, receiving regular raises due to a union contract. However, when the contract expired, Hall's pay has remained unchanged for the past four years.\n\n\"I could put some money into savings every check. Still go out, grab a beer. But after about two or three years, suddenly it was like there's seven of us in a house. And then finally I started to find myself, about a year ago, living paycheck to paycheck,\" Hall said.\n\nThis story is not unique. Most Americans are not seeing significant wage increases, even as the job market recovers. In April, the official unemployment rate dropped below 5.5 percent for the first time in seven years. However, the issue of stagnant wages dates back much further. Since 1979, average wages have barely kept pace with inflation.\n\nJohn Pallaoro, a self-employed truck driver, recalls that his paychecks stretched further four decades ago. \"I was able to purchase a suburban house in the mid-'70s for the price of barely one year of wages, two years at the most,\" Pallaoro said. \"My standard of living is probably reduced by 50 percent from 40 years ago.\"\n\nStagnant wages are not just a problem for individuals. When workers like Hall and Pallaoro do not have money to spend, it affects the entire economy. Experts point to a variety of causes for wage stagnation, including sluggish productivity growth. In the first decades after World War II, American productivity climbed steadily, nearly 3 percent every year. However, in the mid-'70s, that growth slowed to less than 2 percent.\n\nJames Pethokoukis, an economic policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, suggests that boosting economic growth through reduced taxes and spending could address wage stagnation. \"The default Republican position would be you need to reduce taxes, you need to reduce spending so more of America's economic resources are being run by the private sector,\" he said. \"And that would boost economic growth.\"\n\nOther proposals, such as education reform and increased investment in public works, are also intended to boost productivity. However, there is another challenge: the disconnect between productivity and wages, so even as workers produce more, they do not necessarily see the benefits.\n\nLarry Mishel, president of the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute, notes that \"We have created lots of income, lots of output, lots of wealth over the last three decades, but the problem is it has not accrued to the vast majority.\" Virtually all of the gains have gone to those at the top of the income scale.\n\nPoliticians have sometimes attempted to address this issue through the tax code, taking a slightly larger cut from the wealthy and using tax credits to benefit the poor. However, there are political limits to this approach. Some people consider such government redistribution akin to adding or taking away points after the game has ended. Mishel and others argue that policymakers need to focus more on shaping the rules of the economic game so that average workers can command higher pretax wages.\n\n\"The problems with people's paychecks is not what the federal government is taking out in taxes. It's what employers are not putting in,\" Mishel said.\n\nElevator operator Hall agrees. He notes that while his paycheck has remained stagnant for the past four years, business at the Space Needle has been booming. \"We're busier than we ever were,\" Hall said. \"One full elevator, that pays most of us working for the day. And we'll do that 100 times. It's sort of insulting that they can't afford to keep paying us enough to live in the city.\"\n\nThere is one period in the past 35 years that offers a glimmer of hope for struggling workers: the late 1990s, a time when not only was the economy growing rapidly but the gains were widely shared, so workers on every rung of the economic ladder were climbing together.\n\nEconomist Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities attributes this to \"very full employment,\" with unemployment below 5 percent and, in some months, below 4 percent. This gave workers everywhere leverage to demand higher wages.\n\nShort of full employment, Bernstein suggests that there are other policies that could boost workers' bargaining power, including a higher minimum wage, steps to make it easier for unions to organize, and immigration policies that limit the growth of a shadow workforce.\n\nMany of these policies will be debated over the next year and a half by those seeking to occupy the White House. As the U.S. economic elevator starts to climb again, a central challenge for the next president will be ensuring that more American families are not stuck on the bottom floor.",
    " Title: Federal Indictment Marks Major Step Forward in Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal indictment, as of yet unspecified in terms of the individual or individuals involved, has marked a significant advancement in the ongoing Russia investigation. This development, which is expected to send shockwaves throughout the Trump administration and the nation's capital, follows a year of the Russia investigation casting a shadow over President Trump's political career without substantially altering it.\n\nThe news comes after a week of escalating conservative criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe. Trump-aligned media figures have seized upon a CNN report suggesting that Clinton campaign officials funded the creation of the Steele dossier, an intelligence document detailing Trump's Russian ties, to discredit the overall Russia investigation. It is important to note that the FBI's inquiry predates the dossier, and officials have reportedly stated that it played no role in the intelligence assessment of Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nPresident Trump himself has joined the chorus of criticism, claiming on Twitter that former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should be the focus of scrutiny.\n\nThe indictment signifies a major step forward for the Russia investigation, which was initiated when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Justice Department's investigation on May 17, 2017. This appointment followed a two-week political firestorm for the White House after President Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. Trump initially cited the director's controversial actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation the previous year to justify the dismissal.\n\nHowever, in the days that followed, Trump undermined that narrative on multiple occasions. He told NBC News' Lester Holt that Comey's firing was related to the Russia investigation, and that he would have fired Comey regardless of the Justice Department's recommendations. He also warned the former director on Twitter that Comey should hope there were no tapes of their White House conversations. In response, Comey asked an intermediary to provide reporters with a series of contemporaneous memos the director had drafted after meetings with Trump earlier in the year.\n\nThe memos collectively depicted a president who had little regard for the traditional firewall between the White House's political operations and the Justice Department's criminal investigations. In one instance, Comey wrote that Trump asked him to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn shortly after Flynn's departure as national-security adviser. Trump had fired Flynn, a close but controversial political ally, in February for lying to Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren's Native American Ancestry Claims Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has faced criticism over her claims of Native American ancestry, following the release of a DNA study that suggests a distant Native American ancestor in her family tree. The study, conducted by Professor Carlos Bustamante of Stanford University, indicates that Warren's Native American ancestry is \"in the range of 6\u201310 generations ago,\" which would make Warren between 1/64th Native American and 1/1024th Native American.\n\nWarren, who has previously identified as Native American in legal directories and in her professional career, has faced backlash for her claims, particularly from President Trump, who has often referred to her as \"Pocahontas.\" In response, Warren released the results of the DNA study this week, hoping to quell the controversy. However, the release of the study has instead sparked further criticism, with some arguing that the results do not substantiate her claims.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation released a statement this week, criticizing Warren for her claims of Native American group membership. The statement read, \"Senator Elizabeth Warren is undermining tribal sovereignty with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\"\n\nThe question remains as to why Warren chose to claim Native American ancestry. While the Boston Globe reported six weeks ago that Warren's Native American status was not a factor in her hiring at Harvard Law School, Warren has benefited from her claims of minority status in academia and politics.\n\nIn academia, Warren's Native American status was listed in the University of Pennsylvania's Minority Equity Report and in Harvard Law's annual affirmative-action report, where she was listed as Native American from 1995 to 2004. In politics, claiming minority status adds luster to a resume, particularly in the left-leaning political climate.\n\nWarren has argued that she claimed Native American ancestry because she believed the stories she was told by her female relatives, and that those claims may have turned out to be false but had no impact on her career development. However, by claiming minority status, Warren has positioned herself as part of a coalition of historically disadvantaged minorities, rather than as a white woman in a predominantly white political landscape.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Warren's claims of Native American ancestry highlights the complex and contentious nature of identity politics in contemporary American politics. Critics argue that Warren's claims are an example of radical dishonesty in the pursuit of political gain, while supporters argue that Warren is simply claiming a heritage that she believes to be true, regardless of its veracity. The saga of Elizabeth Warren demonstrates the power and potential pitfalls of identity politics in shaping political narratives and career trajectories.",
    " Title: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Takes Responsibility for Obamacare Website Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has admitted that she is accountable for the problems with the Obamacare rollout, which she described as a \"debacle.\" In a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, Sebelius apologized for the botched launch of HealthCare.gov and pledged to fix the issues and regain the public's trust.\n\nDespite the apology, HealthCare.gov experienced problems on Wednesday morning, creating a split-screen moment on cable TV that showed the website's \"system down\" message and Sebelius under fire. The hearing marked a significant moment in the public's perception of the first month of the Obamacare rollout.\n\nSebelius acknowledged that the law's messy rollout has hurt the administration's credibility, but assured the public that the Obamacare website should be functioning smoothly for most users by November 30. However, she noted that no confidence in that date will be established until the issues are resolved.\n\nSebelius also revealed that she will not release signup numbers until mid-November and will not allow contractors to speak about them until she is certain the information is confirmed and reliable. She admitted that insurers are not receiving accurate and complete data about their new customers due to the system's malfunctions.\n\nRepublican lawmakers criticized Sebelius during the hearing, with some calling for her resignation. However, no one demanded that she quit during the three-and-a-half-hour hearing. Only Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) requested that Sebelius call for the resignation of Gary Cohen, the administration official heading the federal exchange office within HHS. Sebelius declined.\n\nDespite the criticism, Sebelius has become the face of the Obamacare website mess, and she did not receive the same polite treatment that Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, received during a separate hearing on Tuesday. HealthCare.gov experienced problems on Wednesday due to an outage at a data center hosted by Verizon Terremark, just days after a similar outage took down the system on Sunday night. HealthCare.gov is the main portal for coverage in the 36 states that are not running their own health insurance exchanges, and the system also provides key information to the state-run exchanges.",
    " Title: Manchin Pursues Bipartisan Gun Control Measures, Aims to Win Over NRA-Backed Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association (NRA), is reportedly President Barack Obama's best hope for a bipartisan gun control package this year. Manchin, along with Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), has been attempting to broker a compromise with Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), but their efforts have hit roadblocks.\n\nManchin has urged Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to keep an open mind, but to no avail. He has also tried to persuade Senator Dean Heller (R-Nev.) to consider signing on as a prime sponsor, but was quickly rebuffed. Manchin's efforts are growing ever more critical as the battle over gun control hits the Senate floor as soon as next month.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved a sweeping assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA, as well as a prohibition on high-capacity ammunition magazines. However, these proposals stand little chance of becoming law.\n\nManchin is leading a bipartisan group crafting legislation to expand background checks on purchasers of firearms. The group is trying to lure at least one pro-NRA Republican in hopes that will open the floodgates for more support. Support from the GOP will help determine how much backing the effort gets from red-state Democrats, who so far have been lukewarm.\n\nManchin has floated an idea to pro-NRA Senator Mark Begich to combine the Alaska Democrat's bipartisan proposal modifying gun restrictions for the mentally ill with a new background check plan in an attempt to piece together a broader coalition.\n\nSenator Begich's response was that Manchin needs to win over more Republican senators than just moderate Illinois Senator Mark Kirk. \"I know he would like to get a criminal background check completed,\" Begich said of Manchin. \"His challenge is, and I wait for him to finish off his discussions, he needs to bring one or two A-rated NRA Republicans on board. With all due respect to Sen. Kirk, he's an F-rated. You need an A-rated.\"\n\nThe effort to more broadly expand background checks could be the most significant gun control measure to pass a bitterly divided Senate\u2014if a bipartisan deal can first be reached. The central sticking point is whether records of gun sales or purchases must be retained by retailers.\n\nManchin, who calls himself an \"eternal optimist,\" is working furiously to win over Republicans and believes he's making steady progress before he officially proposes a new bill, either with a small group of senators or with a bipartisan coalition. When a bill finally is unveiled and it hits the floor, Manchin is confident pro-gun senators will vote for it\u2014even if they decline to sign on for the moment.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Race Officially Declared Over, Doug Jones Wins Close Contest Against Roy Moore\n\nArticle:\n\nAlabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan announced late Tuesday that the state's Senate race has concluded, with Democrat Doug Jones defeating GOP candidate Roy Moore. In a statement, Lathan expressed the party's disappointment over the close race but emphasized respect for the democratic process.\n\nLathan noted that Jones, during his campaign, repeatedly discussed reaching across the aisle to work with Republicans. She stated, \"While these issues weren\u2019t discussed, and no other Democratic Senator has worked with the Republicans, all eyes will be on his votes.\"\n\nLathan also mentioned that Alabamians are conservative and have no intentions of moving toward the policies of the Democrat Party. She added, \"If Mr. Jones aligns himself with the liberal Democrats in Washington, Alabama voters will remember his choices in the 2020 U.S. Senate election.\"\n\nRoy Moore, in a speech on Tuesday night, refused to concede the special election, stating, \"When the vote is this close, it is not over.\" Alabama state law requires an automatic recount when election results are within 0.5 percentage points. With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Jones holds 49.9 percent of the vote, compared to Moore's 48.4 percent, a 1.5-point gap, according to The New York Times.\n\nJones delivered an exuberant speech in Birmingham, where he emphasized the importance of finding common ground and unity. Jones is the first member of his party to win a Senate seat in the state since 1992.",
    " Title: Uncertainty Over Sequester Cuts Threatens Hiring in Fall\n\nArticle:\n\nLawmakers are expected to take their time deciding how to replace the sequester of automatic cuts scheduled for next year, which has caused uncertainty and could potentially lead to hiring slowdowns and possible layoffs, according to experts and businesses. The so-called sequester, which involves heavy-handed automatic spending cuts set to take effect next year, would total about $110 billion. Half the cuts would come from defense and the other half from non-defense spending on domestic programs.\n\nMost do not expect lawmakers will reach a decision until the lame-duck session of Congress after Election Day, and possibly not until early 2013. The problem is that prolonging the uncertainty is likely to cause serious hiring slowdowns and possible layoffs, experts and businesses said.\n\nBusinesses and agencies need to plan for the year ahead, but they simply cannot because they do not know how many contracts will be funded and how many programs they'll need to cut back on. The point is not lost on Democrat Carl Levin, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"[T]hat uncertainty which is created by... the specter of sequestration... is a real threat to this economy. So not only must we avoid sequestration... we must do it in time to avoid a severe weakening to this economy,\" he said at a National Press luncheon.\n\nThose in the defense industry say the sequester is already having a chilling effect. \"In the past we'd add head count [in summer] to prepare for new work. This year, we'll clearly take a more conservative approach until we see what's going to shake out,\" said Samuel Strickland, CFO of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH, Fortune 500) during a recent investor call.\n\nAt Lockheed Martin (LMT, Fortune 500), the largest U.S. defense contractor, the story is similar. \"We are already taking action by not hiring and training new workers, not investing in new plants and equipment and not investing in new R&D,\" said company chairman and CEO Robert Stevens during a Senate caucus lunch in March.\n\nHowever, Stevens also warned that if he does not get clarity soon, he may be forced to issue notice this fall of possible layoffs in 2013. The federal WARN Act requires businesses with more than 100 employees to notify workers at least 60 days in advance of a mass layoff or plant closing.\n\nSince the sequester takes effect Jan. 2, 2013, the WARN Act requirement could mean layoff notices come out a few days before the Nov. 6 election. But layoff notices are likely to be a measure of last resort for both federal agencies and private sector contractors, said government contracts expert Dan Gordon, who used to run the White House Office of Procurement.\n\nInstead, he said he is expecting \"a dramatic slowdown in hiring\" this fall. \"It's very slow and expensive to cut back on the government's commitment under an existing contract. For both [federal agencies and private contractors], it's always easier to stop hiring than to lay off existing employees,\" Gordon noted.\n\nHe also expects federal agencies over the next seven months to be very reluctant to enter into new commitments with contractors, even though government has become more heavily reliant on contractors to do everything from guarding office buildings to running IT departments.\n\n\"Why make a commitment that might end up being costly to you?\" said Joseph Minarik, senior vice president of the Committee for Economic Development.\n\nLike Gordon, he believes hiring freezes are the greatest risk on the jobs front this fall. But more than anything, Minarik said, for everyone in the public and the private sector, \"all the time being spent on planning for this situation is pure economic waste.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Establishment Rallies Behind Biden Amid Sanders Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Democratic Party establishment has rallied behind Joe Biden following his victories in several states during Super Tuesday. At the time of writing, Biden was projected to have won Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Alabama, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Arkansas, Texas, and Tennessee, with close races in Maine.\n\nThe surge in support for Biden, who was previously struggling in the polls, can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the endorsement of House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn in South Carolina and the withdrawal of several Democratic candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O'Rourke.\n\nThe establishment's support for Biden is primarily driven by concerns about electability and party unity. The argument is that Biden, who is not Bernie Sanders, is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nHowever, the sudden rally around Biden was not due to a belief that he has the best policies or the best temperament to face Trump. Instead, the establishment's support is a reaction to the momentum Sanders had gained after winning the popular vote in each of the first three primary states.\n\nThe primary race is now expected to be a grueling contest that will likely extend until the convention, with Sanders also performing well in several states, including Utah, Colorado, Vermont, and California.\n\nWhile the electability argument is the only one with a semblance of plausibility, it is not the case that Biden is a sure thing, while Sanders is a risky gamble. Sanders, who would be the most left-wing president in history, has consistently polled well against Trump and has a strong fundraising machine and dedicated activist base.\n\nOn the other hand, Biden has several risks, including a history of being creepy with women, cognitive decline, a poor campaign performance, and a record that is at odds with the modern Democratic Party's branding.\n\nNominating Biden could potentially lead to a deflated activist energy and a lower voter turnout among younger voters, who are a significant portion of Sanders' support base.\n\nIn conclusion, the Democratic establishment's support for Biden is a gamble, and the outcome of the primary race remains uncertain. Democratic voters are advised to carefully consider their choices and not be swayed solely by the establishment's fear of a Trump re-election.",
    " Title: Trump's Criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman and the Dual Mandate of the Federal Reserve\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, questioning whether Powell or Chinese President Xi Jinping is America's \"bigger enemy.\" Trump has also accused Powell of being \"clueless\" and has called for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates significantly.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's primary role, as set by the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, is to maintain price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The first part of this mandate involves controlling the money supply to prevent inflation and create financial stability. However, research suggests that the Federal Reserve has struggled to achieve this goal, with its failures contributing to several severe banking crises throughout U.S. history, including those in the 1920s, 1930s, 1980s, and 2000s.\n\nThe goal of maintaining employment is also questionable, as it reflects the belief that the government should create, control, and maximize the number of jobs. The Federal Reserve has historically relied on the now academically debunked idea of a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment, known as the \"Phillips curve.\" However, the Fed's own experience contradicts this notion.\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed's balance sheet has grown from $1 trillion to $4 trillion as it pursued policies of quantitative easing and super-low interest rates. At the same time, it pursued \"tightened\" money by effectively paying banks not to lend. The result of these contradictory policies was to prolong the recession.\n\nQuantitative easing can lead to higher inflation, making the lives of retirees and others who live on fixed incomes more difficult by reducing their spending power. While there has been very little inflation this time around, the Fed has undershot its 2% target. The policies have also reduced the return seniors earn from their savings, encouraged higher risk-taking, discouraged saving and investment, and slowed the growth of labor productivity and real output after the recession.\n\nThe second part of the dual mandate also encourages presidents to think that the Fed's job is to bail them out when the economy is taking a hit, such as due to destructive trade policies. The politicization of the Fed has led it to pursue policies that go against the objective of price stabilization and financial stability.\n\nMilton Friedman once said, \"Money is much too serious a matter to be left to the central bankers.\" Given the existence of the Federal Reserve, it is crucial to ensure that it is not being swayed by political interests.",
    " Title: President Trump Expresses Satisfaction with Removal of FBI Officials Involved in Trump-Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed his satisfaction with the removal of FBI officials who were involved in the Trump-Russia investigation, referring to it as one of his \"greatest achievements\" in office.\n\nDuring a press briefing at Mar-a-Lago, where he is currently on Christmas vacation, Trump stated, \"These were dirty people. These were bad people. These were evil people, and I hope that someday I'm going to consider it my greatest, or one of my greatest achievements, getting rid of them.\"\n\nThe president's comments came in response to a question about a potential pardon for Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who was indicted in the special counsel's investigation on charges of making false statements to Congress. Stone, who worked briefly on the Trump campaign and has known Trump for decades, was convicted on November 15.\n\nTrump stated that he has not yet considered a pardon for Stone, but believes he was treated \"very unfair\" in the special counsel's case. \"I haven't thought of it. I think it's very tough what they did to Roger Stone, compared to what they do to other people on their side,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president also reiterated his belief that his campaign was spied on, stating, \"Now they're finding out it was a big hoax. They're finding out it was a horrible thing. We were spied on, my campaign was spied on.\"\n\nTrump did not specifically identify whom at the FBI he is glad to have ousted. Former FBI Director James Comey was fired on May 9, 2017. Andrew McCabe, who served as FBI deputy director, was fired on March 16, 2018, after the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility and the Justice Department's inspector general found that he lacked candor during interviews about the authorization of media leaks in October 2016.\n\nPeter Strzok, the former deputy chief of counterintelligence, was fired on August 10, 2018, over anti-Trump text messages he exchanged with FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Page resigned from the bureau on May 4, 2018.\n\nStrzok was the lead investigator on Crossfire Hurricane, the counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign. Comey and McCabe were also directly involved in the investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general found that the FBI made \"significant inaccuracies\" in applications for surveillance warrants against Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The FBI relied heavily on the Steele dossier to obtain the warrants, even though investigators had evidence that undermined dossier author Christopher Steele's credibility.",
    " Title: Married Women's Voting Preferences in 2020: A Potential Shift Away from Traditional Trends\n\nArticle:\n\nChristine Garcia, a 37-year-old stay-at-home mother, identifies as a fiscal conservative but social liberal and does not consider herself a particularly political person. However, she expresses strong opinions about President Trump.\n\n\"Maybe on the business side... the money is better as far as I understand,\" Garcia said. \"But a lot of the other things are very worrisome,\" she added, laughing, as she pushed her daughter on a swing in a park in Birmingham, Mich., an affluent suburb of Detroit.\n\nGarcia declined to disclose whom she voted for in 2016, but she finds Trump un-presidential and stated that she would not vote for him in 2020. \"I tell you, I don't like him as a person,\" she said. \"I don't have a good feeling when he comes on and when I see him.\"\n\nFor decades, research has suggested that married women, like Garcia, tend to be more conservative than unmarried women, in part due to social networks, spousal influence, and economics. Election results have confirmed this academic research.\n\nHowever, recent interviews and polling suggest the traditional marriage gap might shrink this November. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster with Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, stated that married women, especially in the last six months, have turned against Trump and are starting to lean towards voting more Democratic in the congressional races, which is a significant change.\n\nGreenberg's most recent polling shows that 57 percent of married women disapprove of President Trump's job performance. This number has increased significantly in the last year and a half. In March 2017, the president's disapproval rating was at 40 percent among married women, according to Greenberg.\n\n\"I think there's some real partisan realignment here,\" said Greenberg. But the question remains: is the possible shift in the marriage gap a side effect of President Trump's administration or a permanent realignment?\n\nBirmingham is located in Michigan's 11th Congressional District, where two women, both in their 30s, are vying for an open seat in Congress. It's a tight race between Republican Lena Epstein, 37, the co-chair of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign in Michigan, and Democrat Haley Stevens, 35, who worked on the Obama administration's auto bailout. The two women are ideologically poles apart.\n\nRepublican women, married or single, consistently tout the health of the economy. Deb O'Hagan, 60, during lunch at a country club where the Bloomfield Republican Women's Club was meeting, stated, \"Oh my gosh, it took off the day after the election. People knew what his policies were going to be, they knew what his goals were going to be.\"\n\nEsther Littmann, a 78-year-old Republican mother of three grown children, has noticed younger women have a different view of the economy. \"A lot of younger women, they haven't experienced life enough,\" she said. \"I feel like right now a lot of younger women who are in favor of socialism don't really understand the economy, don't understand what they've grown up with, the advantages that they've had.\"\n\nFewer than 50 percent of American women are married, according to data from the Census Bureau. Single women tend to be younger, more racially diverse, and less educated. The voting gap among women is not entirely about all those single ladies. It's also tied to age. Young women, like 25-year-old Bridget O'Connor, regardless of whether they're married, tend to be Democrats.\n\nO'Connor, on a lunch break from her marketing job, says she does not know who's running for Congress in her district, but she plans to vote this November, and her main priority is to get the president out of office.\n\nAround Michigan's 11th Congressional District, NPR met many married women who say they were never engaged in Democratic Party politics, but now they're knocking on doors and volunteering for candidates.\n\n\"2016 was the time I said, 'I don't know if I can ever vote for a Republican again,'\" said Louri Jouppi. Jouppi states that voting Democratic probably costs her more money, given her husband's income, but she's willing to pay more taxes if it means she is not sacrificing her moral values. Her friend Sonia Patel agreed.\n\n\"I'll pay taxes if it means the children can be with their parents,\" said Patel, referring to the Trump administration's immigration policies. Patel, a stay-at-home mom from Canton, Mich., says she used to vote for a mix of Democrats and Republicans. For instance, she voted for Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder. But after the 2016 election, she joined the board of the local Canton Democratic Club, saying motherhood and age have turned her from a moderate into a Democrat.\n\n\"My kids started growing up. I started looking at the world differently. I think it wasn't just about me anymore, and I started thinking about the world I'm leaving them,\" said Patel.",
    " Title: Partisan Divide in U.S. Electorate Widens Ahead of Election Day\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming U.S. presidential election will find the winner leading a deeply divided American electorate, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center. The two major political parties are drifting apart, with significant differences in race, religion, and other demographic measures, the study suggests.\n\nThe Pew report, titled \"Election 2016,\" indicates that the ongoing demographic changes in the country have reshaped both party coalitions. The divide between the parties is expected to widen in the coming years.\n\nThe Republican Party is becoming whiter, older, and more religious than the general population, while the Democratic Party is becoming more diverse, younger, and less religious at a faster rate than the U.S. population.\n\nIn terms of race, the parties are not becoming monolithically white or non-white. Instead, the racial makeup of the two parties is becoming increasingly dissimilar, as racial minorities disproportionately favor Democrats. In 2008, whites made up 88% of all Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, according to Pew's data. By 2016, this had dropped to 86%. On the other hand, whites made up 64% of Democrats and Democratic-leaners in 2008, and they are now 57%, a seven-percent drop over the period of Obama's two terms.\n\nThe divide is also evident in age, with Republicans becoming relatively older, education, with college-educated voters declining as a percentage of the GOP and increasing as a percentage of the Democratic vote, and religion. Fully 29% of the Democratic coalition now identifies as atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular, compared to 12% for the GOP.\n\n\"Democrats are becoming the party of minorities and college-educated whites, while Republicans are becoming the party of whites with lower levels of education,\" writes William Galston of the Brookings Institution in a study of the problems facing the next administration.\n\nThese groups are not just divided by inflammatory, nonsubstantive wedge issues. They have real differences of outlook and interest, Galston notes. Minorities are more likely to support affirmative action, college-educated voters are more likely to support increased federal aid for education, and religious voters are more likely to oppose abortion.\n\nOverall, the Democratic coalition is more comfortable with diversity, believes that the present is better than the past, and looks forward to the future with optimism. The Republican coalition sees increasing diversity as a threat, prefers past decades over today, and looks ahead with foreboding.\n\nGalston suggests that the winner of the 2016 presidential election will find it challenging to narrow this divide unless they focus on an agenda of national reconciliation starting on Day 1 of the transition.",
    " Title: Former CIA Director Petraeus Warns Iran of Escalating Tensions with U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer CIA Director David Petraeus has issued a warning to Iran, stating that the Middle Eastern nation must exercise caution as tensions between Iran and the United States escalate. In an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Petraeus stated, \"They are going to have to make a decision. Either they are going to have to really tighten their belt and keep tightening, because it's going to get worse.\"\n\nPetraeus further explained, \"There are going to be further screws tightening down in the maximum pressure campaign and try to grit their teeth and get to November 2020 in hopes that their desired outcome emerges.\" He added, \"They're going to have to be very careful not to overplay their hand and result in some kind of response that is quite punitive.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's recent actions, including the deployment of an aircraft carrier and other military resources to the Persian Gulf region, and the withdrawal of nonessential personnel from Iraq, have raised concerns among some lawmakers about the possibility of a confrontation with Iran.\n\nPresident Trump has downplayed any potential for conflict, but questions remain about the reasons behind these actions, and many lawmakers have demanded more information. The tension between Tehran and Washington is largely due to reports of bombings and attacks across the region that have been linked to Iranian-backed terror groups, as well as the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear accord with Iran over a year ago.\n\nTrump pulled out of the agreement, which he has criticized as \"the worst deal in history.\" He argued that the accord should have restrained Iran's ballistic missile program and curbed what his administration considers Tehran's hostile activities in the region. The administration reimposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the agreement.\n\nIn response, Iran has threatened to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its 2015 nuclear deal. Iran has also stopped its sale of excess uranium and heavy water, as required under the deal.",
    " Title: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Delivers Keynote Address at New Hampshire Republican Fundraiser, Renewing Speculation for 2016 Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal will deliver the keynote address at a Republican fundraiser in New Hampshire on Friday, an appearance that has renewed speculation about a potential 2016 presidential bid. The event, hosted by the Republican State Senate Political Action Committee, is taking place in Manchester, with ticket prices ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.\n\nSteven Duprey, a member of the Republican National Committee from New Hampshire, commented on the significance of the Granite State, which hosts the first primary in the nation. He stated that the state is an ideal location for candidates to begin laying the groundwork for a presidential run, particularly for those who may not have as much financial backing or national recognition.\n\n\"For candidates who might not have as much money as some others, or who aren't yet nationally known, this is a great time to come to New Hampshire to start to introduce themselves and to listen to what New Hampshire voters are concerned about,\" Mr. Duprey said. \"Anyone who thinks the Republican rules only favor the better known and better funded candidates should not complain. Instead they should come to New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada. There are lots of low fares to each of those states.\"\n\nMr. Duprey served as the campaign manager for Sen. John McCain during the Arizona Republican's bid for the White House in 2008. After finishing fourth in the Iowa caucus, which initiates the nomination contests, Mr. McCain went on to win the New Hampshire primary, a victory that contributed to his eventual Republican nomination. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney also won the New Hampshire primary last year on his way to winning the Republican nomination.\n\nPresident Obama, however, won the state in the 2008 and 2012 general elections.\n\nThe University of Virginia's Center for Politics this week handicapped the field of potential 2016 candidates, and placed Mr. Jindal, an Indian-American, in the second tier of candidates for the GOP nomination. The Center for Politics identified Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as the frontrunners, with Mr. Jindal and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky considered to be close behind.\n\nMr. Duprey suggested that the key to performing well in New Hampshire is not to give speeches, but to hold town halls that provide candidates with a more intimate setting to interact with voters. \"John McCain set the standard. Follow his playbook,\" he said.",
    " Title: Alabama Chief Justice Suspended for Ordering Prohibition of Gay Marriage Licenses\n\nArticle:\n\nAlabama's Supreme Court Chief Justice, Roy Moore, was suspended on Friday due to potential removal from office for issuing an order in January that prohibited state probate judges from granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission has charged Moore with violating the state's judicial ethics laws, according to news website AL.com.\n\nThe legality of gay marriage was a contentious issue for years until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, marking a historic victory for the American gay rights movement. Despite the ruling and a federal court ruling that made gay marriage legal in Alabama, Moore's administrative order instructed state probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to court documents.\n\nThe complaint states that Moore \"flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority\" and knowingly ordered probate judges to commit potential violations, subjecting them to potential prosecution and removal from office. Moore contends that the commission has no authority over administrative orders or the court's ability to prohibit probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nIn his order, Moore argued that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was at odds with a decision in March 2015 by the Alabama Supreme Court that instructed probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The conflicting opinions resulted in \"confusion and uncertainty,\" Moore said, with many probate judges issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while others refused to do so. Until the Alabama Supreme Court decides the matter, probate judges \"have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license,\" he said.\n\nThe complaint asserts that Moore's order was \"contrary to clear and determined law about which there is no confusion or unsettled question.\"\n\nMoore, a Republican, has been a prominent figure in conservative causes. In 2003, he was removed from office after a federal judge ruled he was placing himself above the law by refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument. He regained the chief justice job in 2012, vowing not to do anything to create further friction with the federal courts.",
    " Title: U.S. Investigators Sought Warrants for Michael Cohen's Emails in July 2017, Nine Months Before FBI Raids\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. investigators, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office, sought warrants to access Michael Cohen's emails in July 2017, nine months before the FBI raided the home and office of President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer. The nearly 900 pages of documents released by a federal judge in New York provide more detailed accounts of Cohen's financial relationships than previously known.\n\nThe requests for emails were made six months into Trump's presidency, with the emails sought dating back as far as June 2015. Mueller is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination with Trump campaign members.\n\nCohen had been Trump's personal lawyer and self-described fixer for more than a decade, but began cooperating with federal investigators soon after the April 2018 raids on his home, office, and hotel room. He later pleaded guilty in separate prosecutions to lying to Congress, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations, including paying hush money to silence two women who claimed they had sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nCohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison term on May 6. Trump has denied having had sexual relationships with the two women: Stormy Daniels, the porn actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nMuch of the discussion about campaign finance issues in the released documents was redacted. They were released after U.S. District Judge William Pauley on Monday ordered prosecutors to make redacted versions public, in response to requests by news media organizations.\n\nLanny Davis, a lawyer for Cohen, said in a statement on Monday night that the document release \"only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress.\"\n\nSince pleading guilty, Cohen has publicly turned on Trump, telling the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Feb. 27 that his former boss was a \"racist,\" \"con man,\" and \"cheat.\" In his congressional testimony, Cohen said he was \"ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty, of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him.\"\n\nCohen began working for Trump in 2007. The Republican president in December called his former lawyer \"a rat\" and in January said Cohen was \"lying to reduce his jail time.\"\n\nMoscow has denied meddling in the 2016 election, though U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that it interfered to help Trump win. Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia, and described the Mueller probe as a political witch hunt.\n\nThe newly released documents showed how the FBI made extensive use of its access to Cohen's Apple iCloud account, which allowed him to coordinate his work across such devices as an iPhone, iPad Mini, and laptop. FBI agents said they located a hotel room in New York's Loews Regency Hotel where Cohen was staying by using a device known as a Triggerfish that mimics cell phone towers to find a specific device.\n\nThe bank fraud case stemmed from Cohen dealings unrelated to Trump, and suggest that his financial situation was dire. According to the documents, Cohen was in default by December 2017 on more than $20 million in loans backed by New York taxicab medallions he owned. The FBI believed Cohen misrepresented his finances to banks he owed money to.\n\nAccording to the documents, Cohen concealed fees being paid to Essential Consultants, a firm he controlled, for political consulting, including from international clients with issues pending before the Trump administration. Among the payments Cohen was believed to have received was $600,000 from AT&T Inc for consulting about \"political issues, including net neutrality, the merger between AT&T and Time Warner and tax reform.\" Another $583,333 came from an investment firm controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg, the documents showed.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have criticized Cohen's consulting work, arguing he should have made his contracts public through disclosures. The warrant does not appear to detail any violations to lobbying disclosure laws.\n\nCohen also used Essential Consultants to pay hush money to Daniels.",
    " Title: Obama Urges Congress to Act on Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Outlines Key Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Tuesday called on Congress to move forward with a comprehensive bill to overhaul the nation's immigration system, stating that \"the time is now\" to address the issue. During a speech in Las Vegas, Nevada, the president outlined key principles he believes should be included in immigration reform, such as a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S.\n\nIn his speech at Del Sol High School, Obama emphasized the need for Congress to act swiftly on a comprehensive approach to dealing with the undocumented immigrants currently in the country. He indicated that if Congress does not act promptly, he will send his own bill to Capitol Hill and insist that they vote on it immediately.\n\nWhile Obama set a deadline for Congress, he expressed optimism about lawmakers' efforts to craft their own proposals. On Monday, a bipartisan group of senators, known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" unveiled their own outline for comprehensive reform. This plan includes a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, increased border security, crackdowns on businesses that employ undocumented immigrants, and the admission of skilled immigrant workers to the United States.\n\nObama praised the Senate framework, stating that it aligns with the principles he has advocated for in the past few years. He expressed hope that there is a genuine desire among lawmakers to get this done soon, but emphasized that action is necessary.\n\nRepublican reactions to Obama's speech were generally cautious. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the Gang of Eight, acknowledged the differences between himself and the president but expressed optimism about finding common ground.\n\nPassage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the House of Representatives could prove challenging. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) did not rule out taking up a bill based on Obama's comments, but expressed a desire for a bipartisan solution and warned against the president dragging the debate to the left.\n\nThe president's address highlighted the similarities between his proposals and the Gang of Eight's, but there are indications that the two may differ in key areas. For example, the senators' plan would allow undocumented immigrants to apply for legal status but not seek permanent legal residence until the border is deemed secure. In his speech, Obama did not specifically link border security to a pathway to citizenship.\n\nObama's principles for a path to citizenship include undergoing a background check, paying fines and back taxes, learning English, and going to the back of the line, meaning they could not obtain citizenship until backlogs of legal immigrants are cleared.\n\nThe White House made it clear before the speech that the president is withholding judgment on the Senate's plan until actual legislative language is drafted. Obama also emphasized the need for the government to stay focused on enforcement and for any immigration reform bill to crack down on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented immigrants with stiffer fines and penalties.\n\nHowever, the president's stance on a path to citizenship did not satisfy all Republicans working on an immigration reform plan. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressed concern about the president's unwillingness to accept significant enforcement triggers before current undocumented immigrants can apply for a green card.\n\nIn addition, the president's speech and fact sheet did not mention a temporary, guest-worker program, a provision that business groups and Republicans have called for in agricultural industries and other companies that rely on low-skilled immigrant labor. Labor unions have been hesitant to support such programs without strong labor protections.\n\nObama has faced criticism from lawmakers in both political parties and Latino groups for not bringing up a comprehensive immigration reform bill during his first term and for his record deportation numbers. However, the president was warmly received by the crowd inside Del Sol High School's gymnasium, who chanted \"s\u00ed se puede!\" during the speech.\n\nImmigration reform is not just a policy debate, Obama said, but a matter of people, emphasizing that the men and women seeking a chance to earn their way into the American story have made the nation stronger throughout history.",
    " Title: Former ICE Director Thomas Homan's Outburst at Congressional Hearing Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThomas Homan, the former acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from January 2017 to June 2018, testified before the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship on Thursday. The hearing focused on ICE detention centers, which have been the subject of numerous human rights abuses allegations.\n\nDuring the hearing, Homan faced criticism for ICE's conduct and policies under his leadership. More than 50,000 immigrants are currently being held in ICE custody, with private, for-profit prisons housing nearly three-fourths of them. Reports issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General in June 2019 and September 2018 found that ICE facilities are filthy, brutal, and dangerous. Immigrants, including children, are routinely denied access to medical care, live in filthy conditions, are given expired and unsafe food, denied hygiene items, and denied recreation and visitation. Detainees are illegally placed in solitary confinement and strip-searched. At one facility, inspectors found nooses in 15 different cells. At least 24 immigrants have died in ICE detention under President Trump.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who chaired the subcommittee on Thursday, is the sponsor of a bill, the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act of 2019, that seeks to address these problems. The measure would heighten standards for ICE facilities, increase inspections, grant more robust rights to detainees, and phase out ICE's use of private prisons. The bill has 130 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives, all Democrats.\n\nWitnesses at the hearing included Selene Saavedra Roman, a Dreamer wrongfully detained by ICE for six weeks; Denis Davydov, a gay HIV-positive immigrant wrongfully detained by ICE while seeking asylum from Russia; and Blanche Engochan, a Cameroon refugee subjected to horrific mistreatment in ICE detention.\n\nHoman's testimony was marked by repeated interruptions and outbursts, including shouting at congressional Democrats and refusing to stop speaking when his time expired. In one instance, Homan refused to stop speaking even after Rep. Jayapal gaveled him down, shouting, \"I'm a taxpayer, you work for me!\"\n\nThis was not Homan's first blowup at the prospect of having to answer to criticism. Earlier this month, Homan engaged in a similar performance, attempting to shout down Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after his time expired. Like Jayapal, Ocasio-Cortez had to gavel him down.\n\nThe incidents demonstrate how ICE operated under Homan's watch. Agents felt free to illegally detain immigrants, then deceive courts to secure their deportation. They treated their targets as legal non-persons, in a crusade to detain and deport as many as possible. ICE has gone after lawful immigrants, too, attempting to revoke their green cards for no good reason. Homan claimed he simply sought to enforce the laws on the books. However, when state legislators began to limit local law enforcement's ability to cooperate with ICE, Homan announced on Fox News that those lawmakers should be charged with crimes.\n\nThe first wave of coverage of Homan's outburst on Thursday came from right-wing media, praising his defiance. It was pure Trumpism, the elevation of culture war over the basic constitutional order. Thomas Homan does not recognize the authority of Pramila Jayapal or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He does not think he has to follow their rules. He does not believe that two women of color have any right to hold power over him. \"You work for me!\" the former government employee screamed at an elected member of the government. He is a man who is used to wielding power against people who look like Jayapal and Ocasio-Cortez. He is the embodiment of ICE under Trump, certain\u2014as so many ICE officers are\u2014that he answers to no one.",
    " Title: Russian President Putin Emerges from 11-Day Absence, Amid Speculation on Health and Public Appearances\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin made a public appearance on Monday in St. Petersburg, marking his first sighting in 11 days. The absence of the 62-year-old leader had sparked a flurry of speculation regarding his health, control of the government, and personal life.\n\nPutin's last public appearance was on March 5, when he was seen with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Over the past week, the Kremlin released undated photo and video footage of Putin, which only fueled the conjecture about his health.\n\nWhen asked about the health rumors, Putin jokingly told reporters in Russia's second city that \"It would be boring without gossip.\" Images published on social media did not indicate any unusual changes in his appearance.\n\nIndependent Russian TV channel Dozhd reported that Putin might have been suffering from the flu and isolating at his residence in the Novgorod region. Meanwhile, Austrian newspaper Kurier suggested he was receiving treatment in Moscow from an Austrian orthopedist for back problems. The Kremlin has not commented on these reports.\n\nAlexei Makarkin, vice president of the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies, stated, \"Discussing the president's health is the same thing as aiding the enemy.\" Makarkin attributed this secrecy to the legacy of the former Soviet Union.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Putin added to the speculation when he ordered an unscheduled inspection of parts of the nation's military but did not show up for the drill. The inspection of Russia's Northern Fleet, which includes 38,000 military personnel and 3,360 pieces of military hardware, was confirmed by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, according to the Interfax news service.\n\nFurther fueling the speculation, a planned visit by Putin to Kazakhstan was rescheduled to March 20. Moscow has expressed concern about an increase in NATO exercises held near the Russian border. One year ago, Russian forces took over the Black Sea Peninsula, annexing the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.",
    " Title: President Trump's UN General Assembly Agenda: Pushing Reforms, Confronting Threats, and Pursuing Economic Deals\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrived at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, marking his first appearance at the international body with a mission to implement his \"America First\" agenda and engage in diplomatic discussions with world leaders. The four-day event in New York will see Trump pushing for reforms to the United Nations, rethinking America's financial contributions, brokering economic deals, and addressing global threats such as North Korea, Iran, and Islamic State.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley stated, \"We can all say it is a new day at the U.N. It's not just about talking. It's about action.\" However, the new direction the president has set for America has left many of the approximately 120 world leaders attending the assembly, who were more comfortable with President Obama, questioning Trump's approach.\n\nIn the eight months since taking office, Trump has demonstrated his willingness to use American military and economic power, with missile strikes on Syria, get-tough trade measures on China, and threats against North Korea. Jon Alterman, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted, \"For a number of leaders, this is going to be their first chance to see him, to judge him, to try to get on his good side.\"\n\nThe grueling schedule of the week-long event will test Trump's skills and endurance, as he is a novice in international diplomacy. The tightly choreographed week also poses a unique challenge to Trump, who has a propensity for going off script and delighting in upsetting convention.\n\nTrump's schedule for the four-day event includes a hotly anticipated speech to the assembled delegations on Tuesday, discussions on reforms to the United Nations on Monday, meetings with leaders of France and Israel, a working dinner at Trump Tower with presidents of Peru, Colombia, and Brazil, and sit-downs with leaders of Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Britain, Egypt, and African leaders, among others.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump will deliver his first address to the assembly, emphasizing the need for states to promote peace and prosperity while upholding sovereignty and accountability as indispensable foundations of international order. The president will also meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, General Assembly President Miroslav Lajcak of Slovakia, and the emir of Qatar.\n\nLater in the week, Trump will have meetings with leaders of Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Britain, Egypt, and Africa, focusing on strengthening security and economic relationships. The final day of the assembly on Thursday will include meetings with leaders of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Ukraine, as well as the leaders of South Korea and Japan, where North Korean nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs will be the main topic.\n\nTrump may also face resistance in his efforts to end or renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal, as administration officials hint that he will likely face resistance at a meeting with foreign ministers of the U.S. partners in the deal: Russia, China, France, Britain, and Germany.\n\nThe North Korea crisis may no longer be in the hands of the Security Council, according to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who stated that the North Korea problem may now be one for the Pentagon to resolve. Trump may also face uncomfortable moments over his sharp criticism of the Iran nuclear deal.",
    " Title: James Comey's Descriptions of President Trump in New Book Draw Criticism for Childish Tone\n\nArticle:\n\nExcerpts from James Comey's new book were released Thursday night, and the former FBI director's descriptions of President Donald Trump have drawn criticism for a perceived childish tone. The book, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" includes details of Comey's interactions with Trump, including his recollections of the president's physical appearance.\n\nIn the book, Comey describes Trump's face as slightly orange with bright white half-moons under his eyes, which he assumes are from tanning goggles, and impressively coifed, bright blond hair. He also notes the size of Trump's hand, stating that it was smaller than his, but not unusually so.\n\nCritics argue that these descriptions, particularly the ones about Trump's appearance, are unnecessary and detract from the serious nature of the book's content. Some have suggested that these comments make Comey look more like a high-school bully than a former FBI director.\n\nThe concern is that these descriptions, particularly those about Trump's appearance, undermine Comey's credibility as a witness and author. For example, the passage where Comey refers to the \"soft white pouches\" under Trump's \"expressionless blue eyes\" precedes a section where he writes that he believed the president did not understand the FBI's role in American life.\n\nThe criticism is that these descriptions, particularly those about Trump's appearance, make Comey look more like a disgruntled former employee rather than an unbiased narrator. Some argue that these descriptions are petty and juvenile, and that they are hack, as they are jokes that have probably been made millions of times before.\n\nIt is unclear why Comey chose to include these descriptions in the book, but some suggest that he may have been trying to get a rise out of Trump, given his previous reactions to similar comments about his hands and skin tone.\n\nIn response to the book's release, President Trump tweeted, \"James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and\u2026..\" (April 13, 2018).\n\nSome argue that, regardless of one's political leanings, it would be beneficial for all parties involved to act more mature and avoid childish attacks and personal jabs.",
    " Title: Third-party Candidates Race Against Time to Qualify for Presidential Debate Stage\n\nArticle:\n\nThird-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are racing against the clock to meet the 15 percent national polling threshold to qualify for the presidential debate stage. The first debate is scheduled for Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, but a decision on qualifying candidates is expected in early September, giving the underfunded and little-known candidates about one month to reach the threshold.\n\nBoth Johnson, the Libertarian Party nominee and former Republican governor of New Mexico, and Stein, the Green Party nominee, have surpassed one hurdle by being included in the polls that will determine the debate participants. However, reaching 15 percent in five national surveys leading up to the debate remains a steep climb.\n\nGOP pollster David Winston noted that this year presents a unique opportunity for third-party candidates, as both major party presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have high disapproval ratings. \"You have two historically unappealing candidates in Clinton and Trump that a majority view unfavorably, so a lot of voters are looking for alternatives,\" Winston said.\n\nJohnson has approached the 15 percent mark in several surveys, reaching as high as 12 percent in a Fox News poll released this week. Johnson's campaign has relied heavily on digital content and media coverage to get their message out, and Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, have participated in two prime-time town hall events on CNN. The first event received fewer than 1 million viewers, while the second, which took place on Wednesday, reached 1.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched cable news program in its time slot.\n\nNow, the campaign is looking beyond the press to more traditional campaign activities. Johnson and Weld will hold their first rallies of the cycle this weekend in Nevada and Utah, with additional rallies in Colorado and New Mexico expected later. The campaign is also set to release a national radio ad soon, and a national TV ad is in the works.\n\nWeld has embraced the role of fundraiser for the campaign, boasting in the CNN town hall about having secured $1 million in commitments in one day. That would nearly match what the campaign had raised in the first half of the year. Campaign manager Ron Nielson said small-dollar fundraising is also picking up, with the ticket raising $500,000 in grassroots donations over a two-day stretch this month.\n\nThe Johnson-Weld campaign has more than 40 paid staffers now and nearly as many full-time volunteers. Nielson is cautiously optimistic about their chances of making the first debate. \"We think we're moving up right now,\" he said. \"We see a lot of support. We feel good. We think we can get above 15 percent.\"\n\nStein has topped out at 6 percent in the polls and is only at 4 percent in the RealClearPolitics average. The liberal Green Party candidate is making a concerted push to attract supporters of former Democratic contender Bernie Sanders. Stein has grabbed headlines for being fiercely critical of Clinton, though in a new television ad running on cable news she savages both major party candidates.\n\nThe third-party candidates suffered a setback on Friday when a district court judge threw out a case they brought against the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) challenging the polling threshold. Johnson still has a separate legal challenge against the commission outstanding. The nonpartisan agency, which declined to comment for this story, could come under pressure as the debates near if Johnson or Stein are climbing in the polls.\n\nNielson, of Johnson's campaign, lashed out at the agency in a statement. \"With Governor Johnson consistently polling in double-digits, we continue to believe that the CPD should make the right and fair decision to invite him to participate in the upcoming debates,\" Nielson said. \"There is clearly an unprecedented desire for alternatives to the Republican and Democratic nominees, and voters deserve an opportunity to see and hear that there are, in fact, other credible, serious choices,\" he continued. \"The CPD could act today to end the two-party stranglehold on the debates, and that is precisely what they should do.\"\n\nPollsters interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 are doubtful either candidate will make the debate stage. \"I think it's unlikely, unless both major party candidates start leaching base support,\" said Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. \"While third-party candidates are set to do better this year than in most cycles, the 15 percent threshold is too high a hurdle.\"\n\nIf they miss on the first round, there will be a vice presidential match-up in October and two more presidential debates that month.",
    " Title: Florida Reports Record-Breaking 15,000 New Coronavirus Cases, Raising Concerns Among Public Health Experts\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida reported over 15,000 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, surpassing the daily record reported by any single state and drawing international attention to a state that has become one of the world's biggest virus hotspots. The Florida Department of Health received 135,992 results from people who have never been tested before, and 15,299 of those tests came back positive for Covid-19. The positivity rate of new infections was 11.25 percent, which is at least a two-week low and down significantly since the state's record high of 18 percent reported on Wednesday.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis' administration has continued its messaging strategy of presenting the numbers in a positive light, an approach that has drawn increasing criticism as Florida has emerged as one of the biggest virus hotspots in the world. On Sunday, DeSantis' communications director, Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, tweeted, \"Florida COVID positive cases decline for a third day in a row to 11.25 % despite a record 142,981 tests results returned in a single day.\" The tweet used a figure that includes those who have been tested multiple times.\n\nDeSantis has routinely turned to the median age of new positive cases to downplay the recent spike, as younger people often show fewer symptoms and rarely require hospitalization. However, public health experts note that the spread in younger populations increases the likelihood of people in at-risk populations, like seniors, getting sick. Young \"survivors are reporting significant remaining health issues (fatigue, inability to return to normal levels of exercise) and significant financial burden (loss of work, medical costs),\" Jill Roberts of the University of South Florida College of Public Health told a news outlet last week.\n\nOn Friday, the DeSantis administration released current hospitalization numbers, which showed 6,974 patients hospitalized with coronavirus as their primary diagnosis, a number that jumped to 7,507 on Sunday. For months, the administration refused to disclose the information, but relented after continued pressure by the Miami Herald and other media outlets.\n\nThe issue of reopening Florida's schools has become the newest politicized coronavirus battlefield. Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, a DeSantis appointee and former Republican speaker of the Florida House, issued an order last week telling school districts they must open classrooms for five days a week beginning next month. Corcoran must approve a district's reopening plan before they can get their cut of state funding. The demand to reopen the state's schools coincided almost to the day with President Donald Trump's beginning a forceful push to get the nation's schools back open, an effort the administration is making as Trump's poll numbers slump less than four months ahead of Election Day.",
    " Title: Romney Delivers Scathing Speech Against Trump, Calls Him a \"Phony\" and a \"Fraud\"\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, launched a critical attack against Donald Trump, the current GOP front-runner, on Thursday, labeling him as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" In a speech at the University of Utah, Romney warned that a Trump presidency would lead to recession and \"make America and the world less safe.\"\n\nRomney, who lost to President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, criticized Trump's business record, mocking some of his lesser-known ventures like Trump Mortgage. He also claimed that if Trump were to be nominated, it would enable Hillary Clinton to be elected president.\n\nTrump responded to Romney's criticism on Twitter, claiming he is the \"only one who can beat Hillary Clinton\" and recalling Romney's record in the presidential elections. Trump also did not rule out mounting an independent bid.\n\nRomney's speech came ahead of the Republican primary debate Thursday night in Detroit, the candidates' first showdown since Super Tuesday. The address amounted to an unprecedented full-court press by Romney to stop Trump from winning the party's nomination.\n\nRomney's speech was not the first time he has criticized Trump. Last week, he told Fox News' Neil Cavuto that he believes there may be a \"bombshell\" in Trump's tax returns and called for Trump to release his returns as soon as possible. He also criticized Trump for not immediately disavowing the support of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke.\n\nAlthough Romney has not endorsed a candidate in the race, there has been widespread media speculation that he could be tempted back into the race in the case of a contested Republican convention as a last-ditch effort to derail Trump. The speech comes after Trump racked up a string of Super Tuesday wins, building a wide, though not insurmountable, delegate lead over his closest rivals, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.",
    " Title: Ryan's Email Campaign Sparks Speculation Among Republican Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nHollywood, Fla. \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan has been sending a series of emails to select Republican leaders, causing some recipients to question the intentions behind the messages. Some recipients view the emails as self-advertisements, while others interpret them as campaign materials for a potential presidential run if neither Ted Cruz nor Donald Trump secure the nomination after multiple ballots.\n\nRyan, who has previously stated he has no interest in running for president, has been in the role of Speaker since October, following the vacancy created by Rep. John Boehner of Ohio. One email states, \"no matter the outcome of this year\u2019s crucial presidential election, your Republican House majority will continue to fight for conservative values.\"\n\nThe email also includes a \"Leadership Priority Survey\" to collect input and guide the party's agenda for the election year. A prominent RNC member, who received multiple emails from Ryan in the past week, expressed confusion and asked, \"What do you think is up?\"\n\nA state GOP chairman attending the Republican National Committee's annual spring meeting in Florida, who also requested anonymity, believed the emails were self-advertisements for Ryan. The speaker has faced criticism from conservatives for his promises to rein in President Obama's liberal policies after the Republican Party gained control of both the Senate and the House.\n\nThe Ryan email campaign is relevant to the RNC meeting, as members will debate on Thursday whether to adopt rules for the party's national presidential nominating convention that would make it more difficult to nominate a \"white knight\" to take the nomination from Cruz or Trump.",
    " Title: Koch Brothers Launch Multi-Million Dollar Campaign Against Trump's Trade Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nBillionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, co-owners of Koch Industries, one of the world's largest privately-owned firms, are funding a multi-million dollar campaign against President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Three political groups backed by the brothers, including Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Americans for Prosperity, and the LIBRE Initiative, are urging the president to lift the recent tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, as well as proposed tariffs on other imports from China.\n\nThe campaign, which will utilize advertising, lobbying, and grassroots campaigns, aims to highlight the benefits of free trade. The move comes after Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nOn Tuesday, David Koch, 78, stepped down from Koch Industries due to health reasons. In a letter, Charles Koch, 82, expressed his sadness about his brother's departure, stating, \"David has always been a fighter and is dealing with this challenge in the same way.\"\n\nThe Koch-backed groups are urging the president to reconsider his tariff policies, citing potential negative impacts on American consumers and businesses. Americans for Prosperity president Tim Phillips said the tariffs would \"hamstring our full economic potential.\"\n\n\"There are better ways to negotiate trade deals than by punishing American consumers and businesses with higher costs,\" Phillips added.\n\nThe campaign signals growing concern among business groups, typically Republican supporters, about the impact of the tariffs. Leaders from the EU, Canada, and Mexico have criticized the move and threatened retaliation, sparking fears of a trade war. On Tuesday, Mexico imposed a wide range of new tariffs on US goods, including steel, pork, and bourbon.\n\nTrump has defended the steel tariffs, stating they will protect US steelmakers, which he considers vital to national security. However, the Koch network of political organizations, a reliable cash machine for Republicans for more than a decade, is now expressing opposition to the president's tariff policies.\n\nSince Trump's surprise victory, Charles and David Koch have sought common ground with the president, particularly on tax reform. However, they continue to be far from ideological soul mates, and their relationship is becoming increasingly strained as the president pushes for protectionist trade policies.\n\nThe Koch brothers' company, the second-largest privately-owned business in the US, has interests ranging from pipelines to paper towels. According to Forbes Magazine, each of the men is worth about $60 billion (\u00a345 billion), and they are tied for eighth richest man in the US. According to the Koch Industries website, they have more than 120,000 employees between all their businesses and subsidiaries.\n\nThe brothers have previously put money into groups denying climate change and attacking unions and workers' rights. However, they have also pushed for criminal justice reform and made large donations to the American Civil Liberties Union. Last November, the brothers helped fund Meredith Corporation's deal to buy US magazine publisher Time Inc.\n\nTo many Americans, they are known more for their political activism than their corporate brands. The brothers are political mega-donors who have spent millions of dollars on supporting conservative policies, particularly causes that seek to roll back regulations. In 1980, David Koch ran as a vice-presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party.",
    " Title: CBO Estimates $10.2 Billion in Earned Income and Additional Child Tax Credits Cost Over a Decade Due to President Obama's Executive Amnesty\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that President Obama's unilateral executive amnesty will cost taxpayers $10.2 billion in Earned Income and Additional Child tax credits over the next ten years. In a letter to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS), CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf outlined the financial implications of the House of Representatives Department of Homeland Security funding bill, which aims to undo both of Obama's executive amnesty programs: the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program and the 2014 Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program.\n\nThe letter states that the House of Representatives Department of Homeland Security funding bill would decrease on-budget deficits by $8.8 billion over ten years due to billions in tax credit spending cuts. The earned income tax credit and the child tax credit are refundable tax credits, according to the letter, which reduce a taxpayer's overall income tax liability. If the credits exceed the other liability, the excess may be refunded to the taxpayer, and these refunds are classified as outlays in the federal budget.\n\nThe CBO letter further explains that the decrease in outlays for refundable credits projected for the 2015\u20132025 period would be largely attributable to decreases in earned income tax credits. The letter continues, stating that H.R. 240 would decrease the amount of earned income tax credits by decreasing the number of people with Social Security numbers, which are required for taxpayers and dependents to qualify for earned income tax credits.\n\nIn essence, since Obama's amnesty gives millions of illegal immigrants Social Security numbers, it will cost American taxpayers billions in new spending on those same illegal immigrants. This CBO letter contradicts Obama's promise to the American people that illegal immigrants given amnesty under his program would not be offered \"the same benefits that citizens receive.\"\n\nThe CBO letter also estimates that amnestied immigrants will pay $22 billion in Social Security payroll taxes over the next ten years. However, like all Social Security recipients, unless they are deported, amnestied immigrants will eventually be a net drain on the Social Security system, taking out far more in benefits than they paid in.",
    " Title: Tea Party Shifts Strategy: Moderate Senate Candidates Receive Support Over Hardcore Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from their 2010 strategy, members of the Tea Party Patriots and Tea Party Express have prioritized winning the Senate over electing hardcore conservatives. Senators Pat Roberts and Scott Brown have received their support, according to The Hill.\n\nThe Tea Party Express has also endorsed South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds for Senate, as reported by The Hill. This \"hold your nose and vote\" attitude, based on the growing awareness among tea party supporters that a moderate win is better than no win at all, has taken root, according to Adam Brandon, Executive Vice President of FreedomWorks.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, president of the Tea Party Patriots, echoed this sentiment, stating that their members consider a Republican-controlled Senate and ousting Majority Leader Harry Reid as their top priority.\n\nThis new approach represents a near 180-degree turn from the principles that propelled the tea party into legislative prominence in the 2010 elections. In 2010, the tea party's mantra was maintaining principles, regardless of potential GOP losses. This shift comes after the tea party failed to win any key battles in the latest primary fight.\n\nSal Russo, founder of the Tea Party Express, explained, \"In 2010, we thought it was very important to get people's attention and so we had to make that statement and challenge the establishment. 2014 was the time to take back the Senate\u2014it wasn't a time to purify the party.\"\n\nThis shift in strategy also follows declarations from Republican Party figures like Karl Rove and Senator Mitch McConnell that tea party influence is harmful to the GOP, a rift that has yet to be fully repaired in recent months.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group that has yet to join the moderate-leaning tea party bandwagon, stated, \"Conservatives didn't take out a hatchet. Mitch McConnell and the establishment Republicans did. There is no evidence they have buried that hatchet, and the grassroots is very, very aware of the establishment-induced rift in the party.\"",
    " Title: Defense Department Inspector General Investigates $400 Million Border Wall Contract Awarded to Fox News-Favored Firm\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Defense Department's internal watchdog is investigating a $400 million border wall contract awarded to North Dakota-based firm Fisher Sand and Gravel Co., which has made multiple appearances on Fox News to advocate for the job. The Pentagon's inspector general sent a letter to House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson on Thursday, announcing an audit of the contract awarded on Dec. 2, 2019, to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona.\n\nThompson, D-Miss., requested the review last week, citing concerns that the proposals did not meet operational requirements and prototypes came in late and over budget. Tommy Fisher, the head of the family business, said on Thursday that \"there will be nothing to find\" in an audit.\n\nThe border wall is one of President Donald Trump's top priorities. He campaigned on a promise to build a \"big beautiful wall\" between the U.S. and Mexico, with Mexico paying for it, and promised to build 450 to 500 miles by the end of 2020. As of Nov. 1, Trump had built 78 miles.\n\nTrump's effort to secure funding for the wall, using money from the Pentagon after Congress refused to fund the wall, has been met with resistance and lawsuits. A federal judge this week blocked the administration from spending some Defense Department money on the barrier, including the contract for Fisher.\n\nFisher had made a number of appearances on Trump's favorite cable news channel, Fox News, discussing his desire to win a contract. However, the firm, which has little experience with such construction, had a previous proposal rejected. Fisher said his company could do the work for $13 million a mile, while the next closest bid was $20 million a mile.\n\nA letter from the Army Corps when Fisher was awarded the contract stated that the company's proposal was both technically acceptable and the best priced. Two administration officials familiar with the matter told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 this year that Trump aggressively pushed the Fisher firm's bid with the heads of Homeland Security and the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages wall contracts. The interference in federal contracting by a president concerned some overseeing the process, but the officials said Trump insisted Fisher could get the wall up faster and cheaper than other bidders. The officials weren't authorized to speak about internal discussions and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThompson had expressed one of his concerns was that officials from Homeland Security, the department managing border security, had toured a private barrier built by the company shortly before the contract was awarded. The Pentagon watchdog said it was assessing how to complete the audit and would formally announce it soon.\n\n\"The company had never been awarded a construction contract before and their wall prototype was late and over budget,\" Thompson said in a statement. \"Given the President's multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence on the Army Corps' contracting decision.\" The award was the second-largest contract in the company's history. Previously, Fisher built highways, sold heavy equipment, and did excavation work. The company unsuccessfully sued the government in April when it was not awarded a similar contract.",
    " Title: Presidential Election 2012: Candidates Make Last-Minute Push in Battleground States\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 United States presidential election approaches, the focus of Sunday morning pre-football television programming shifted from sports to politics. On the eve of the contentious election, political surrogates from both the Republican and Democratic parties engaged in rhetorical sparring about the election's outcome.\n\nDavid Plouffe, a White House adviser who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, expressed confidence on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Obama would be re-elected on Tuesday. In contrast, Mitt Romney's campaign manager, Rich Beeson, predicted a significant victory for Romney, stating that he would win 300 electoral votes, surpassing the 270 necessary to secure the presidency.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama, dismissed Republican claims that Pennsylvania had become a competitive state on Fox News. \"They understand that they're in deep trouble,\" Mr. Axelrod said. \"They understand that the traditional, or the battleground, states that we've been focusing are not working out for them. Now they're looking for somewhere, desperately looking for somewhere.\"\n\nIn the crucial battleground state of Ohio, the Real Clear Politics polling average shows Obama ahead by nearly three percentage points. However, US Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), a prominent Romney campaign surrogate, told CNN's Candy Crowley that he believes the GOP candidate has a good chance of taking the state. \"All the polls are going in the right direction, so I'm very happy about the polling,\" he said. \"I feel very good about Ohio.\"\n\nLast-minute polls indicate a race that is virtually tied. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of likely voters published Sunday shows Obama leading Romney by a narrow margin, 48% to 47%. Another new poll, Politico/George Washington University's battleground tracking poll of 1,000 likely voters, shows the two candidates tied at 48%. The Real Clear Politics national polling average has Obama ahead by a minuscule fraction: 2/10ths of 1%.\n\nPolitico's James Hohmann notes that most of the 3% of remaining undecided voters are unlikely to vote on Tuesday, and the winner will be determined by which candidate can mobilize more of their supporters in the competitive states. This is the aim of both candidates as they make their final push toward Election Day. Obama began his Sunday in New Hampshire before heading to Florida, Ohio, and Colorado, while Romney's schedule included stops in Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\n\nHurricane Sandy, this year's \"October Surprise,\" appears to have benefited Obama as he balances campaigning, meeting with federal emergency management officials, and staying in close touch with state and local officials in states affected by the superstorm. In the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, nearly 70% approved of Obama's handling of the storm. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour acknowledged this on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.\n\nSome Republicans have criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for his focus on the storm response rather than the campaign, with some viewing him as a potential attack dog for the Romney campaign. Speaking after former President Bill Clinton in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night, Obama stated that at this point in the campaign, he was largely \"a prop\" and the race was in the voters' hands. \"The power is not with us anymore,\" he told the estimated crowd of 24,000 gathered on a cold night. \"It's all up to you.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for Accurate and Fair Media Reporting Amidst Recent Violent Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called for the media to report news accurately and fairly, citing inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting as a cause of \"great anger\" in the country. The president's statement, made in a series of tweets on Monday, comes in the wake of a violent week that saw a spate of mail bombs and a shooting that killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump referred to the media as the \"true Enemy of the People,\" reviving a derisive term for the press less than a week after an explosive device was mailed to CNN's New York City offices. The president's tweets were among several punchy messages he sent on Monday, also criticizing Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and describing a caravan of immigrants headed through Mexico to the U.S. border as an \"invasion\" of the country.\n\nCNN reported another suspicious package had been intercepted in Atlanta on Monday morning. The package bombings, which also targeted a number of prominent Democrats, led to the arrest of a suspect on Friday. The president's tweets criticizing the media were not the only ones he sent on Monday; he also called Gillum a \"thief\" and described the immigrant caravan as an \"invasion.\"\n\nGillum is running in a tight contest against a Trump favorite, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, in Florida's governor contest. Trump is headed to Florida on Wednesday to hold a rally in the state. Race has been a part of the heated contest between DeSantis and Gillum, who is black. Gillum has been drawn into a corruption investigation related to his administration, and has come under scrutiny after records showed he accepted a ticket to the musical \"Hamilton\" from an undercover FBI agent who he believed was a local developer.\n\nTrump does not have a crowded public schedule on Monday, which often leads to him tweeting throughout the day against his favorite targets. The president often derides negative coverage of his administration as \"fake news\" and has escalated his attacks in recent months, describing the media as the \"enemy of the people.\" Earlier this month, he praised Rep. Greg Gianforte for body-slamming a reporter last year.\n\nThe president has repeatedly lashed out at the media and his critics in recent days, undercutting his own calls for unity following the shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue and the package bombings. Authorities on Friday charged Cesar Sayoc Jr. with addressing more than a dozen explosive devices to former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), among others. Each intended target has spoken out against the president, and Trump has criticized each person.\n\nThe next day, Robert Gregory Bowers was arrested after police said he opened fire in the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing 11 people and wounding six. Trump condemned both attacks and has vowed that he will not allow political violence to take root in the country. Democrats and the president's critics have suggested that the president's rhetoric has further inflamed the country's divisions, pointing to his attacks on the Democratic Party as an \"angry mob\" and the chants of \"CNN sucks\" and \"lock her up\" that mark his campaign rallies, referring to Hillary Clinton. The tweets on Monday led Democrats and other critics of Trump to double down on their criticism. Trump told reporters before departing for a rally last Friday that he felt he had been restrained in his rhetoric, rejecting calls to tone it down amid the bomb scares. \"I could really tone it up because, as you know, the media's been extremely unfair to me and to the Republican Party,\" Trump said.",
    " Title: CIA Director Warns of Russian Election Interference, While Trump Administration Fails to Implement Sanctions as Expected\n\nArticle:\n\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo has expressed his expectation that Russia will attempt to interfere in the upcoming midterm elections, citing ongoing efforts by Russian intelligence agencies to spread misinformation in the U.S. and Europe as part of a larger strategy to undermine Western politics. Pompeo assured that countermeasures will be taken to minimize the impact on the U.S. elections.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration's response to the issue seems to contradict Pompeo's statements. On Monday, the Trump administration announced that it would not be imposing any new sanctions against foreign companies doing business with blacklisted Russian defense and intelligence bodies, as required by the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The law, which Congress passed last year despite Donald Trump's objections, was expected to apply additional pressure on the Kremlin following Moscow's targeted campaign to help defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump only signed the bill under a veto threat and dismissed it as \"deeply flawed.\" The administration did, however, comply with a CAATSA requirement by publishing a list of 114 Russian politicians and 196 oligarchs with a net worth of $1 billion or more. The timing of the list's release, just before a midnight deadline, has been criticized as dilatory, further highlighting the administration's perceived antipathy towards the law.\n\nThe administration declined to punish anyone on the list, angering critics. Rep. Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated, \"I'm fed up waiting for this administration to protect our country and our elections. They chose instead to let Russia off the hook yet again.\"\n\nCAATSA requires sanctions against large purchasers of Russian arms, but it grants exceptions for various reasons. The exception cited on Monday was that the mere existence of the legislation was deterring such dealings, according to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. The New York Times notes that CAATSA presents the Trump administration with a challenging issue, as several American allies, including India and Turkey, still purchase military equipment from Russia.\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker, who helped write the CAATSA, expressed no concern about the lack of announced new sanctions and suggested that additional sanctions may still be forthcoming. \"This is when sanctions season begins, and so they'll be rolling them out,\" he told reporters on Monday. \"We feel pretty good about the process.\"",
    " Title: GOP Strategists Advise Expanding Campaign Focus Beyond Obamacare for 2014 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican strategists are urging their candidates to expand their campaign focus beyond the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for the 2014 elections, despite the law's unpopularity among conservatives. The Republican Party, with a favorable environment and a competitive lineup of candidates, aims to expand its House majority and take the Senate. However, some within the party are concerned that relying too heavily on Obamacare as a campaign issue may not be sufficient to win over enough voters.\n\nExperts advise the party to transform their criticism of Obamacare into a broader critique of Democrats, addressing other issues and making a broader point about the failures of big-government liberalism. The GOP also needs to demonstrate that they have their own ideas and solutions, as the party brand has been damaged.\n\n\"What we need to do is to convince voters that we have the wherewithal and the ideas to fix issues, to put forward those solutions that can address those concerns,\" said Republican strategist Danny Diaz. \"That is the core component of the argument and one I think you're going to see candidates across [the] country do to a greater degree than they have before.\"\n\nSome House Republicans are already discussing their own proposals on immigration and healthcare, although these are more guidelines than actual legislation. The National Republican Congressional Committee is making a concerted effort to define what the party stands for, with Chairman Greg Walden stating, \"The point is, you need something positive to run on.\"\n\nOther GOP campaigns have already broadened their messages. For example, Mitch McConnell, in Kentucky's race, criticizes his Democratic opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes for her position on coal, an issue of particular resonance in the state's race. Attacks on Obamacare can offer GOP candidates an opening to make a broader point about their opponent.\n\nDespite concerns about focusing too much on Obamacare, the issue's broad-spectrum nature, affecting voters' health care, the country's debt, and the economy, makes it an inherently broad-spectrum attack. This was bolstered this week when the Congressional Budget Office predicted the economy will lose the equivalent of 2.5 million workers by 2024 due to the health law.\n\n\"If James Carville were a Republican, there'd be a sign hanging in his office that said, 'It's Obamacare, stupid,'\" said GOP pollster Glen Bolger. He argued that Republicans shouldn't be worried about dwelling too much on Obamacare; they should be worried about not talking about it enough.\n\n\"Yes, we do need more than just Obamacare,\" he said. \"But we don't need a lot more.\"\n\nIn a close race, the \"more\" that Bolger is talking about could make the difference between winning and losing. And it's why many Republicans, as thrilled with the political gift of Obamacare as they are, aren't ready to bet the house on it just yet.",
    " Title: Misconceptions and Consequences of U.S. Tariffs on Chinese Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have sparked a debate among free market advocates, with some supporting tariffs on Chinese imports despite their usual opposition to trade barriers. The concern is that China's \"Made in China 2025\" plan, aimed at dominating various industries, could lead to China's economic dominance.\n\nGeorge Mason University economist Don Boudreaux has commented on this inconsistency, stating that those on the political right who typically believe in free markets are now supporting trade barriers due to concerns about China's plan. Boudreaux notes that these individuals believe foreign governments, particularly those with authoritarian histories, can improve their economies with subsidies, trade restrictions, and industrial policies, despite the U.S. government's inability to outperform the market in \"picking winners.\"\n\nThe argument that China's overproduction of steel and other goods is detrimental to the U.S. and other countries is puzzling, as it could lower costs for thousands of small U.S. manufacturers and steel consumers. However, this \"overproduction\" is a burden for the Chinese people, as their government's subsidization of steel production diverts resources from other areas of the Chinese economy.\n\nThe notion that trade is the primary cause of the steel industry's struggles is misleading. For decades, the U.S. has imported between 25% and 30% of its steel, leaving domestic steel with a healthy 70% to 75% of the market. The loss of steel jobs is primarily due to labor-saving innovations (technology) implemented by American steel executives, which increased individual steel workers' productivity and wages. Steel employment in the U.S. peaked in 1956, long before China entered the picture.\n\nAnother common argument is that China steals intellectual property from the U.S. However, imposing import taxes (tariffs) to retaliate against China is an inefficient and unfair policy that could put thousands of other American jobs at risk, expose the U.S. to retaliation, and cause U.S. companies to move their production abroad. The best solutions involve using international organizations to challenge China's actions and forming alliances with like-minded allies.\n\nIt is essential to clarify that this article is not a defense of the Chinese regime's human rights abuses or lack of free market economic policies. However, many arguments against China in terms of trade either misidentify the true victims or advocate for the wrong remedies. Furthermore, increased U.S. trade and investment restrictions will not make China more like the U.S., but rather, more government control over the U.S. economy will make the U.S. more like China.",
    " Title: President Trump's Market Claims and Economic Indicators\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been touting the stock market's performance during his presidency, but recent market volatility, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1,500-point drop on February 5, 2020, has raised questions about attributing market fluctuations to a single administration.\n\nDuring the State of the Union address last week, the president highlighted the stock market's growth, stating, \"The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.\" However, when the market experiences a downturn, as it did on February 5, the president's spokespeople have shifted the narrative, stating, \"We're always concerned when the market loses any value, but we're also confident in the economy's fundamentals.\"\n\nThe market's volatility appears to be influenced by two significant factors: the increasing federal deficit due to tax cuts and the potential adjustment of interest rates by the Federal Reserve in response to signs of a heating economy. The tax cuts, which have been implemented without any offsetting spending cuts, will push the deficit higher and bring the debate over the debt ceiling back to Congress. Additionally, the Federal Reserve may adjust interest rates in response to new wage data, causing investor concern.\n\nIt is essential to note that presidents do not control the stock market. While the market can respond to political events, attributing market upswings to a president's policies does not absolve them from responsibility when the market experiences downturns. President Trump's tendency to take credit for factors outside of his control, such as low airline fatalities and Christmas wishes, extends to the stock market as well.\n\nFurthermore, the unemployment rate, which previously reached a low that prompted the president to boast, has spiked back up. As with the stock market, the president neither gets all the credit nor all the blame for economic indicators.",
    " Title: EPA Eases Enforcement of Environmental Regulations in Response to COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a decision to ease enforcement of environmental regulations affecting polluting industries in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The move follows requests from the oil lobby and other industry groups for regulatory relief as governments worldwide grapple with the pandemic's impact, which has infected nearly half a million people, decimated travel, and caused widespread disruptions.\n\nIn a press release, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler stated, \"EPA is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from COVID-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements.\"\n\nThe EPA's memo outlining the changes states that it will not impose fines on polluting industries for violating certain monitoring and reporting requirements during the outbreak. Instead, the EPA will focus its resources on situations that may create an acute risk or imminent threat to public health or the environment.\n\nThe EPA also stated that it does not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the EPA agrees that COVID-19 was the cause.\n\nThe EPA will also work with the Department of Justice to \"exercise enforcement discretion\" related to penalties previously assessed on polluting companies, according to the memo signed by Susan Bodine, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance.\n\nThe changes are retroactive to March 13, 2020. Last week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) asked U.S. President Donald Trump for temporary relief from regulatory requirements on the oil and gas industry to ensure steady fuel supplies during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe API's main concern was that the coronavirus would leave it with limited numbers of healthy staff to run critical operations, making it harder to comply with federal environmental and safety requirements. The oil industry also seeks waivers allowing the sale of winter-grade gasoline deep into spring and summer to deal with a supply glut caused by the coronavirus outbreak's reduction in demand for motor fuels.\n\nThe EPA memo on Thursday did not address fuel waivers. More than a dozen environmental groups criticized the agency for putting the public at risk as it eased its enforcement of air and water protections.\n\n\"Excusing the potential release of excess toxic air pollutants and other pollution that exacerbates asthma, breathing difficulty, and cardiovascular problems in the midst of a pandemic that can cause respiratory failure is irresponsible from a public health perspective,\" said a letter from groups including the Environmental Integrity Project and Wild Earth Guardians.",
    " Title: Walmart Urged to Release Surveillance Tape of John Crawford III Shooting Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nA call for transparency has been made regarding the fatal shooting of John Crawford III, a 22-year-old black man, in a Walmart store in Beavercreek, Ohio last month. The incident, which occurred while Crawford was shopping with his girlfriend, has sparked controversy due to the presence of video evidence that some believe could shed light on the circumstances surrounding his death.\n\nCrawford and his girlfriend had gone to the Walmart to purchase ingredients for a family cookout. While browsing, Crawford picked up an unpackaged BB gun from a store shelf and continued shopping. A man named Ronald Ritchie, who saw Crawford, called 911, stating that a black man was \"walking around with a gun in the store\" and \"pointing it at people.\"\n\nIn a matter of minutes, Crawford was shot by police. The BB gun, which was a toy and unloaded, was found at the scene. Crawford's last words were reportedly, \"It's not real.\"\n\nThe incident has raised questions about implicit bias and the role it may have played in the shooting. Some speculate that Ritchie may have been more likely to perceive danger due to Crawford's race, and that the police may have been more likely to respond with lethal force due to the same factor.\n\nImplicit bias, also known as unconscious bias, is a term used to describe the subtle prejudices that people may hold, even if they are not consciously aware of them. These biases can influence decisions and actions, often without the individual realizing it.\n\nThe release of the surveillance tape is being sought by Crawford's family and thousands of supporters who have signed a petition on ColorOfChange.com. The family believes the tape will demonstrate that Crawford was never a threat and was gunned down in cold blood. Even Ronald Ritchie, the man who called the police, has reportedly changed his story, stating that Crawford never pointed a gun at anyone after seeing the tape.\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine has expressed concerns about releasing the tape, stating that it could potentially bias the jury. However, he has shown no issue with using the tape to clarify facts with Ritchie, a witness for the prosecution, or with media speculation about Crawford's criminal record, which was dropped.\n\nWalmart, the largest employer of black people in the country and a significant retailer for black consumers, has been urged to release the tape to promote transparency and ensure the safety of its customers. The release of the tape could potentially help address the lingering realities of racial bias and contribute to a more open and honest discussion about the issue.",
    " Title: Major Broadcast Networks Ignore Hillary Clinton's Remarks on Job Creation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from standard news coverage, the major English and Spanish broadcast networks have omitted any mention of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's remarks on job creation made during a campaign event for Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley on Friday. Clinton stated, \"Do not let anybody tell you that, you know \u2013 it's corporations and businesses that create jobs. That old theory, trickle-down economics. That has been tried, that has failed.\"\n\nSince her remarks, the English-language networks ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision, have not covered the story in their morning or evening newscasts. This is a stark contrast to how they would typically handle potentially controversial statements from a Republican figure or future presidential hopeful.\n\nOn the Fox News Channel's evening news program, Special Report with Bret Baier, senior political analyst Brit Hume devoted a segment to the subject. After an introduction from Baier, Hume discussed Clinton's comments, stating, \"Hillary Clinton created quite a fervor over the weekend, saying that corporations and businesses do not create jobs.\"\n\nIn response to the backlash, Clinton attempted to clarify her remarks during a campaign event in New York on Monday. She stated, \"Let me be absolutely clear about what I've been saying for a couple of decades: Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in an America where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out \u2013 not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas.\"\n\nDespite Clinton's clarification, the networks have not covered her original remarks or her subsequent \"walk back\" of the statement. With the 2014 midterms taking place next Tuesday and media coverage focusing on Jeb Bush's possible 2016 presidential run, the coverage of Clinton's anti-business statements remains to be seen.\n\nThe full transcript of the segment that aired on FNC's Special Report with Bret Baier on October 27 can be found below.",
    " Title: Capitol Hill Republicans Threaten to Block Climate Funding for Paris Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nCapitol Hill Republicans are seeking to undermine President Obama's push for a global climate agreement at next week's international summit in Paris, with the threat of withholding vital funding if the president attempts to bypass Congress. The two-week U.N. conference, starting Monday under heightened security following the Paris terror attacks, aims to address climate change and build a better future for future generations.\n\nAt a press conference alongside French President Francois Hollande, President Obama described the climate summit as a global statement of solidarity. \"What a powerful rebuke to the terrorists it will be when the world stands as one and shows that we will not be deterred from building a better future for our children,\" Obama said earlier this week.\n\nHowever, at home, the country and Congress remain deeply divided over the president's plans for cutting emissions. Lawmakers are concerned that the president may etch an international pact without seeking Senate approval.\n\nCritics of the president's climate agenda have focused on the president's goal of directing $3 billion, including $500 million in the near-term, for the U.N. Green Climate Fund, which would help developing nations deal with climate change. Ahead of the president's trip, dozens of lawmakers warned the president: \"No vote, no money.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., stated at a hearing last week, \"Without Senate approval, there will be no money \u2013 period.\" He emphasized that any agreement with legally binding requirements must come before the Senate for a vote. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, along with Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, have also sent a letter to Obama urging the president to have his special envoy relay to developing nations' representatives that Congress \"will not be forthcoming\" with the Green Climate Fund money absent a Senate vote.\n\nIn addition, Inhofe joined Manchin and Blunt in introducing a resolution calling for the Senate to have a say in any climate agreement. Republicans generally argue that any deal with legally binding elements should be handled like a treaty and subject to Senate ratification. The Obama administration, however, has given varying statements on how it views any potential pact.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry rattled European officials when he was quoted earlier this month in the Financial Times saying any agreement was \"definitively not going to be a treaty.\" French President Hollande bristled at the notion that a deal would not be legally binding and was quoted saying if that's the case, \"there won't be an agreement.\"\n\nThe State Department clarified that the U.S. wants binding and non-binding components. An official told Politico: \"The FT interview with Secretary Kerry may have been read to suggest that the U.S. supports a completely non-binding approach. That is not the case and that is not Secretary Kerry's position. Our position has not changed: the U.S. is pressing for an agreement that contains provisions both legally binding and non-legally binding.\"\n\nHouse Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, stated at a recent hearing that the president doesn't want to come to Congress with a Paris agreement because \"he knows the Senate will not ratify it.\" Smith also warned a centerpiece of the U.S. commitment that Obama will bring to the table in Paris \u2013 the Clean Power Plan, regulations on power plant emissions \u2013 \"represents massive costs without significant benefits.\"\n\nAs lawmakers threaten to block U.S. support for the U.N. climate fund, The Wall Street Journal reports that the House next week also plans to vote on measures to repeal those EPA rules for power plants, on the heels of the Senate doing the same. It's doubtful Republicans could overcome a presidential veto, but the vote is a reminder of the resistance facing those regulations, which are the subject of a massive federal court case brought by mostly Republican-led states.\n\nThe administration suggests it has high hopes for the summit. Obama struck a climate deal with China before the Paris talks and plans to meet one-on-one with Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2013 as well as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2013 in Paris next week. Ahead of the summit, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told FoxNews.com a historic deal will be reached. \"Everyone has actually realized that there is more risk in not addressing climate change and there is more opportunity in addressing it,\" she said.",
    " Title: House Defeats President Reagan's Tax Reform Bill, Setting a Precedent for Modern Political Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political event that echoes modern-day legislative battles, President Ronald Reagan faced a stunning defeat in the House of Representatives during a crucial vote on a top priority of his second term, tax reform. Although there is a slim chance that he could switch enough votes to reverse the outcome, prospects seem grim.\n\nThe tax reform bill, passed in 1986, marked a turning point in Reagan's legislative agenda. For months, as Reagan worked with the Democratic majority to overhaul the tax code, House Republicans felt increasingly marginalized, believing they were being left out of the process and giving too much to the opposition. GOP leaders aligned with a group of Democrats who disliked the bill and hatched a plan to defeat the procedural rule for considering it.\n\nRemarkably, Reagan managed to secure the necessary votes to get the bill back on track. The President, known as the \"Gipper,\" made an unusual trip to Capitol Hill and asked his partisans to reconsider. He followed up with a letter pledging that he would work for changes in the Senate and that he would veto any final bill that fell short of his objectives. The measure soon passed the House, and after some gyrations in the Senate, it became law in 1986.\n\nThe story of Reagan's tax reform struggle offers a potential lesson for President Obama, who recently suffered a trade defeat. However, Obama's situation differs from Reagan's in several ways that do not work to his advantage.\n\nIn December 1985, Reagan was still popular, with Gallup putting his approval rating at 63 percent. President Obama's approval has been about 20 points lower. Even pro-Obama Democrats still feel disappointment. The artist who created the iconic \"Hope\" poster recently faced the question of whether the president had lived up to it, to which he responded, \"Not even close.\"\n\nWith Reagan's election in 1980, Republicans won their first Senate majority since Eisenhower and picked up a large number of seats in the House. Though they had since lost some ground in the lower chamber, they still had about two dozen more seats in 1985 than before Reagan. Under Obama, by contrast, Democrats have lost their majorities in both chambers. Apart from the presidency, they are now in their weakest position since the 1920s.\n\nSince the GOP controlled the Senate in 1985, Reagan's promise to work for changes in the bill carried some weight. Obviously, Obama cannot do anything similar. In his meeting with House Democrats last week, he took a different tact, suggesting that opponents of the bill were not playing straight. His message backfired and cost him votes instead.\n\nTime is growing short. Ironically, Obama can now pull off a legislative miracle with Democratic liberals only by emulating the man who personified Republican conservatism.",
    " Title: Pew Research Center Poll Reveals Increased Political Polarization Among Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey conducted by the Pew Research Center has revealed a significant increase in political polarization among Americans over the past 20 years. The poll, titled \"Political Polarization in the American Public,\" aimed to understand the extent and nature of political polarization in relation to government, society, and personal lives.\n\nThe survey found that the percentage of Americans who hold either consistently conservative or consistently liberal positions on major issues has doubled over the past decade, accounting for 20 percent of all Americans. Thirty-nine percent of Americans hold equally liberal and conservative positions on issues.\n\nThe survey also found that the most politically active have become increasingly partisan and entrenched in their positions. According to Pew, many Americans who view themselves as consistently conservative or consistently liberal are making their voices heard through greater participation in every stage of the political process, including primary voting, writing letters to officials, volunteering for or donating to a campaign, and amplifying their views.\n\nThe survey also found that Americans who view themselves as consistently conservative or consistently liberal is at a 20-year peak. Ninety-two percent of Republicans are to the right of the median Democrat, compared with 64 percent twenty years ago. Similarly, 94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican, up from 70 percent in 1994.\n\nThe survey also found that these Americans' views are so polarized that most of these intense partisans believe the opposing party's policies are so misguided that they threaten the nation's well-being.\n\nPolitical views also spill over into virtually every area of partisan Americans' lives, according to the study of 10,013 people. Sixty-three percent of consistent conservatives and 49 percent of consistent liberals \u2013 compared with 25 percent of those with mixed ideological views \u2013 told Pew that most of their close friends share their political views.",
    " Title: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Defense of Free Speech Faces Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee in Washington, D.C., on October 23, 2019. In his defense of free expression, Zuckerberg has faced criticism for running a \"hate-speech machine\" and has been boycotted by major American companies.\n\nIn a speech at Georgetown University last fall, Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of free speech and its role in the worldwide fight for democracy. He praised Supreme Court jurisprudence that has strengthened First Amendment protections.\n\nThe reaction to Zuckerberg's stance on free speech has been markedly different in 2020 compared to previous years. Instead of praise, the response has been calls for his removal from his position.\n\nInternet companies are often tasked with drawing the line between permissible and non-permissible content, but the current Facebook controversy is more significant. The company is under attack by left-wing activists who have managed to force a wave of cancellations and seek to influence a social media giant to align with their views.\n\nThe Georgetown speech led activists to view Zuckerberg as a staunch defender of free speech. One point of contention was Zuckerberg's reference to the importance of the First Amendment to the cause of civil rights, which some activists found offensive.\n\nAnother point of contention was Zuckerberg's stance on not censoring politicians or fact-checking political ads. The final straw was Facebook's refusal to act against President Donald Trump's post stating, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\n\nActivists have pursued two lines of attack. One has been to pressure companies to stop advertising with Facebook, and many have joined the advertising boycott. The other has been to associate Facebook with the words \"racism\" and \"hate\" to create the impression that Facebook profits from neo-Nazi posts rather than from ordinary users who find the platform useful.\n\nDespite the backlash, Facebook's stance on free speech has been defended by some, including the author of this article. The public benefits from a robust online debate, where individuals can make their own decisions about the merits of political figures' statements. The stakes are high, as Facebook is an institution too big to cancel, and the advertising boycott has minimal impact on the company's revenue. If Zuckerberg can be pressured into abandoning his support for a free-speech-centric approach to his platform, it could serve as a significant warning in a period of national life full of them.",
    " Title: Federal Lawsuit Filed Over University of California at Berkeley's Handling of Conservative Speakers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley) is facing a federal lawsuit over its handling of conservative speakers, following a series of incidents that have sparked controversy and prompted a rebuke from President Trump on Twitter. The lawsuit, filed on Monday, alleges that UC Berkeley's unwritten policy regarding \"high-profile speakers\" unconstitutionally discriminates against unpopular viewpoints.\n\nThe Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) and Young America's Foundation (YAF) argue that the policy, adopted after violent protests led to the cancellation of a February 1 appearance by former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, unlawfully restricts free speech. As a result, UC Berkeley canceled a scheduled speech by conservative commentator Ann Coulter and offered to reschedule it for next Tuesday afternoon, during the \"dead week\" between classes and exams.\n\nBCR and YAF claim that the university has not applied the restrictions imposed in the name of public safety to left-leaning speakers, and that these restrictions amount to an \"unlawful heckler's veto\" that marginalizes conservative voices. The organizations also cite the cancellation of a talk by conservative journalist David Horowitz, who was scheduled to speak on April 12, due to the university's insistence on an inconvenient location and an early end time.\n\nPresident Trump, in a tweet following the February Milo Yiannopoulos incident, suggested that UC Berkeley risks losing federal funds if it \"does not allow free speech.\" However, the administration's commitment to protecting First Amendment rights has been questioned, as it has reportedly demanded that Twitter reveal the identity of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) critic and is considering criminal charges against individuals who share classified information leaked by others.\n\nLast month, a special agent in charge at Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a division of DHS, issued a summons to Twitter seeking records that would unmask the person or persons behind the @ ALT_USCIS account, which regularly criticizes the Trump administration's immigration policies. The summons, which appeared to be a blatant attempt to intimidate critics, was dropped the day after Twitter filed a lawsuit arguing that it threatened the First Amendment right to engage in pseudonymous political speech.\n\nDHS Inspector General John Roth is currently investigating whether the CBP summons was \"improper.\" Last week, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) inquired about government inquiries that might have a \"chilling effect on individuals' free speech rights.\" Meanwhile, the Justice Department is reportedly considering prosecuting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for sharing classified documents with the public, a move that could set a precedent for criminalizing common journalistic practices.\n\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo has stated that Assange is not a real journalist, a debatable and constitutionally irrelevant point. The \"freedom of the press\" guaranteed by the First Amendment is not the freedom of people who work for officially recognized news outlets; it is the freedom to use technologies of mass communication. This freedom extends to everyone in the United States, whether or not they are professional journalists or American citizens. If Assange broke the Espionage Act by distributing classified material within the U.S., that means he used \"the press\" there.\n\nTrump, who once declared \"I love WikiLeaks!\" when it was revealing embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton, has since changed his tune, stating, \"It's OK with me.\" The article does not provide further details about the potential criminal case against Assange.",
    " Title: Chris Rock's Insight on Inequality and the American Dream\n\nArticle:\n\nComedian Chris Rock's recent comments on inequality and the American Dream during an interview with Frank Rich have sparked discussion, with his remarks on the public's perception of wealth disparity being particularly noteworthy. In the interview, Rock stated, \"If poor people knew how rich rich people are, there would be riots in the streets.\"\n\nRock's assertion, on a factual basis, is supported by multiple studies that show Americans significantly underestimate the degree of inequality in the U.S. economy. For instance, a study found that subjects estimated the top 20 percent of U.S. households owned about 59 percent of the country's net worth, while the actual figure is closer to 84 percent.\n\nRock's statement goes beyond the reality of inequality itself and touches upon the public's perception of American society and its influence on politics. He expanded his remarks to include the \"average person,\" stating that they too would be outraged and bewildered by the lifestyle of the 1 percent.\n\nThe sustainability of such inequality in the U.S., as compared to other democracies, is attributed to the American Dream, a long-standing belief in the possibility of upward mobility through hard work and perseverance. However, a recent study by Gregory Clark, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, suggests that the American Dream is no longer operational today. Clark argues that social mobility today does not fulfill the American Dream's promises and, in fact, never did.\n\nClark's findings challenge the notion that the American Dream, with its promise of upward mobility, has been a significant factor in papering over the gap between perception and reality in U.S. society. As more Americans come to terms with the reality of the American Dream, the 1 percent and the stewards of government may face increased challenges.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Hold First Post-Election Meeting at the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Barack Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, held their first meeting since the election at the White House on Thursday. The lunch, which took place in the White House's private dining room, marked the fulfillment of a promise Obama made in his victory speech on November 6.\n\nThe conversation between the two presidential contenders focused on America's global leadership and the importance of maintaining that position. According to the White House, Romney congratulated the president on his successful campaign and wished him well for the upcoming four years.\n\nThe lunch menu consisted of white turkey chili and Southwestern grilled chicken salad. The meeting, lasting over an hour, was reportedly their most extensive private talk to date, with limited interactions between the two during the 2012 election, confined primarily to the three presidential debates.\n\nPrior to the lunch, Romney and his former running mate, Paul Ryan, had a meeting to discuss the economic challenges facing Washington. Details of this meeting were not disclosed, as the aide who provided the information was not authorized to discuss the private discussions.\n\nThe economic debate between Obama and Romney during the campaign centered on the expiring tax cuts first enacted during the George W. Bush administration. The two candidates had differing views on the matter, with Romney advocating for the extension of the cuts for all income earners, while Obama ran on a pledge to let the cuts expire for families earning more than $250,000 a year.\n\nThe White House views Obama's victory as a sign of public support for his tax proposals. Since his election loss, Romney has largely remained out of the political limelight, spending the past three weeks in seclusion at his family's California home. He has made no public appearances, drawing media attention only after being photographed at Disneyland, as well as visits to the movies and the gym with his wife, Ann.",
    " Title: Boko Haram Releases Video Showing Over 100 Kidnapped Schoolgirls; Negotiations for Their Release Underway\n\nArticle:\n\nA new video believed to be from the Nigerian terror group Boko Haram shows over 100 kidnapped Christian schoolgirls praying in Arabic and declaring their conversion to Islam. The video, obtained by the Associated Press, features Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, who is reportedly negotiating with the Nigerian government for the release of the girls in exchange for imprisoned militants.\n\nIn the 27-minute video, the girls, ranging in age from 15 to 18, are seen wearing black and gray hijabs and reciting the Koran. Some appear fearful or desolate, while one girl stated in the video that they had not been harmed. Three of the girls are shown speaking in the video, with two stating they were Christian and had converted to Islam, and the other stating she is Muslim.\n\nShekau is seen in military fatigues cradling an assault rifle on the video, which is imprinted with the Boko Haram insignia. The United States put a $7 million bounty on Shekau's head last year. The video is the first sighting of the abducted girls since more than 300 were taken from their school in the northern town of Chibok by Islamist militants on April 14. Although more than 50 girls have escaped their captors and are now safe, at least 276 remain missing.\n\nThe search for the missing girls has centered on the Sambisa forest, with Nigerian troops being aided by advisers from the U.S., Britain, and France. The U.S. has more than 50 military personnel and advisors based at the Nigerian Embassy to help \"advise and assist\" in the search for the missing girls. The teams have expertise in communications, logistics, civil affairs, and intelligence. There are no plans to put additional U.S. military forces on the ground in Nigeria.\n\nWhen asked about the video, U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said U.S. intelligence agents are hoping to use it to help rescue the girls. \"We have no reason to question its authenticity. Our intelligence experts are combing through every detail of the video for clues that might help in ongoing efforts to secure the release of the girls,\" Psaki said.\n\nThe video emerged as the Nigerian government reportedly made \"indirect contact\" with Boko Haram. The Nigerian government has been heavily criticized for how it has conducted its search for the missing girls, who were taken after taking final exams. On Friday, the group Amnesty International claimed that Nigerian security forces were aware that a convoy of fighters from Boko Haram was approaching the town of Chibok four hours before the kidnapping but did nothing to stop the kidnappings. It is believed that 53 girls were able to escape the kidnappers. One of them, 19-year-old Sarah Lawan, told the Associated Press that her ordeal was \"too terrifying for words\" and added that she was afraid to go back to school.\n\nBoko Haram, whose name, loosely translated, means \"Western education is forbidden,\" is believed to have killed approximately 1,500 people in Nigeria so far this year and has been waging an insurgency in the country for the past five years. Shekau claimed credit for the abductions in a video last week, saying, \"I abducted your girls! By Allah, I will sell them in the marketplace!\"",
    " Title: Pro-Life Movement Shifts Focus After House Flips to Pro-Choice Majority\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the U.S. midterm elections, the pro-life movement has faced a significant setback as the House of Representatives has transitioned into a pro-choice majority, while the Senate has seen an increase in pro-life lawmakers. Mallory Quigley, a spokesperson for the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA), expressed her concerns about the shift, stating, \"We cannot get around the fact that this is certainly a loss for the pro-life movement, that the House, which has been a vanguard, is now going to be back in the hands of someone like Nancy Pelosi who is absolutely an abortion radical.\"\n\nIn light of this development, pro-life activists, such as Quigley, are refocusing their efforts on preventing federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Quigley stated, \"This is a fight that we have to take up, a mantle that we have to pick up every day.\" SBA teams began door-to-door canvassing in July and, according to Quigley, their efforts resulted in a reliably pro-life Senate.\n\nQuigley emphasized the importance of the Senate, as it serves as a crucial platform for the confirmation of Supreme Court justices. She noted the battles to confirm Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, and expressed optimism that future nominations by President Donald Trump, who is considered the most pro-life president in American history, would not be blocked by pro-choice senators like Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Susan Collins (ME).\n\nTrump, in his 2018 address to tens of thousands of activists during the March for Life, reaffirmed his commitment to the pro-life cause, stating, \"Every child is a precious gift from God.\" In his presidential campaign, he pledged to take several actions to protect life, and Quigley noted that he has been keeping his promises.\n\nIn the near future, the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to finalize the \"Protect Life Rule,\" which will cut off approximately $60 million in funding for Planned Parenthood, the organization's second-largest source of funding. If Planned Parenthood continues to perform abortions, they will no longer receive Title X funding.\n\nDespite the loss of a pro-life majority in the House, Quigley remains optimistic, stating, \"It's a very encouraging time to be pro-life.\" SBA teams are expected to resume door-to-door canvassing in 2020 to rally the pro-life vote.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Prepares for Vote on Impeachment Inquiry Procedures, Despite Lack of Support Among Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives' impeachment process, despite parliamentary procedures, consists of three straightforward steps. First, the House authorizes the Judiciary Committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry. Next, the committee conducts an investigation to determine if the president has committed any offense warranting removal from office. Finally, if such evidence is discovered, the full House votes to approve one or more articles of impeachment.\n\nCurrently, the Democrats, despite accusations of wrongdoing at the White House, lack the necessary votes in the House to initiate the first step toward removing President Trump. As a result, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has decided to conduct an impeachment inquiry, a move that has been criticized by some Democrats.\n\nOver the weekend, CNN reported that the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to vote next week on a resolution outlining the procedures for its investigation. The vote, expected to occur on Wednesday, will establish the ground rules for conducting hearings now that the committee has publicly announced it is considering recommending articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a Democratic presidential candidate, is among those who oppose the impeachment inquiry. She stated, \"I don't support impeachment. I think it's important for us to think about what is in the best interest of the country and the American people, and continuing to pursue impeachment is something that I think will only further tear our country apart.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has arranged the rules to exclude Rep. Gabbard from the next presidential debate, reflecting her disagreement with the party's far-left faction. However, she aligns with moderate Democrats, who are likely to face the consequences of Nadler's plan to cater to the radical left.\n\nVulnerable Democrats and cautious consultants, as well as a majority of the electorate, oppose Nadler's expanded impeachment inquiry. A solid majority of voters are against impeachment, according to various public opinion polls, including the latest Monmouth University Poll, which found little support for investigations and less for impeachment.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee's actions have been criticized by both sides of the political aisle. Sen. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, told Fox News that the impeachment inquiry is a \"show\" and a \"publicity stunt\" driven in part by Nadler's desire to avoid a primary challenge from the left. Collins also suggested that Nadler's inquiry is a desperate measure to prevent Trump from being reelected while the GOP recaptures the few seats it needs to deprive the Democrats of their House majority.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry's legitimacy and purpose have been questioned by many, including Sen. Collins, who expressed sympathy for Nadler, stating, \"This is really pathetic. Nothing like this has ever happened in the House before.\"",
    " Title: Trump Defends Sharing ISIS Threat Information with Russian Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, President Donald Trump defended his decision to share sensitive information about an Islamic State terrorist threat with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak during a White House meeting last week.\n\nTrump stated that he had the \"absolute right\" to reveal \"facts\" to the Russian officials for \"humanitarian reasons,\" with the aim of encouraging Russia to intensify its fight against ISIS and terrorism.\n\n\"As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety,\" Trump tweeted. \"Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's statement contradicts that of his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who, on Monday night, told reporters outside the West Wing that the president did not disclose \"intelligence sources or methods.\"\n\nMcMaster's statement was in response to a Washington Post report that claimed Trump \"went off script\" during the meeting and discussed details about an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.\n\n\"The story that came out tonight, as reported, is false,\" McMaster said. \"The president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. At no time\u2014at no time\u2014were intelligence sources or methods discussed.\"\n\nDina Powell, who serves as the deputy national security adviser for strategy, also denied the story in a statement, saying, \"This story is false. The president only discussed the common threats that both countries faced.\"\n\nThe Washington Post report also stated that the information Trump shared had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government.\n\n\"I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,\" Trump said, according to the Washington Post report.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Accuses President Obama of Lying in Debate Ad\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie has accused President Barack Obama of lying in a campaign advertisement attacking Mitt Romney's economic plan. During an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Christie stated that President Obama's accusation that Romney wants to cut taxes for the wealthy is false.\n\n\"Stop lying, Mr. President...Governor Romney is not talking about more tax cuts for the wealthy. In fact, what he said is that the wealthy will pay just as much under a Romney administration as they pay today,\" Christie said.\n\nThe Obama campaign released an advertisement last week that accused Romney of sticking with policies that led to the financial crisis in 2008. In the advertisement, President Obama stated, \"Governor Romney believes that with even bigger tax cuts for the wealthy, and fewer regulations on Wall Street, all of us will prosper. In other words, he'd double down on the same trickle-down policies that led to the crisis in the first place.\"\n\nWhite House senior adviser David Plouffe, who was interviewed after Christie's interview, called the accusation that the president was lying \"not true.\" Plouffe stated, \"Analysts have looked at this. Someone who makes over $3 million a year would get over a $250,000 tax cut if Governor Romney's plan were to be enacted.\"\n\nPlouffe also stated that the notion that the middle class would be unaffected by Romney's tax cuts is false. \"The middle class needs to understand, if - if Mitt Romney wins this presidential election, they're going to be paying the bill, not to reduce the deficit, not to reduce jobs, but to give huge tax cuts to the wealthy,\" he said.\n\nChristie also stated that Romney would perform well in the upcoming debate and that it would be a positive turning point for his campaign. Plouffe, on the other hand, stated that the president would lay out his plan for the next four years during the debate.\n\nThe first presidential debate is scheduled for Wednesday, October 3.",
    " Title: Mueller's Investigation of President Trump: Trump Not a \"Criminal Target,\" but Still Under Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller reportedly informed President Trump's legal team in March that the president is not a \"criminal target\" of the Russia investigation, but rather a \"subject\" in the probe. This may offer Trump a sense of relief, but legal experts clarify that it does not indicate Trump is out of the woods regarding the Russia investigation.\n\nThe term \"target\" refers to an individual whom investigators believe has committed a crime and are likely planning to bring charges against. Being labeled a \"subject,\" however, means that Mueller is examining Trump's conduct for evidence of a crime, but has no immediate plans to bring charges.\n\nAndrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, stated, \"Being a subject is better than being a target of a criminal investigation by a federal grand jury, but it is cold comfort. In effect, Robert Mueller told the Trump legal team that he is investigating the president's conduct but has not determined as yet whether the president has committed specific federal crimes.\"\n\nIt's crucial to consider the context of the \"criminal target\" comments, which were made in relation to a potential Mueller interview of Trump under oath. Mueller's staff reportedly wants to question Trump about why he fired FBI Director James Comey and what Trump knew about contacts between his team and Russian officials.\n\nTrump himself is said to want to sit down with Mueller's staff, and his legal team is divided over whether it's a good idea. Saying that Trump isn't a target doesn't impede Mueller's investigation into his conduct, and might increase the likelihood of Trump agreeing to an interview.\n\nMiriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former federal prosecutor, explained, \"It's important to stress the fluidity between categories. Depending on the prosecutor's case, a subject can very quickly become a target (and although less likely, a target might for some reason morph back into a subject).\"\n\nIt's also possible that Mueller views Trump as a subject rather than a target because he has concluded he literally cannot indict Trump. White House lawyers have argued since the Nixon administration that the president cannot face criminal charges because it would interfere with their ability to run the country. Legal experts disagree on whether this is correct, but many believe that Mueller wouldn't risk testing this theory in court.\n\nJens David Ohlin, a professor of law at Cornell, stated, \"Mueller may believe that he can't currently indict Trump no matter how much evidence he has against him. Designating him a'subject' as opposed to a 'target' may reflect nothing more than the fact that Trump is the current occupant of the Oval Office.\"\n\nMueller reportedly insists that he needs to interview Trump before he can finish his investigation, but Trump's lawyers have hesitated to allow Trump to testify, partially based on Trump's history. In the past, Trump has been known to exaggerate or lie during testimony, as evidenced by his deposition in the 2007 lawsuit brought by journalist Timothy O'Brien.\n\nO'Brien's lawyers caught Trump lying 30 times during the deposition, acknowledging that he had repeatedly exaggerated or outright misrepresented facts about his business in the past. Even if Mueller can't charge Trump criminally, lying under oath is what led to Bill Clinton's impeachment.",
    " Title: House to Discontinue NSA Phone Data Collection Program Due to Expiration of Patriot Act Provision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the House of Representatives is set to discontinue the National Security Agency (NSA) phone data collection program, as the provision of the USA Patriot Act that allows for such collection will not be renewed after its expiration at the end of 2015. This decision was announced by Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who was the chief author of the Patriot Act in 2001.\n\nSensenbrenner stated that there are not sufficient votes in the House to renew Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which permits the government to collect data from businesses without a warrant. He added that the intelligence community has expanded, rather than limited, its data-gathering efforts after Congress tried to rein them in.\n\nThe revelation of the NSA phone data collection program, following former NSA employee Edward Snowden's disclosure of details last month, has sparked a major debate in Congress. In Wednesday's hearing, lawmakers expressed concerns about the program, with some accusing the administration of trying to hide it.\n\nAdministration officials who testified during the hearing acknowledged that they had the technology to track ATM transactions and the locations of cellphones on which they are already gathering metadata. They also admitted that they had not sought permission for the existing program, which some lawmakers criticized.\n\nIn a four-page letter to Sensenbrenner this week, Peter J. Kadzik, principal deputy assistant attorney general, outlined the administration's reasoning for the program's justification. He stated that the bulk collection of telephony metadata is necessary to identify terrorist-related telephony metadata records and to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities.\n\nUnder the terms of the program, phone companies turn over the data, which is then stored by the government for five years. However, officials stated that they can only query the data to look for specific numbers if they have a \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" that someone is involved with terrorism.\n\nThe administration officials also noted that they involve all three branches of government by regularly briefing some congressional committees about the program, undergoing rigorous review within the executive branch, and seeking approval for collecting the data from the special secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court every 90 days.\n\nHowever, members of Congress have expressed a preference for the FISA courts to sign off before anyone goes digging through the data, rather than leaving that decision to 22 employees at the NSA. This preference reflects concerns about the potential for abuse of power and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the program.",
    " Title: U.S. Senators Express Concern Over International Implications of State Marijuana Legalization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Attorney General Eric Holder, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa have expressed concern over the Obama administration's decision to allow states like Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia to legalize recreational marijuana. The senators argue that this decision violates federal law and U.S. obligations under the United Nations Convention on Narcotics.\n\nThe senators' letter, sent on Jan. 6, states that the Department of Justice's decision to defer its right to challenge legalization laws to the states has put the United States in a difficult position regarding its compliance with international treaties. They argue that the nation's position as a global leader against drugs has been weakened by this decision.\n\nIn 2013, the Justice Department issued a clarification of federal drug policy, stating that it would defer to state laws regarding marijuana legalization. The letter sets a deadline of Feb. 1 for Kerry to clarify the State Department's interpretation of the treaties.\n\nThe senators' concerns are shared by United Nations officials, who have spoken out after Assistant Secretary of State William Brownfield called for a \"flexible interpretation\" of UN Drug Control Conventions last October. Brownfield stated that nations should \"accept the fact that some countries will have very strict drug approaches\" and \"we must have some tolerance for those differing policies.\"\n\nAfter the November elections, Yury Fedotov, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, stated he did not \"see how [the new laws] can be compatible with existing conventions.\"\n\nTom Angell of the Marijuana Majority agrees with the senators that there is an inconsistency. He told The Washington Post, \"When the U.S. has legal marijuana, it makes it difficult for U.S. officials to go around the world and say they should continue to prohibit marijuana.\"\n\nAngell also agrees with the senators' request for the Justice Department to put together, by Feb. 15, a plan to compile information on the impact of legalization \"disaggregated by state and comparable over time, so that data before and after the legalization of marijuana can be compared.\"\n\nFeinstein and Grassley, who serve as co-chairs of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, have worked together before on anti-drug efforts and released a report in December outlining recommendations on ways to counter illicit activities and corruption surrounding the Afghan drug trade.",
    " Title: Al Qaeda's Persistence: Experts Warn of Resurgence Despite US Embassy Closures and Osama bin Laden's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nThe killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 and the absence of any Al Qaeda-orchestrated terrorist attacks on US soil since 9/11 may have led some Americans to perceive Al Qaeda as a diminished or obsolete threat. However, the recent extension of US embassy and consulate closures across the Middle East and Africa, as well as an increased focus on Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, has prompted several terrorism experts to caution against such assumptions.\n\nFactors such as the post-Arab Spring chaos in the Middle East and the Obama administration's drone-strike wars in Pakistan and Yemen have contributed to a different but no less lethal Al Qaeda than the one that carried out the 9/11 attacks, according to these experts.\n\nBill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal, which tracks and analyzes the \"global war on terror,\" states, \"Those who have been claiming Al Qaeda has been defeated or is on its death bed either have bad analysis or have been dishonest with the American people.\"\n\nRoggio argues that the expansion of Al Qaeda affiliates in regions where the US government acknowledges they are growing in size and reach contradicts claims of the terrorist organization's defeat. Bruce Riedel, a leading terrorism analyst and director of the Brookings Institution's Intelligence Project, concurs, stating, \"The Arab Spring has engendered a lot of chaos across the Arab world and broader Middle East, and Al Qaeda thrives on chaos.\"\n\nRiedel points to recent large jailbreaks by Al Qaeda prisoners in Iraq, Pakistan, and Libya, and adds that such actions in quick succession, coupled with the past month's spike in Al Qaeda-originated violence in Iraq and successes in Syria, suggest Al Qaeda's resurgence.\n\nHowever, some terrorism experts argue that the new Al Qaeda affiliates are primarily focused on local insurgencies and local goals, such as establishing strict Islamist states in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Riedel and others caution against drawing this conclusion, stating that Al Qaeda's leadership and affiliate leaders have expressed a global agenda.\n\nRiedel cites last January's deadly attack by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) on an Algerian gas plant, which targeted the large number of Western workers present, as evidence of Al Qaeda's global ambitions. The Long War Journal's Roggio notes that it was less than four years ago that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) dispatched a terrorist who attempted to detonate a bomb in his underwear on a flight over Detroit.\n\nSome experts interpret the closings of US diplomatic facilities across the Middle East and parts of Africa as evidence that a weakened Al Qaeda has shifted its focus to regional targets. However, Roggio counters this argument by citing Al Qaeda's historical track record, particularly the eight-year time lag between the two World Trade Center attacks, during which Al Qaeda continued to refine its plans and carry out attacks such as the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden and the August 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa.\n\nRoggio also warns of the potential for a similar \"if-at-first-you-don't-succeed\" mentality in the efforts of a Saudi citizen thought to be AQAP's chief bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, who is believed to be experimenting with new failsafe bombs and training a class of bomb makers to take over should the US succeed in taking him out with a drone strike.\n\nBrookings' Riedel sounds another cautionary note for Americans who might have thought Al Qaeda was a threat of the past, stating that much of the success at \"depleting\" Al Qaeda's core leadership in Pakistan is a result of US pressure, but that this success could quickly be reversed if that pressure subsides as a result of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan at the end of 2014. Riedel warns, \"Reduce the US presence and focus, and we can expect a rapid regeneration of Al Qaeda in Pakistan.\" And no one has much doubt about where Al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan would like to carry out a successful attack.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Support for CARES Act Highlights Lack of Meaningful Differences Between Democrats and Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe $2 trillion CARES Act, the largest spending bill in U.S. history, passed with a unanimous vote in the Senate, despite four absent senators. In the House of Representatives, the bill passed on a voice vote, with no individual members going on record supporting it. This bipartisan response to the coronavirus pandemic highlights the lack of meaningful differences between the Democrats and Republicans, as one of the dissenters, Rep. Justin Amash (MI-03), a Michigan independent, officially submitted a no vote.\n\nAmash, who consistently criticized the CARES Act for favoring corporations and special interests over individuals, expressed his dissent in a series of tweets. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) both issued statements criticizing Amash's vote. In response, Amash tweeted, \"There's about as much independent thinking here as there is in Congress.\"\n\nThe DCCC tweeted, \"Congressman Justin Amash officially submitted his 'no' vote in the congressional record on the bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that puts #FamiliesFirst amid the COVID-19 pandemic. #MI03 'During a national crisis, it's unfortunate that Congressman Justin Amash would once again adhere to an extreme, out-of-touch ideology, even when it means risking the health, well-being, and economic security of thousands of #MI03.'\"\n\nThirty minutes later, the NRCC tweeted, \"Congressman Justin Amash officially submitted his 'no' vote in the congressional record on the bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that puts #FamiliesFirst amid the COVID-19 pandemic. #MI03 'During a national crisis, it's unfortunate that Congressman Justin Amash would once again work against President Trump, even when it means risking the health, well-being, and economic security of thousands of #MI03.'\"\n\nThe lack of meaningful differences between the two parties is further evidenced by the increasing federal spending over the past two decades. Since 2000, there have only been three years in which federal spending declined year over year (2010, 2012, and 2013). Since Donald Trump's election in 2016, Washington has increased real spending by $1,441 per person, with more federal spending increases expected before the end of the fiscal year on September 30. The 2020 budget was already a record-high $4.8 trillion; it will likely end up coming in somewhere between $6 trillion and $7 trillion.\n\nDespite disagreements about spending priorities, the identical responses to Amash's dissent and the consistent increase in federal spending suggest a fundamental agreement between Democrats and Republicans on more fundamental issues.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms William Barr as Attorney General, Placing Him in Charge of Mueller's Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general on Thursday, installing a seasoned lawyer with decades of Washington experience to head the Justice Department and oversee Special Counsel Robert Mueller's long-running investigation into potential collusion between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nThe Senate voted 54 to 45, largely along party lines. A Justice Department spokeswoman stated that Barr will be sworn in at 4:45 PM ET in the Oval Office of the White House by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nMany Democrats opposed Barr due to concerns he might not make Mueller's findings fully public. However, the Senate is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, ensuring Barr's confirmation.\n\n\"Today is a great day for the Department of Justice with the confirmation of William Barr to be the next Attorney General,\" said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. \"He is a steady hand at a time of turmoil and he will bring much-needed reform to the Department of Justice.\"\n\nPreviously attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under President George H.W. Bush, Barr has won praise from lawmakers in both parties for his expertise and grasp of the workings of the Justice Department.\n\nBarr will be the third man to occupy that post in barely two years, replacing acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who replaced Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump ousted Sessions last November after criticizing him repeatedly.\n\nMueller is investigating meddling by Russia in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and whether Moscow colluded with Trump's campaign to try to influence the election in Trump's favor, as well as possible obstruction of justice.\n\nBefore being nominated, Barr wrote a 19-page legal memo, in which he called part of Mueller's probe into whether the president obstructed justice \"fatally flawed.\" He shared it with Trump's legal team and Justice Department officials.\n\nBarr has stated he will not let himself be bullied by Trump and will protect the integrity of Mueller's investigation and make public as many of its findings as he can. Barr has not promised to release Mueller's report in its entirety. He has warned he may not be allowed to reveal the identities of people who escape prosecution. That stance troubles many Democrats, who say Barr's expansive views of executive power might lead him to suppress parts of the report.\n\n\"The Justice Department needs a leader who will be independent of the White House and who is able to stand up to President Trump,\" said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, in a statement. \"Bill Barr hasn't demonstrated that he would be that independent leader.\"\n\nDespite Democrats' opposition, many were anxious to have Barr installed quickly so he would replace Whitaker, whose tenure has been fraught with controversy since Trump appointed him in November. Critics have alleged Whitaker's appointment was unlawful. Democrats fear Trump installed Whitaker to undermine Mueller's probe because Whitaker had criticized it when he was a conservative pundit.\n\nBarr is widely expected to back many of Trump's tough immigration policies. He will also be under the microscope for how he implements a new law that eases prison sentences for non-violent criminals, after he advocated for the opposite, tough-on-crime approach for decades.",

Six-week rookie Officer Aurash Zarkeshan remains in critical condition after also being shot during the same incident.\n\nOn Monday, CBS Evening News provided a brief 16-second news report on the shooting, but neither ABC nor NBC mentioned the incident. ABC News, however, did publish an online report by Christina Carrega, which detailed the events leading up to the shooting.\n\nAccording to Tulsa Police Chief Wendell Franklin, the suspect refused to comply with officers' commands to step out of his car. Sergeant Johnson displayed a stun gun and asked the suspect to exit the car 12 times before firing. A struggle ensued, and the suspect pulled out a gun and fired \"several shots at close range,\" striking both officers in the head.\n\nBoth officers were taken to the hospital in critical condition. Sergeant Johnson died on Tuesday afternoon, leaving behind a wife and two young sons. Officer Zarkeshan remains in critical condition.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Fox News Channel's Fox and Friends discussed the shooting incident, with co-anchor Brian Kilmeade bringing up the slaying to retired Dallas police officer C' Mone Wingo. Wingo expressed her concern about the increasing demonization of police officers in society.\n\nMeanwhile, the networks have been promoting efforts to \"defund the police,\" and NBC has scoffed at the fact that police officers are being increasingly targeted in attacks. NBC also criticized President Trump's \"unusual step\" to continue \"defending\" the police.\n\nCBS's brief news report and lack of follow-up on the incident has raised questions about the level of national media coverage of the shooting. The networks' promotion of efforts to \"defund the police\" and their criticism of the police have been met with criticism from some quarters, with concerns that such coverage may contribute to the increasing targeting of police officers in attacks.",
    " Title: Jared Kushner Fined for Late Financial Disclosure\n\n Article:\n\n President Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been fined $200 by the U.S. government for failing to disclose recent financial transactions on time as required by federal law. The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) ordered Kushner to pay the fine for not timely notifying the government of transactions that occurred in February involving JCK Cadre LLC, a holding company in his name with a stake in a successful New York tech startup, McClatchy reported on Thursday.\n\n At least 18 members of the Trump administration filed late financial disclosure statements with the ethics office this year, including Kushner, according to data collected by a Democratic opposition research firm, American Bridge 21st Century, and confirmed by McClatchy. The report stated that Trump's former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, was four days late with his filing, and Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was 23 days behind with her own paperwork. Chief strategist Steve Bannon was more than a month tardy in filing his personal financial disclosure statement, and Christopher Ford, a member of the president's National Security Council, filed his 46 days behind schedule, said American Bridge.\n\n \"President Trump acts like the rules for the rest of us don't apply to him, and now his entire administration is doing the same,\" Harrell Kirstein, a spokesperson for the group, told McClatchy.\n\n Individuals required to file financial disclosure statements with the government are typically subject to fines if they're 30 days late in doing so, McClatchy reported, though fees are sometimes waived. Kushner, however, failed to disclose on time a pair of transactions from February 17 involving JCK Cadre each valued at between $100,000 and $250,000, according to an ethics filing dated July 20 and published by McClatchy on Thursday.\n\n The federal government assessed fees last year on just 3.6 percent of the 12,000 staffers who filed late periodic transaction reports, making Kushner's penalty a rare occurrence, McClatchy reported.\n\n The White House declined to comment on the record, but a Trump administration official familiar with the matter told McClatchy that Kushner will pay the fine.\n\n Kushner, 36, married the president's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, in 2009. Combined, the couple disclosed assets valued at between $206 million and $760 million in separate disclosures filed with the OGE last month. \"Jared and Ivanka have followed each of the required steps in their transition from private citizens to federal officials,\" their attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement following last month's filings.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Grants Unprecedented Access to Bergdahl Family During Son's Captivity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration granted unprecedented access to the parents of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl by allowing them to participate in a series of secure video conferences with senior military and government officials during their son's five-year captivity in Afghanistan. This access, according to a former government official involved in American hostage issues, is unparalleled in such situations, and questions have been raised about the potential disclosure of sensitive information.\n\nIn June 2009, Sgt. Bergdahl went missing in Afghanistan, prompting the Obama administration to approve an outreach program that involved the Bergdahls traveling from their home in Hailey, Idaho, to the state's National Guard headquarters in Boise. There, they were connected to secure video conferences with representatives of U.S. Central Command, the White House, the State Department, and intelligence officials.\n\nRobert Bergdahl, Sgt. Bergdahl's father, has expressed concern for prisoners at the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In May 2014, the U.S. released five senior Taliban commanders in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl, who was held by the violent Haqqani Network, a Taliban ally.\n\nAir Force Col. Timothy Marsano, Idaho's National Guard spokesman, confirmed that the Bergdahls participated in video conferences quarterly, or as many as 20 times, over the five-year period. \"Mr. and Mrs. Bergdahl were regularly informed about what was happening throughout the duration using video teleconferencing [with] various military and other government agencies,\" Col. Marsano said. \"There was a great effort to keep Mr. and Mrs. Bergdahl updated on developments.\"\n\nThe Bergdahls did not have access to a specific Army post. The Guard offered to help the Bergdahls with media relations, and they accepted, said Col. Marsano, who has served as the family's spokesman.\n\nWhen asked about the video conferences, Navy Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said, \"While I don't have specific details to provide, I can tell you that we actively communicated with the Bergdahl family on a regular basis through a variety of means to keep them informed on the efforts to recover Sgt. Bergdahl and to highlight the close coordination and teamwork between U.S. Central Command, the Department of Defense, and other U.S. government agencies.\"\n\nRobert Bergdahl has expressed sympathy for the al Qaeda and Taliban captives at Guantanamo, as he has for other prisoners, both Christian and Muslim, around the world. Before his son's release, he tweeted, \"I am still working to free all Guantanamo prisoners. God will repay for the death of every Afghan child, ameen!\" That message on Twitter was later deleted.\n\nIn 2011, he issued a personal video urging the Pakistani military to secure his son's release. \"Strangely to some, we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years,\" Mr. Bergdahl said, addressing the Haqqanis. \"We know our son is a prisoner and, at the same time, a guest in your home.\"\n\nLarry Johnson, who worked on the issue of the American hostages in Lebanon while at the State Department in the 1980s, said he had never heard of bringing families into top-level discussions about efforts to free their relatives. \"It's wrong,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"The Bergdahls shouldn't have been part of that for no other reason than on the off chance they may inadvertently divulge some tactic.\"\n\nAsked whether the Bergdahls exposed any sensitive information, Col. Marsano said, \"I certainly don't know of anything like that happening.\" He declined to discuss whether classified matters arose or whether the couple had a security clearance.\n\n\"It was very clear to me that the agencies involved, to include the Department of Defense, had a strong interest in ensuring this family had up-to-date information and did not leave them in the dark,\" Col. Marsano said.\n\nSgt. Bergdahl is currently undergoing the military's reintegration process, which at some point includes debriefings on his captivity. Former Army colleagues accuse Sgt. Bergdahl of desertion, saying he walked off their forward operating base in Paktia province and into the hands of the enemy.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Divided Over Budget Negotiations as Ted Cruz Leads Conservative Faction\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans are currently embroiled in a contentious internal dispute over budget negotiations, with a rift emerging between the old and new guard, the mainstream and the tea party, and Senators John McCain and Ted Cruz at the forefront. This public discord is a departure from the party's usual practice of keeping disagreements behind closed doors while criticizing Democrats on various issues, such as taxes and healthcare.\n\nSenator Cruz, along with a group of Senate conservatives, is refusing to engage in budget negotiations with the House, instead engaging in open conflict with more senior Republicans like McCain who are perplexed by their hardline tactics. This conflict has given Cruz a new platform as he seeks to establish himself as a conservative instigator, but it has also left the Texas Republican increasingly isolated from many of his colleagues.\n\nThe unusual public squabbling has placed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in a precarious position, as he must decide between the conservative firebrands who hold significant influence from the right and could potentially run for president in 2016, and ending the intraparty feud that is causing an unwelcome distraction for the party. This situation recalls the tea party versus establishment fights that have disrupted Senate primaries in recent years, but this time, the battles are unfolding on the Senate floor.\n\nGOP leaders are currently observing the situation, unsure of how it will resolve itself. At present, it appears that more Republicans favor initiating conference talks rather than blocking them, although the voices in favor of the latter may be more vocal.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican and Cruz's Texas colleague, stated, \"I'm just watching,\" even as Cornyn supports beginning conference talks.\n\nCruz is not alone in this fight, which he describes as an effort to prevent a debt limit increase from being included in the budget talks. He has been spearheading the charge alongside fellow tea party Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, and Rand Paul of Kentucky. This struggle also serves as a sign of how 2016 primary politics are shaping the Senate, with Rubio, Cruz, and Paul all seen as potential presidential candidates.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cruz took the fight to his own party, stating that he does not even \"trust\" Republicans to resolve the country's fiscal problems or avoid increasing the debt ceiling. On Thursday, he portrayed the conference proceedings as a ruse to increase the ceiling by a simple majority instead of the 60 votes usually required.\n\nThe controversy began after Senate Democrats passed a budget in March, their first such plan in four years. Afterward, Democrats sought to begin conference negotiations with House Republicans, who passed their own budget under the leadership of Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). A conference is part of the regular order that the GOP has long demanded. However, Senate conservatives objected to Majority Leader Harry Reid's attempt to initiate the proceedings, demanding written assurances to exclude tax hikes and a debt limit increase from the negotiations.",
    " Title: Obama and Top Democrats Push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform in House\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama and top Democrats on Capitol Hill have reportedly shifted their focus towards the Republican-controlled House passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill, rather than a piecemeal approach, as lawmakers prepare for the Christmas holiday break.\n\nDuring a year-end press conference on Friday, President Obama urged the House to support the bipartisan immigration bill the Senate passed in the summer, a departure from his previous comments suggesting he was content with the House's apparent step-by-step plan.\n\n\"The Senate bill has the main components of comprehensive immigration reform that would boost our economy, give us an opportunity to attract more investment and high-skilled workers who are doing great things in places like Silicon Valley and around the country,\" Obama said. \"So let's go ahead and get that done.\"\n\nIn contrast to his remarks in November, where he expressed no issue with House leaders dividing the immigration bill into multiple pieces, Obama stated, \"As long as all five pieces get done, I don't care what it looks like.\" He added, \"What we do not want to do is simply carve out one piece of it...but leave behind some of the tougher stuff that still needs to get done.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has consistently stated he will not schedule a vote on the Senate bill nor negotiate with Senate Democrats on the upper chamber's legislation. \"We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill,\" Boehner said last month.\n\nAlthough the House has yet to vote on any part of an immigration bill, the chamber appears to prioritize securing the U.S.-Mexico border and not including a path to citizenship for some of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested this weekend that Boehner may negotiate on comprehensive reform next year. Boehner has expressed a willingness to pass reform, but he reportedly wants to wait until after the congressional primaries this spring and summer.\n\nReid also suggested that House members facing reelection in Democratic-leaning or middle-of-the-road districts might need to vote for immigration reform. However, any effort to pass a bill perceived by conservatives as too lenient on legalization and insufficient on border security is likely to face strong opposition from some outspoken Republican Party members, including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Iowa Rep. Steve King, and South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.\n\nEven Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party-backed lawmaker who co-sponsored the bill, now appears to favor a more piecemeal approach, with a spokesman stating in the fall, \"The most realistic way to make progress on immigration would be through a series of individual bills.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Focus on State-Level Races to Rebuild Party in 2018 and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is looking to state-level races as a means to rebuild and rebrand in the coming years. With 38 governorships up for election in the next two years, Democrats see an opportunity to introduce new faces and ideas to the political landscape.\n\nThirty-eight governorships will be contested in the next two years, providing fertile ground for new Democratic leaders to emerge. In 16 states, including swing states such as Ohio, Florida, Nevada, and Michigan, Republican governors will step down due to term limits or retirement, leaving open-seat races. New Mexico, Maine, and New Jersey, all blue states with Republican governors, will also be electing new chief executives in the next two years.\n\nWinning a number of governorships could bring a new generation of party leaders into the spotlight and help rebrand the Democratic Party. Governors can operate autonomously from Washington and pursue new policy ideas that bolster a party image of innovation.\n\n\"In governors, people see a leader. They can pursue fresh policies that spread quickly around the country,\" says Jared Leopold, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association (DGA). \"There is a lot of opportunity to be on the offense here [in 2018]...Governors quickly become the stars of their party.\"\n\nMany of America's recent presidents, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, served first as governors. After the 2008 election, Republicans found themselves in a similar position to the Democrats now, with Barack Obama winning the presidency and Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress. However, within the next two years, conservatives took 11 governorships out of Democratic hands. This year, Republicans won the presidency as well as majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n\"Republicans rebuilt after 2008 by electing new governors who pushed policies and had a story to tell,\" says Mr. Leopold. \"Governorships are the best way to quickly rebuild and inject fresh blood.\"\n\nRepublican governors elected to their first term in 2010 made a name for themselves in the conservative field. Ohio Gov. John Kasich took his state from a $6 billion deficit to a $2 billion surplus. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reached an approval rating of 77 percent after helping his state through superstorm Sandy, before his reputation was tainted by the Bridgegate scandal. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker cut his state's unemployment rate by almost half \u2013 though that largely mirrored national trends.\n\nGovernorships are the perfect means to audition a new party message, says Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who chairs the DGA. This could be especially helpful in the Midwest, where many Democrats worry the Republican Party has found a new stronghold with the white working class.\n\n\"Gubernatorial campaigns by their very nature take that one on,\" Governor Malloy told Politico. \"If you're running for governor, you are going to get known and visit every community. It's very personal ownership and people want to know you. That doesn't mean there won't be close elections, but it's different.\"\n\nGovernors Kasich, Christie, and Walker's successes also served the conservative cause in a more obvious way: They added to the party's list of credible presidential candidates in 2016.\n\n\"The Democratic Party needs some stars, some younger faces to advance their issues and to be potential national candidates in 2020 and beyond,\" says John Weingart, director of Rutgers University's Center on the American Governor in New Jersey.\n\nDuring Mr. Obama's tenure, Democrats have not only lost 12 governorships, dropping from 28 in January 2009 to 16 in January 2017; they have also lost more than 950 state legislative seats to Republicans since Obama took office, the largest net loss for either party since World War II.\n\n\"Obama paid no attention to party development as president and the results have been disastrous,\" says William Crotty, an emeritus professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston. \"His record in this regard is terrible.\"\n\nThe number of Democratic governors and state legislators over the next few years may be more important than ever. When the next census is held in 2020, state legislatures \u2013 and to some extent governors \u2013 will lead the subsequent redrawing of congressional districts. Success for Democrats at the state level is \"essential,\" adds Mr. Weingart.\n\nHowever, for Democrats to reap the rewards of state-level wins at the national level, party donors and voters need to invest in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\"The trouble is that very few people find state politics compelling, and I'll admit I'm no exception,\" writes The Week's Paul Waldman. \"It can be hard to care about what happens at the minor league ballpark when the World Series is going on...But it's necessary.\"",
    " Title: Trump's State of the Union Address: A Look at the U.S. Economy under His Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring his State of the Union address last week, President Donald Trump highlighted the strength of the U.S. economy, stating, \"I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been.\" While the accuracy of such a bold statement may be debated, there is no denying that the economy, by certain metrics, is indeed booming.\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently experiencing the longest expansion in American history, having recovered from the worst days of the Great Recession. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and the stock market has reached record levels.\n\nThe strong economy may be one of the most potent arguments Trump has as he campaigns for a second term. Historically, voters tend to reward incumbent presidents for a strong economy and punish them for a weak one. The last two presidents to lose reelection, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, were defeated during periods of a flagging economy.\n\nTrump's supporters attribute the economic highs the U.S. has reached since he took office to his policies, particularly his trillion-dollar tax cut and trade battles with China, Mexico, and others. They argue that these policies have boosted investment and created jobs in the U.S.\n\nTrump's detractors, however, claim that the gains made in the past three years are merely an extension of the progress made by former President Barack Obama. They argue that Obama prevented another depression and built a solid foundation on which the current economic expansion has grown. Some also contend that Trump's policies, such as tax cuts and increased spending, will ultimately destabilize the economy by creating a short burst of growth that will lead to another recession.\n\nAnother group asserts that the economy is not doing as well as it may seem, with most of the gains experienced by the wealthy while the working class has fallen further behind.\n\nThough the economy is still growing, the rate of that growth slowed last year to the lowest levels in the Trump presidency. Whether this is a sign that the economic upswing is reaching its peak is unclear, economists say. Economies can't grow forever, and another recession will come eventually.\n\nOpinions on the Trump administration's economic policies are divided, with some praising them for producing economic benefits for American workers and others criticizing them for exacerbating inequality and the federal deficit. The impact of Trump's policies on the economy remains a topic of ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Sparks Middle School Teacher Hailed as Hero After Confronting Shooter, Saving Students\n\nArticle:\n\nAuthorities have not disclosed the identity of the shooter who fatally wounded popular Sparks Middle School teacher Michael Landsberry and injured two students on Monday morning. Landsberry, a 45-year-old math teacher, is being remembered as a hero for his actions that saved lives by confronting the gunman and allowing students to escape the scene.\n\nAccording to Michael Mieras, Chief of the Washoe County School District, Landsberry, a former Marine and member of the Army National Guard, began his teaching career in 2001 and joined Sparks Middle School in 2006. Landsberry was highly respected by his peers and was a popular teacher among students, coaching the boys' basketball and girls' volleyball teams.\n\nDuring a Tuesday afternoon press conference, Mieras described Landsberry's actions, stating that he \"calmly walked toward the shooter\" and \"put his hands up in a motion to stop [the shooter's] actions.\" Landsberry's actions are credited with preventing further students from being shot.\n\nThe identity of the shooter, who took his own life after shooting Landsberry and two students, has not been released. One student was shot in the shoulder, while the other was struck in the abdomen. Law enforcement did not fire any shots during the incident.\n\nThe motive for the Sparks Middle School shooting remains unclear as of Tuesday afternoon. A law enforcement figure stated during the news conference, \"The answer is we don't know why right now, but we're proactively trying to determine why.\"\n\nA Facebook page, \"Remembering Mr. Michael Landsberry,\" has been created to honor the slain teacher. Tributes pour in, with one post reading, \"I Just want everyone to know how A.W.E.S.O.M.E and brave this man was... He is a true H.E.R.O in my book and always will be!\" Another post reads, \"Parents sometimes forget what we as teachers are willing to do for their children. Mr. Landsberry is a true American Hero!\"\n\nThe community mourns the loss of Landsberry and prays for the recovery of the injured students and their families.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Tweet on Kavanaugh's Birth Control Remark Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, generating attention often requires provoking opposition, as demonstrated by Hillary Clinton's tweet regarding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's characterization of birth-control pills as \"abortion-inducing drugs\" during his confirmation hearings. Clinton's statement, made on September 12, 2018, sparked controversy and was later debunked by fact-checkers.\n\nClinton's tweet, which drew criticism for its inaccuracy, stated that Kavanaugh deliberately distorted \"basic science\" and offered a \"dog whistle to the extreme right.\" This claim was widely debunked when California Senator Kamala Harris attempted to peddle it with a deceptively edited video.\n\nFact-checkers, such as The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler and PolitiFact, ruled that the characterization was dishonest. Kessler awarded four Pinocchios, the worst rating, to the claim, stating that Kavanaugh was quoting the views of specific plaintiffs in a specific case, Priests for Life v. HHS, rather than offering a personal view.\n\nThe timing of Clinton's tweet has raised questions about her motives. Some speculate that Clinton deliberately lied to pander to her base and further unfairly demonize Kavanaugh, while others suggest that she may not have been paying attention, and her staff was incompetent. However, it is also possible that Clinton's tweet was an example of a broader phenomenon in which people define themselves by what they hate, and what motivates them the most isn't support for their side's policies but their hatred of the opposing party.\n\nThis dynamic, in which people are motivated by their opposition to others rather than support for their own side, is a dominant feature of the current political climate. It is not limited to presidential candidates but saturates both parties and both sides of the culture war. This dynamic can distort how people process basic facts, as demonstrated by a report from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which found that people will misinterpret objective data if there is any hint that the data came from a Republican or Democratic source.\n\nIn a media climate where every news outlet caters to a relatively small niche audience, one of the best ways to gain attention and support is to be attacked by the opposition. This phenomenon, often referred to as \"trolling,\" is a lucrative vocation in which individuals say or do something awful to provoke the opposition, resulting in their own side rallying to their support.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska discussed this phenomenon on the Remnant podcast, stating that cable-news producers and magazine editors prioritize a deep and sticky 1% audience, and one of the most effective ways to achieve this is by being attacked, as it draws visibility to oneself. Sasse pointed to The New Yorker's \"expos\u00e9\" of Chick-fil-A's \"creepy infiltration\" of New York City as an example of this phenomenon.\n\nIn conclusion, Hillary Clinton's tweet about Brett Kavanaugh's characterization of birth-control pills as \"abortion-inducing drugs\" was widely debunked by fact-checkers. The timing and content of the tweet have raised questions about Clinton's motives, with some speculating that she deliberately lied to pander to her base and further unfairly demonize Kavanaugh. However, the broader phenomenon of people defining themselves by what they hate and the role of trolling in the current media landscape may provide additional context for Clinton's tweet.",
    " Title: House Republicans Unveil Government Spending Bill, Aiming to Avoid Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, CNN - House Republicans unveiled a government spending bill on Monday that aims to keep federal agencies funded through September and avoid a potential government shutdown. The bill, which was drafted by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Kentucky), lessens the impact of forced spending cuts for the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs, while maintaining funding for FBI and border security, embassy security, federal prisons, and weather satellite launches.\n\nThe bill, known as a \"continuing resolution\" or \"CR,\" keeps federal agencies at last year's spending levels, but factors in reductions from the forced spending cuts, known as \"sequester.\" As a result, the actual level of federal spending will drop below a trillion dollars, to $982 billion.\n\nThe bill prioritizes defense programs and allows the Pentagon some leeway to manage its funding. For instance, it cuts roughly $10 billion from procurement and other areas to beef up the Defense Department's \"operations and maintenance\" account to ensure funding for military readiness and training programs.\n\nIn addition to defense programs, the bill protects some other agencies from across-the-board budget cuts that took effect on Friday. It maintains FBI and border security staffing at current levels and increases funding for embassy security by $2 billion in response to the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last September.\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Maryland), who chairs the Appropriations Committee, has stated her priorities for the bill, which include housing, education, health care, transportation, and infrastructure projects.\n\nDemocrats are expected to try to amend the House bill to soften the impact of the spending cuts on some domestic programs. The final outcome of these amendments and the overall bill's passage remains uncertain.\n\nBefore the legislation was released, the White House declined to say whether it would support the House GOP bill, citing a desire for a practical, nonpolitical, and consistent bill with the levels established in the 2011 debt deal, known as the Budget Control Act.\n\nThe House is expected to begin debate on the spending bill on Wednesday and vote on it on Thursday. The bill's future in the Senate and the potential for amendments remain unclear.",
    " Title: \"Analysis of the \"Tax the Rich\" Movement and Its Claims\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA movement known as the \"Tax the Rich\" has gained traction, with the slogan being a central theme in discussions surrounding wealth distribution and tax policy. The movement is spearheaded by a group called Patriotic Millionaires, as evidenced by the \"Tax the Rich! Save America\" conference they hosted in 2017.\n\nThe movement's mission statement suggests that the rich should pay more taxes to save America, but the claim that the rich do not currently pay taxes is misleading. According to the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income-tax revenue in 2016, a share greater than the bottom 90 percent combined. The top half of taxpayers paid 97 percent of income taxes.\n\nThe movement's call for the rich to \"pay their fair share\" is a more debatable claim, as the definition of \"fair\" can be subjective. However, it is not preposterous to argue that the rich should pay a few percentage points more in income tax in the name of fairness. Conversely, it is also not preposterous to say that when the top 1 percent of taxpayers provide more than a third of income-tax revenue, they are already paying their fair share.\n\nAnother common argument for increasing taxes on the wealthy is the notion that the rich do not deserve their wealth or that it should be redistributed. This argument has been made by various political figures and pundits, including Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, and Bernie Sanders, as well as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. However, experts argue that even confiscating all the wealth of the entire 1 percent would not be sufficient to fund proposed policies like Medicare for All, which has an estimated price tag of $32 trillion.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Tax the Rich\" movement's claims should be approached with caution. While it is true that the rich do pay a significant portion of taxes, the notion that they are not paying their fair share or that their wealth is undeserved is a subjective and potentially irresponsible argument. The assumption that the wealth of the rich is the primary cause of the problems faced by ordinary Americans is also questionable, and the feasibility of using wealth redistribution to fund large-scale policies is debatable.",
    " Title: The Rise of the Imperial Presidency: A Conservative Perspective on the Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn November 2010, the Obama administration faced a Republican-majority House following a wave of discontent with President Obama's policies. Instead of adjusting course, the article argues that President Obama chose to bypass the elected representatives and pursue an \"imperial presidency.\"\n\nThe article cites several instances of executive overreach, including the president's decision to cease enforcing federal immigration policies, his refusal to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, and his authorization of military action in Libya without congressional approval.\n\nThe article also points to the president's use of recess appointments and his exchange with then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as examples of his alleged disregard for the Constitution and the balance of powers. The author argues that these actions demonstrate President Obama's willingness to flout established laws for political gain and convenience, and his proclivity for placing himself and his political objectives ahead of the people, the Constitution, and the nation's security.\n\nThe article concludes by urging voters to unite in defense of limited government and executive restraint, and to put an end to the \"era of the imperial presidency.\" The author suggests that the American people should demand answers from the president regarding his intentions on missile defense with Russia.",
    " Title: Special Counsel Investigates 2016 Meeting Between Flynn and Rohrabacher\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is questioning witnesses about a September 2016 meeting between former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, in connection with his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. According to NBC News, the meeting took place in Washington on Sept. 20, 2016, and involved several of Flynn's business associates from the Flynn Intel Group, a private security firm.\n\nRohrabacher, a veteran Republican congressman who advocates for friendlier ties with Russia, is also under scrutiny as the special counsel reviews emails exchanged between Flynn associates and the congressman's staff. It is unclear why Mueller is focusing on this meeting, but Rohrabacher has longstanding ties to the Kremlin and WikiLeaks, which U.S. defense officials have described as a hostile intelligence agency. He has also had contact with Rinat Akhmetshin, one of the Russia-aligned lobbyists present at Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with Russian political operatives at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that Rohrabacher attempted to broker a deal between Julian Assange and the Department of Justice, under which Assange would surrender data exonerating Russia of involvement in the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee. Rohrabacher met with Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in August. Federal prosecutors have not indicted Assange for any crimes, but the Justice Department has long sought to bring a case against him for his role in facilitating the release of hundreds of thousands of sensitive intelligence documents via Chelsea Manning.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California joked last year that Rohrabacher's frequent apologies for Russian President Vladimir Putin create the impression that the congressman is on Putin's payroll. \"There's two people I think Putin pays \u2014 Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God,\" he said.\n\nFlynn served as President Donald Trump's national security advisor for less than one month before he resigned in disgrace for lying to administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian government during the transition. His extensive and undisclosed ties to the Erdogan government in Turkey are expected to prompt an indictment in the coming weeks.\n\nThe congressman's office did not return a request for comment by press time.",
    " Title: Online Grocery Shopping: A Potential Seismic Shift Amidst the Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing pandemic has led to a significant change in consumer habits, particularly in the grocery sector. With dining out restricted due to lockdowns, consumers are still required to eat, leading to a surge in online grocery shopping, both delivery and pickup. This method of shopping is cheaper, reduces the number of trips food workers have to make, and keeps shoppers out of stores, where personnel are at risk of infection.\n\nBryan Leach, the CEO of the digital-shopping-promotions company Ibotta, predicts that online grocery shopping will rise from 3% to double-digits as a result of the pandemic. This shift could see the majority of food shopping continue to occur in physical stores, but the way people approach food shopping may change.\n\nLeach suggests that this change could lead to better remuneration for grocery workers and a shift towards embracing smaller, local supermarkets. Online grocery shoppers might be viewed as the small shopkeepers of the turn of the century, or the community-supported agriculture services that deliver fresh, local goods at small scales today.\n\nThis shift towards smaller-scale, more attentive grocery service has already begun, with the rise of specific market shops like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, and the resurgence of small butcher shops. This trend is partly driven by increased urban densification and the growing popularity of buying non-perishable consumer packaged goods online. If online grocery can supply the basics, this could be a boon for Main Street-style local shopping.",
    " Title: Former Governor Mark Sanford Wins House Seat After Political Scandals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising political comeback, former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford has won the special election for the 1st Congressional District, a seat he previously held. Sanford, who was once embroiled in a well-publicized extra-marital affair and ethics violations, overcame these scandals to secure a victory over Democratic opponent Elizabeth Colbert Busch.\n\nFrom the start of his bid for Congress, Sanford was open about the affair and made it the subject of his first TV ad. He asked for, and received, political redemption from the voters.\n\n\"I want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances but third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth chances, because that is the reality of our shared humanity,\" said Sanford at his victory celebration Tuesday night. \"I am one imperfect man saved by God's grace.\"\n\nElizabeth Colbert Busch's campaign, as well as two national Democratic groups, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch confronted Sanford about his 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress. Her campaign also ran a TV commercial that criticized Sanford for using \"tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character.\"\n\nFor all his political baggage, Mark Sanford is a veteran on the campaign trail. Elizabeth Colbert Busch showed her campaign inexperience at times.\n\n\"Sanford may be a flawed candidate but he's a fabulous campaigner,\" said Republican strategist Hogan Gidley, a former executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party. \"Forget the rhetoric or the policy or the delivery -- hand-to-hand, eye-to-eye he's very good and it's impossible to outwork him.\"\n\nSanford also seemed to win this election one voter at a time. He appeared to be everywhere in the campaign's closing days, holding nearly 15 events on Monday and another 10 on Election Day.\n\nThe 1st Congressional District is traditionally Republican, with Mitt Romney carrying the district by 18 percentage points in the 2012 presidential election. Even with a candidate with serious political baggage like Sanford, he was able to win.\n\nSanford won all five counties in the district, including his home base of Charleston County, where the most voters were at stake. Colbert Busch's campaign outspent Sanford's operation in the closing weeks, but money matters in campaign politics, and it's just one factor in determining a race.",
    " Title: White House Faces Internal Debate Over Timing of Immigration Announcement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is currently grappling with a contentious internal debate regarding the timing of President Barack Obama's anticipated announcement on immigration policy. Chris Newman, the legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, has urged the president to act swiftly, expressing hope that Obama's conscience will guide his decision.\n\nRepresentative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, a Democrat from Illinois, has criticized the administration's approach in the past. He stated that any delay in the announcement comes at a significant cost, including families being separated and children being placed in foster care. Guti\u00e9rrez expressed confidence that the president will prioritize families and security over short-term political maneuvers.\n\nWithin the White House, the timing of the announcement has become a subject of intense discussion, even as immigration lawyers at the Department of Homeland Security work to develop legally defensible policy options for the president. Some advisers to the president are advocating for a delay, concerned about the potential political backlash from a broad action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and to provide many of them with official work papers.\n\nThe concern is that such a move could ignite a heated conflict with Republicans and potentially harm Democratic Senate candidates running in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, and potentially Iowa. Control of the Senate hinges on the outcomes of several close races in states where Obama is not popular, particularly in Southern states where opposition to an immigration overhaul is high. Strategists fear that an immigration announcement could negatively impact Democratic candidates.\n\nDemocratic senators have reached out to top White House officials, including Denis McDonough, the chief of staff, to argue that the recent crisis with unaccompanied minors crossing the border into the United States justifies a delay. Several Democratic officials on Capitol Hill stated that the angry reaction to that border crisis has eroded public support for changing immigration policy, and in some cases, turned the issue into a liability for them.\n\nHowever, others within the White House are advocating for the president to adhere to his promised schedule, regardless of the immediate political consequences. They argue that Republicans will criticize the president and attack Democratic candidates even if Obama delays parts of his announcement until after the election.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Decision Not to Indict Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson Does Not End Legal Troubles\n\n Article:\n\n FERGUSON, Mo. \u2014 The grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown will not end Wilson's legal troubles. Although the decision is likely the last word from Missouri's criminal courts, Wilson, whose shooting of Brown on Aug. 9 sparked months of protests, could face civil rights charges brought by the Department of Justice or a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by Brown's parents.\n\n The federal inquiry into the incident, led by Attorney General Eric Holder, remains ongoing. Wilson could have been charged with first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter. The exact circumstances surrounding Brown's death in the shooting are still in dispute. Police say Brown, who was unarmed, struggled with Wilson inside his police car before reaching for Wilson's weapon. Brown's family and some witnesses say Wilson killed Brown as he raised his hands in surrender.\n\n Police officers rarely face indictment for on-the-job shootings. In 2011, police killed 404 people in the line of duty, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. In 2012, officers killed 410, and in 2013, the number grew to 461\u2014the most in two decades. The FBI data do not include any information on criminal charges.\n\n The grand jury, which convened on Aug. 20, did not weigh whether Wilson had a justifiable reason to shoot Brown. \"They did not find probable cause to believe a crime was committed and Darren Wilson committed it,\" said Susan McGraugh, a criminal defense lawyer and a professor at the St. Louis University School of Law. \"They do not have to explain their reasoning, and they won't. They simply have a form and sign something that says 'no true bill.'\"\n\n \"They are not making a decision on Officer Wilson's guilt,\" said Peter Joy, a criminal defense attorney and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law.\n\n Wilson has been on paid leave from the department since the incident. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told MSNBC that Missouri law would allow Wilson to return to the force if he is cleared of any charges. The Police Department would conduct an internal review of the Brown shooting to see whether Wilson violated any policies.\n\n Brown's family could sue Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department for excessive force and wrongful death, said James Cohen, a professor at Fordham University Law School. In a civil trial, Brown's family could seek monetary damages, as the victim's family did in the case of football player O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted in a criminal trial of his wife's murder but ordered by a court in a civil trial to pay millions to her family.\n\n The federal government's probe could have wide-ranging consequences not only for Wilson but also for the entire Police Department. \"Their claims would not just be excessive force, which would be directly associated with the police officer, but failure to adequately train the police officer,\" Cohen said. \"Then, you sort of implicate the whole department and its structure.\"\n\n More unlikely, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney could take a crack at Wilson. The grand jury's decision would not preclude a prosecutor from bringing new evidence to another grand jury or bypassing the grand jury entirely by filing a criminal complaint, McGraugh said.\n\n Wilson may never escape public infamy, but he will not have a criminal arrest record, McGraugh said. Since St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch did not bring a criminal complaint against Wilson and he was never charged, arraigned, or arrested, she said. McCulloch also took the unusual step of presenting both incriminating and exculpatory evidence, she said.\n\n The court's treatment of Wilson's case may affect how prosecutors handle future cases, including whether evidence that does not support an indictment may be presented. \"I think we will see a call for a real wholesale review of how the criminal justice system functions,\" McGraugh said. \"People want to be heard in terms of a lot of the systemic injustices in the criminal justice system.\"",

However, political scientist Eric Patashnik's book \"Reforms at Risk\" warns that the survival of the ACA is not guaranteed, and its success depends on its ability to endure over time and build strong political support.\n\nCongressional Republicans have vowed to continue attacking the ACA's funding and have expressed intentions to repeal the law if they gain control of the White House or Congress. House Speaker John Boehner and presidential candidate Mitt Romney have both publicly stated their support for repeal.\n\nIn addition to political challenges, there are practical hurdles in implementing and enforcing the ACA. Questions remain about how penalties will be enforced on those who refuse to purchase insurance, the effectiveness of cost controls, and the quality of insurance choices offered through state-run health care exchanges. Some state officials have announced plans to delay implementing the law until after the November elections, potentially leading to federal intervention.\n\nHistorically, well-regarded federal programs like Social Security and Medicare faced similar challenges during their early stages. Social Security, for example, faced a freeze on taxes during World War II and concerns about its survival due to the popularity of other programs for the elderly. However, Congress made adjustments to the program, expanding coverage and revising the tax system, ultimately leading to its success.\n\nSimilarly, the Supreme Court's 1936 decision to strike down an agricultural-processing tax supporting a farm subsidy program led to Congress reworking the program, resolving constitutional issues and protecting farmers.\n\nIn light of these historical precedents, the ACA's success will depend on Congress's ability to refine and improve the law to ensure its effectiveness. The 2012 election could prove to be a more significant moment for health care reform than the Supreme Court decision, as the outcome could determine the law's long-term viability. If Democrats fail to make the ACA work well, a future Congress may use its power to repeal the legislation and finish what the Supreme Court did not accomplish.",
    " Title: Comparison of Nixon's \"Enemies List\" and Woodward Email Incident Unfounded, Historical Inaccuracies Abound\n\nArticle:\n\nA comparison by Matt Drudge between the firestorm over an email sent by a White House aide to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and the Nixon White House's \"Enemies List\" has been deemed absurd and ahistorical. The Nixon White House's \"Enemies List\" was a plan to use the power of the federal government to financially damage political opponents, including journalists.\n\nThe \"Enemies List\" was a 1971 memorandum from White House Counsel John Dean to White House Chief of Staff John Haldeman's assistant, titled \"Dealing with our political enemies.\" The memo outlined a plan to use federal machinery to damage political opponents, including grant availability, federal contracts, and litigation prosecution.\n\nFurthermore, the actions of Nixon administration and campaign official G. Gordon Liddy were far more sinister than a mere email. Liddy served four and a half years in prison for his role in the Watergate break-in and the break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg, the military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers. Liddy has acknowledged preparing to kill someone during the Ellsberg break-in, plotting to murder journalist Jack Anderson, plotting with a \"gangland figure\" to murder Howard Hunt, plotting to firebomb the Brookings Institution, and plotting to kidnap \"leftist guerillas\" at the 1972 Republican National Convention.\n\nIn contrast, Woodward received an email from White House economic adviser Gene Sperling in which the aide stated, \"I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying saying that [President Obama] asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim.\" Woodward replied to that email, \"I also welcome your personal advice. I am listening.\"\n\nThe comparison between the two incidents is unfounded, as the Nixon White House's actions were far more severe and involved direct threats and plots to harm opponents, while the email sent to Woodward was a personal appeal to reconsider a comment.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce STEM Jobs Act Amendment to Address Family-Based Green Card Backlog\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans, following their poor showing among Hispanics in the U.S. presidential election, are set to vote on immigration legislation next week that aims to expand visas for foreign science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and make it easier for those with green cards to bring their immediate families to the U.S.\n\nThe legislation, known as the STEM Jobs Act, is being viewed as a potential first step in overhauling the nation's dysfunctional immigration system, a top priority for Hispanic communities. The House previously voted on a STEM bill in September, but it was defeated due to a two-thirds majority requirement and opposition from more than 80 percent of Democrats, who objected to the bill's offsetting increase in visas for high-tech graduates by eliminating another visa program for less-educated foreigners.\n\nThis time, Republicans are changing the formula by adding a provision to expand a program that allows the spouses and minor children of people with permanent residence, or green cards, to wait in the United States for their own green cards to be granted. Currently, there are about 322,000 spouses, wives, and children waiting in this category, with an average wait time of more than two years.\n\nUnder the new proposal, family members would be allowed to come to the U.S. one year after they apply for their green cards, but they would not be able to work until they actually receive the card. The bill applies to the families of green card holders who marry after getting their residency permits.\n\nBruce Morrison, a former Democratic congressman who chaired the House immigration subcommittee and authored a 1990 immigration law, described the bill as neither increasing the number of green cards nor granting green cards early. However, he noted that the bill provides the \"most important benefit\" of allowing family members to live legally in the United States with their spouses.\n\nMorrison, an immigration policy lobbyist who advocates for groups such as American Families United, called the bill a stepping-stone to more comprehensive immigration reform. He viewed the Republicans' initiation of the bill as a positive gesture that they want to engage in discussions about this subject.\n\nMegan Whittemore, spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a key proponent of the STEM Act, described the bill as \"family friendly,\" helping spouses and minor children who would otherwise be separated from their families for extended periods of time.\n\nThe bill will be taken up this time under normal procedures requiring only a majority vote, and it is almost certain to pass the Republican-led House. However, it remains to be seen whether it will garner enough Democratic support to gain momentum as it heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nThe bill would grant 55,000 green cards a year to doctoral and masters graduates in the STEM fields. The measure, strongly backed by U.S. high-tech companies, would make it easier for people trained in the United States to put their skills to work for American companies rather than non-American competitors.\n\nHowever, the legislation would still eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which gives out a similar 55,000 green cards a year to those from countries, including many in Africa, with traditionally low rates of immigration to the U.S. This prompted the House's Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus to all come out against it in September.\n\nThe three caucuses argued that Republicans were trying to increase legal immigration for people they want by ending immigration for people they do not want. Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, described the bill as a message from Republicans that \"we are here and we are ready to talk about immigration reform.\"\n\nHowever, Williams expressed doubt that the bill will make much progress in the Senate during the short lame-duck session. She noted that people \"are now starting to think about broader reform,\" adding that a limited bill that does not increase visas will not receive a lot of support.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Suspends 2020 Presidential Campaign, Clearing Path for Biden-Trump Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a livestreamed speech from his hometown of Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders announced the suspension of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. The departure of Sanders leaves former Vice President Joe Biden as the last remaining candidate in the Democratic race, setting up a long battle for the White House between Biden and incumbent Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nSanders, who promised to lead a grassroots political revolution into the White House, acknowledged he no longer had a path to victory after a string of decisive nominating contest losses to Biden. The independent U.S. senator from Vermont cited the coronavirus outbreak, which has taken him off the campaign trail and limited his ability to get his message out, as a reason for his decision.\n\n\"I can not in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that can not win, and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders, 78, called it a \"difficult and painful decision\" but said he would stay on the ballot in future primaries and continue to gather delegates in order to push the Democratic platform toward his populist anti-corporate agenda, including a government-run healthcare system and tax hikes for the rich.\n\nThe departure of Sanders sets up a long battle for the White House between Biden, 77, and Trump, 73, who is seeking a second four-year term in office. That matchup for the foreseeable future will revolve around Trump's handling of the public health crisis that has upended all aspects of American life and rocked the country's economy.\n\nRelated Coverage:\n- Factbox: Biden is the last person standing in the 2020 Democratic presidential race\n- Biden on Wednesday signaled he was ready for a bruising general election fight and the challenge he now faces in trying to unite the Democratic Party's liberal and moderate wings.\n- In a separate statement, Biden praised Sanders and promised his ideas would be incorporated into Biden's White House run.\n\nWinning over Sanders' most ardent supporters will not be easy. Sanders' speechwriter David Sirota said Biden should rethink his opposition to parts of Sanders' agenda that opinion polls show are popular among Democratic voters.\n\n\"Biden's campaign has to do its part to bring those voters into the fold and energize them in a real way, and they're going to have to do more than just saying Donald Trump is bad. So far Biden has not done that,\" Sirota said.\n\nDemocrats said Sanders' decision to pull out of the 2020 race now would give the party time to come together before the August nominating convention. Some Democrats blame Sanders for staying in his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton too long, hurting her general election bid against Trump.\n\n\"I think that allows more time for healing,\" said Democratic operative Joel Payne, who worked for Clinton's campaign in 2016.\n\nTrump, who has courted Sanders' supporters and said the senator was treated unfairly by the Democratic Party establishment, reacted quickly on Twitter.\n\n\"This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!,\" Trump wrote.\n\nMany of Sanders' policy positions have become part of the everyday Democratic Party debate, including his Medicare for All proposal that would create a government-run healthcare system to replace the current blend of private medical insurance and public programs. He also advocated a $15 minimum wage, tuition-free public colleges, and higher taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\"It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe. Today they are mainstream ideas, and many of them are already being implemented in cities and states across the country. That is what we have accomplished together,\" Sanders said in his announcement.",
    " Title: Romney Advocates Tying Foreign Aid to Market Opening, Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Clinton Global Initiative, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called for a reevaluation of the disbursement of American foreign aid, suggesting that it could be linked to the opening of markets and promotion of employment. Romney stated, \"The aim of a much larger share of our aid must be the promotion of work and the fostering of free enterprise.\"\n\nThis proposal is likely to ignite debate, as many labor rights organizations and American labor unions argue that free trade agreements, similar to those advocated by Romney, lead to job losses overseas.\n\nDuring the event, Romney shared a smile with former President Bill Clinton, who has been criticizing him in swing states on behalf of President Obama. Romney jokingly commented, \"If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned this election season, it\u2019s that a few words from Bill Clinton can do a man a lot of good.\"\n\nPresident Obama, speaking at the United Nations, addressed the topic of freedom of speech and its significance in the United States. He emphasized the country's commitment to protecting the right to express offensive or hateful speech, stating, \"We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can become a tool to silence critics or oppress minorities.\"\n\nObama's speech came two weeks after violent anti-American protests resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, in Benghazi, Libya. In his address, Obama vowed to continue supporting democratic freedoms in the Muslim world and to hold accountable those responsible for the attacks.\n\nThe president devoted most of his remarks to the Arab democracy movement and its aftermath. His speech was reportedly influenced by his own thoughts after learning of the Benghazi attacks and his subsequent visit to the State Department to console grieving employees.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses Ted Cruz of Imitating His Border Wall Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview aired on Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized Texas Senator Ted Cruz for allegedly copying his call to build a wall on the Mexican border and positioning himself as a leader in the national immigration debate.\n\n\"Ted Cruz is trying to step up his whole game on amnesty and on illegal immigration because it was actually quite weak,\" Trump told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Cruz's plan is stricter on undocumented workers, Trump responded, \"Well, first of all, his plan just happened. In fact, I was watching the other day. And I was watching Ted talk. And he said, 'We will build a wall.' The first time I've ever heard him say it.\"\n\nTrump continued, \"My wife, who was sitting next to me, said, 'Oh, look. He's copying what you've been saying for a long period of time.'\"\n\nThe real estate mogul then discussed deportation, stating that people can return to the country legally and that he advocates for a \"strong border.\"\n\n\"And I'm the one that came up with it. Look. When I announced that I was running, I brought up illegal immigration. It was not even a subject that would have been discussed in this debate. And now it's one of the very big subjects,\" he said.\n\nTrump also compared Cruz's stance on immigration and amnesty to that of Florida Senator Marco Rubio, stating that both are attempting to address past weaknesses.\n\n\"So they're trying to get stronger. But, look, nobody has that position like I have that position. I want the wall. I want strong borders. I want everybody out. Now, people are coming to me. But nobody has that issue like me,\" he said.\n\n\"And nobody's going to be able to do it like me. Nobody. As an example, on the wall. Nobody is getting Mexico to pay for the wall, the cost of the wall, but me. They do not even know about that. That's not even in their vocabulary,\" Trump concluded.",
    " Title: Historical Suppression of Free Speech and Press in the United States: A Long-Standing Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, often perceived as a bastion of free speech and a free press, has a history of suppressing these liberties, particularly during times of war and in the name of national security. The First Amendment guarantees these freedoms, but attempts to restrict them have been prevalent since the country's inception.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of such attempts can be traced back to the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. Authored by Federalists such as John Adams, these acts prohibited the publication of \"false, scandalous, and malicious\" writings against the government. The acts led to the imprisonment of newspaper editors, the denial of entry to the U.S. for immigrants, and the deportation of foreigners.\n\nDuring the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, allowing individuals to be arrested and held without formal charges. Suspected political prisoners were tried before military tribunals. Lincoln's actions were criticized on constitutional grounds, as only Congress has the power to suspend habeas corpus.\n\nDuring World War I, the Sedition and Espionage Acts were enacted, forbidding the use of \"disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language\" about the government, the flag, or the military. The early 1900s saw the formation of the Bureau of Investigation (later the FBI), which was used to clamp down on civil liberties in an unprecedented manner.\n\nHistorian Jennifer Weber notes that Wilson's administration systematically pursued leftists, immigrants, and political dissidents not because of their actions but because of their political beliefs. Violators faced substantial fines and prison sentences of up to 20 years.\n\nCensorship during the 1918 flu pandemic, which resulted in 50-100 million deaths worldwide, is another example of suppressed free speech. Early reports of the flu's spread were minimized to maintain wartime morale.\n\nIn the decades that followed the First World War, the nation saw increased suppression of civil rights on a variety of fronts, with labor unions, feminists, and communists among the targeted groups.\n\nWorld War II brought us the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and McCarthyism. The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 60s was characterized by government suppression of individual rights. The Vietnam War Era was marked by anti-war protests and corresponding efforts by the government to control dissent.\n\nToday, the nation is subject to NSA spying on American citizens and the Patriot Act, which \"arms law enforcement with new tools to detect and prevent terrorism.\" One hundred years ago, a journalist writing on this topic could face imprisonment. Today, the only consequence might be attention from the NSA. Past precedents could change this yet again in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, while the United States is often celebrated for its commitment to free speech and a free press, its history reveals a persistent conflict between individual rights and national security, with numerous instances of suppression of these liberties.",
    " Title: Illinois Teen Warns Against Vaping After Suffering Severe Lung Injury\n\nArticle:\n\nAn 18-year-old from Gurnee, Illinois, Adam Hergenreder, has issued a warning to young people about the dangers of vaping after being hospitalized with a severe lung injury caused by vaping. According to the Chicago Tribune, Hergenreder has been in the hospital since Saturday at Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville, where he is currently receiving oxygen therapy.\n\nHergenreder, who started vaping at the age of 16, told the Chicago Tribune that his preferred flavors were mint and mango. He ignored warnings from teachers, parents, and health officials to stop vaping until it was nearly too late. He was rushed to the hospital after several days of uncontrolled vomiting and faces a prolonged recovery period, with the possibility of permanent lung damage due to scarring from inflammation.\n\n\"People just see that little pod and think, how could that do anything to my body?,\" Hergenreder said Tuesday from Advocate Condell Medical Center. \"I'm glad I could be an example and show people that [vaping products] aren't good at all. They will mess up your lungs.\"\n\nHergenreder initially used about one and a half Juul pods per day, he told WLS-TV. He then began vaping marijuana, purchasing devices from street dealers that can be altered or contaminated with unknown substances. This daily regimen led him to an emergency room, where a doctor ordered a scan of his stomach and saw that \"something wasn't right,\" his mother told the Tribune.\n\nHergenreder's condition has since improved thanks to oxygen therapy, steroids, and antibiotics, but he is one of at least 27 patients in Illinois who have been hospitalized in recent weeks with severe respiratory illnesses, including one who died, according to the newspaper.\n\nHealth officials in Oregon on Wednesday also announced that a second person has died from a severe lung illness linked to vaping, and the first such death connected to a vaping product purchased at a marijuana dispensary.\n\nAs of late last week, a total of 215 possible cases of severe lung disease associated with e-cigarettes have been reported by 25 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, a Juul spokesman said the company takes the health of its users seriously, labeling its products with \"ingredient disclosures\" and health warnings. The company also stated that its devices and manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous quality and certification standards, and it conducts extensive preclinical and toxicological testing of the ingredients and analytes in Juul e-liquids and aerosols.\n\nThe company is also working to stop counterfeit products compatible with its devices, which are often marketed in violation of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laws, according to the statement.\n\n\"As to this particular reported event, we do not have any details beyond what is being reported by the media, including what or whose products were actually consumed,\" the statement read. \"We will continue to vigilantly monitor for any evidence of safety issues.\"\n\nHergenreder hopes to leave the hospital in days if his condition continues to improve. However, only \"time and further pulmonary testing\" will tell if his breathing will ever return to normal in the weeks and months ahead, his doctor told the Tribune.\n\n\"I feel stupid,\" Hergenreder told the newspaper. \"I want other people to stop. It's going to attack your lungs.\"",
    " Title: California Eliminates Retroactive Tax Deduction for Qualified Small Businesses\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia has announced the elimination of a tax deduction that encouraged entrepreneurs and investors to start and maintain companies within the state. The deduction, which allowed for a 50% exclusion of any gain on the sale of Qualified Small Business (QSB) stock, has been a significant factor in keeping businesses in California instead of relocating to lower-tax states.\n\nThe state's capital gains taxes are currently at 9%, and the deduction reduced the capital gains rate to 4.5%. However, California has decided to eliminate the deduction retroactively, affecting those who sold their California companies in the past five years and took advantage of the tax deduction.\n\nEntrepreneur Brian Overstreet, who sold his company last year, wrote about this tax decision on Xconomy. As a result of the retroactive change, Overstreet, like many others, will now have to pay the tax. Overstreet argues that this decision will have far-reaching implications and may encourage companies to reconsider locating in California.\n\nOverstreet states, \"California changed the rules after the fact, and that\u2019s just not right.\" He further notes that the California Franchise Tax Board's (FTB) retroactive action will send a \"terrifying message\" that may drive young, growing businesses to more friendly environments. This decision could have significant consequences for the state's startup community, as entrepreneurs and investors face potentially debilitating tax bills in the coming months.\n\nOverstreet's company was a small, locally-focused business with a vibrant workforce. The elimination of the QSB tax deduction may impact the decision-making process for similar businesses considering California as a location. The full extent of the impact remains to be seen.",
    " Title: SolarCity Corp. Under Investigation for Potential Misuse of Federal Tax Credits\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia-based solar company SolarCity Corp., a significant recipient of federal tax credits and a company backed by high-profile Obama supporter Elon Musk, is under investigation for potential misuse of federal tax credits. The investigation, led by the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General, follows concerns raised by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nSessions' letter to the Treasury Department expressed concern that SolarCity might become the next Solyndra, a solar-panel maker that received significant federal funding but went bankrupt in 2011. SolarCity, in response, dismissed the Solyndra comparison, stating that the declining prices of solar panels, which have allowed more Americans to adopt solar energy, are the driving force behind the company's success.\n\nBeyond SolarCity reportedly received millions in tax credits and cash grants through the 2009 stimulus law, Sessions also alleges that the company may have overestimated the \"fair market value\" of its products to secure higher tax credits, potentially reaping financial benefits at the expense of American taxpayers.\n\nSolarCity officials, including Lyndon Rive, a fellow Obama donor and Musk's cousin, acknowledged in the company's initial public offering (IPO) document the continued need for government support. They stated that the expiration, elimination, or reduction of rebates, tax credits, and incentives would adversely impact their business.\n\nSolyndra, another solar-panel maker touted by Obama, received an estimated $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees before declaring bankruptcy in 2011, repaying only a projected $143 million of the funds. Though the cash-grant program for SolarCity and others has concluded, the tax-credit program could continue through 2016.\n\nSolarCity reported a third-quarter profit after years of losses in the recent past. However, Elon Musk, the company's chairman, has benefited significantly from government credits and funding through his various ventures, including a $465 million loan from the Obama administration for Tesla, which was recently paid off, and thousands in federal tax credits for Tesla.\n\nMusk, who has donated $750 toward Obama's first election effort, and Rive, who donated $1,500, are among other SolarCity investors who have supported Obama's campaigns. The investigation into SolarCity's practices is ongoing, and the company has yet to provide a detailed response to the allegations.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Adviser Richard Gates Pleads Guilty in Mueller Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Richard Gates pleaded guilty to two charges brought against him by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team in federal court in Washington, D.C. on Friday afternoon. The charges include one count of conspiracy against the United States and one count of making a false statement to the FBI agents investigating Russian interference.\n\nAs part of the plea deal, Gates has agreed to cooperate \"fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly\" with Mueller's office as well as other law enforcement officials. He is required to turn over relevant documents, attend meetings when requested, and testify when requested both before and after he is sentenced. By agreeing to \"fully cooperate,\" additional criminal charges will not be brought against him.\n\nAccording to the criminal information filed by Mueller on Friday, Gates lied to federal investigators about a March 2013 meeting during which former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, an unnamed member of Congress, and an unnamed lobbyist discussed Ukraine.\n\nMueller filed the criminal information one day after he unveiled a new superseding indictment charging Gates and Manafort with a slew of financial-related crimes stemming from their work for pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine over the past decade. The alleged crimes are unrelated to the work Manafort and Gates did for the Trump campaign.\n\nMueller accused the two longtime business associates of laundering more than $30 million dollars in income that they hid from the U.S. government.\n\nSpeculation has mounted over the past week that Gates would plead guilty and cooperate in Mueller's probe, making him a key witness who could testify in the criminal case against Manafort. The development is expected to ratchet up pressure on Manafort to cooperate in Mueller's probe.\n\nManafort, who resigned as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after reports surfaced about his work for Russian-backed Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Yanukovych, could offer key details about the campaign relevant to Mueller's broader inquiry into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with Moscow.\n\nManafort issued a statement in response to Gates's guilty plea, saying he is innocent. \"Notwithstanding that Rick Gates pled today, I continue to maintain my innocence,\" Manafort said. \"I had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\"\n\nGates served as Manafort's deputy on the campaign and went on to work for Trump's transition team. In a letter obtained by ABC News earlier Friday, Gates told friends and family that he had decided to plead guilty for the sake of his children. \"Despite my initial desire to vigorously defend myself, I have had a change of heart,\" Gates wrote. \"The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much. I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Mixed Messages on Islamic State Strategy Cause Confusion\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama sent seemingly conflicting signals Wednesday regarding the United States' ultimate goal in the fight against the Islamic State (IS), stating that the objective is to \"degrade and destroy\" the terror group, but later claiming he wants to make it a \"manageable problem.\"\n\nDuring a press conference in Europe, Obama first took a hard line, condemning the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff as \"horrific\" and \"barbaric\" and vowing \"justice will be served.\" He later clarified that if the U.S. is joined by an international coalition, they can \"continue to shrink IS's sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.\"\n\nThe remarks have caused confusion on Capitol Hill and among allies, with some lawmakers criticizing the president's \"mixed messages\" on the Islamic State. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) told Fox News that the president has not answered whether the U.S. goal is to contain or crush IS. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) also criticized the president's statements, saying \"The time to stop and destroy ISIL is now.\"\n\nThe president is in Europe this week for meetings with allies, where everything from ISIS to the crisis in Ukraine will be on the table. Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to the Middle East to try and build a stronger coalition to go after the Islamic State while boosting the Iraqi and Kurdish governments.\n\nThe Obama administration has stressed that the problems in Iraq must be addressed in large part by a new and inclusive government in Baghdad. However, the president continues to weigh whether to expand the current airstrike campaign in northern Iraq into Syria. On Wednesday, Obama still did not give a timeline for deciding on a strategy to go after the extremist group's operations in Syria.\n\nThe execution of freelance reporter Steven Sotloff, who reportedly held dual American-Israeli citizenship, was the second such killing in two weeks. In the Sotloff video, a masked militant warns that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, \"our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.\" Obama responded that he will continue to fight the militant threat and the \"barbaric and ultimately empty vision\" it represents.\n\nSotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished a year ago in Syria and was not seen again until he appeared in the video that showed Foley's beheading. In the video distributed Tuesday and titled \"A Second Message to America,\" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the Islamic State, the extremist group that has conquered wide swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq and declared itself a caliphate.",
    " Title: Democratic Establishment Confronts Unexpected Challenge from Bernie Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic party is currently grappling with the unexpected surge of Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist, in the 2016 presidential race. This development mirrors the Republican establishment's struggle to contain Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the previous year.\n\nThe political class was taken aback by the intensity of voter anger and frustration, a sentiment that was underestimated by the media, as was the case with the Trump and Sanders campaigns. The conventional wisdom at the start of 2015 predicted a strong front-runner in Jeb Bush and a lock for Hillary Clinton. However, Jeb Bush's failure to emerge from single-digit standings and Hillary Clinton's early-state strategy being second-guessed are evidence of this underestimation.\n\nBoth Clinton and Bush, hailing from political dynasties, were expected to secure their respective nominations with substantial financial backing from mega-donors. They are also 20th-century figures attempting to adapt to a new century, with Clinton having stood by her husband during the 1992 campaign and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, while Jeb Bush first ran for Florida governor in 1994 and has not held office since 2006. They are perceived as steady, serious, and somewhat dull.\n\nTrump and Sanders, who were not initially given a chance by prognosticators, have drawn larger crowds and generated more enthusiasm than their rivals. Despite their ideological differences, both candidates are running against the establishment. Sanders, an independent throughout his career, has even criticized Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, organizations that are backing Hillary Clinton, as part of the establishment.\n\nTrump, who does not rely on campaign contributions, has disrupted the rules of engagement, forcing his rivals to adopt a more aggressive stance on issues such as illegal immigration. Sanders, who has raised significantly more funds than anticipated, has compelled Clinton to shift her positions on healthcare and taxes.\n\nLiberal commentators have enjoyed the spectacle of a Republican civil war, with some prominent voices on the right predicting that the party will self-destruct by nominating Trump or Cruz, a freshman senator who has alienated the establishment. However, it is now the Democratic elders who are expressing concern about the possibility of a socialist leading their ticket and potentially damaging down-ballot candidates.\n\n\"The Republicans won't touch him [in the primaries] because they can't wait to run an ad with a hammer and sickle,\" Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Hillary Clinton supporter, told the New York Times.\n\nIn most campaigns, the insurgent candidate captures media attention but ultimately fades: Herman Cain, Rick Santorum, Howard Dean, Bill Bradley, Pat Robertson, and Gary Hart. However, 2016 is not a typical campaign year. Trump, Cruz, and Sanders have exposed the weaknesses of the establishment in both parties, as well as the media's myopia.",

Roth argued that such fiscal behavior is not in line with the Republican platform.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury Department, the government is expected to borrow $955 billion this fiscal year, with over $1 trillion in borrowing anticipated for both 2019 and 2020. This increased borrowing is contributing to recent volatility in financial markets, as investors worry that the additional fiscal stimulus, combined with a strengthening economy, could lead to higher inflation and interest rates.\n\nOn Thursday, major stock indexes experienced a significant drop, entering a market correction, or a decline of more than 10% from their peak. This decline was largely due to comments from the Bank of England suggesting it might raise interest rates sooner and to a higher degree as it addresses potential inflation. As a result, investors flocked to bonds, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill to a four-year high of 2.88%.\n\nFor many Republicans, supporting the budget agreement represents a departure from conservative fiscal orthodoxy that could pose risks in the upcoming midterm elections. The party's commitment to limited government and deficit reduction played a significant role in the Republicans regaining control of the House and Senate during the Obama administration and in President Trump's election, with the candidate promising to curb federal spending.\n\nLast May, the Trump administration released a budget projecting the U.S. would transition from a deficit of $440 billion in 2018 to a surplus of $16 billion in 2027. The budget proposed deep cuts to domestic programs and a substantial increase in military spending. The current budget agreement appears to deviate from these proposed fiscal measures.",
    " Title: Putin's Foreign Policy: A Historical Perspective on Syria Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has characterized Russia's intervention in Syria as a fight against the Islamic State. However, Putin's motivation for this intervention can be traced back to events as far as 1989, specifically the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nIn 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and crowds stormed the secret police compound in Dresden, breaking its grip on German society. A young Vladimir Putin, then an officer of the KGB, kept them from storming his headquarters. Despite his success, he felt abandoned by Moscow, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union into chaos left a lasting impact on him.\n\nPutin believes that the state's authority is the ultimate bulwark against chaos, and it must be protected, whether in Russia or beyond. He views democracy as something that can quickly dissolve into mob rule, a perspective he has expressed throughout his career.\n\nIn 2004, massive protests in Ukraine overturned the alleged victory of Viktor Yanukovych, Russia's favored candidate. This event, known as the Orange Revolution, was a significant defeat for Putin, who came to believe it was a model for plotting revolution inside Russia.\n\nIn 2011, Putin stepped down as president but continued to serve as prime minister alongside his protege, Dmitry Medvedev. Protests were sweeping through the Arab World, and Medvedev voiced his sympathy, not blocking American and NATO intervention in Libya. Putin, however, lashed out, referring to the intervention as a medieval call to crusade.\n\nThe public breach between Putin and Medvedev contributed to Putin's decision to return to the presidency. In the years that followed, Putin pursued a foreign policy much more hostile to the West, at the same time tightening laws to stifle any public protest at home.\n\nIn 2013, protests erupted yet again in Ukraine, this time over efforts to move the country closer to the European Union. Putin has expressed his opposition to such moves, stating that any citizen has a right to express their opinion about the decisions made, but this must be kept within the law.\n\nPutin has also warned that if the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice but to force things in order to prevent chaos. This perspective is reflected in Russia's intervention in Syria, where Putin supports President Bashar al-Assad, whom he views as the state, against an unruly mob.\n\nPutin has expressed concern that the West is repeating past mistakes by exporting revolutions, this time of so-called 'democratic' ones, and that chaos is the result. Putin's foreign policy, as demonstrated by his intervention in Syria, appears to be rooted in his belief that the state's authority is the ultimate bulwark against chaos.",
    " Title: New York City Mayor Criticizes Donald Trump's Remark on Gun Violence and Presidential Fitness\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has criticized Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump for his statement that support for his campaign would not diminish even if he shot someone in the middle of a crowded street.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Sioux Center, Iowa, Mr. Trump said, \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose voters.\"\n\nIn response, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, expressed his disapproval on ABC's \"This Week,\" stating, \"It's incredibly insensitive.\" He further added, \"We had a moment in our nation's history we're talking about how to deal with the scourge of gun violence. And for someone who says he wants to be president to say that, it shows he's just not presidential.\"\n\nDe Blasio also commented on Trump's perceived arrogance, stating, \"It's incredibly arrogant, too, of him to suggest that his voters will be with him no matter what he does.\"\n\nTrump has often highlighted his loyal supporters as a source of pride for his campaign, and many of his supporters have publicly expressed their devotion to the flamboyant billionaire real estate developer.\n\nIn addition, Mr. de Blasio addressed the possibility of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg entering the presidential race as an independent candidate, expressing concern about the influence of billionaires in the country.\n\n\"I respect my predecessor for sure,\" he said. \"But two things, I'd say. One, my candidate is Hillary Clinton, and I really believe she will be the next president of the United States.\"\n\n\"And the second thing is, I don't think the people of this country want to give more power to billionaires at this point. I think that's what this election increasingly is about, how do we address income inequality, how do we restore the middle class? I don't think most Americans think that billionaires are the ones who are going to help give us a more fair economy,\" Mr. de Blasio said.",
    " Title: U.S., Allies Accuse Russian Hackers of Targeting COVID-19 Vaccine Research Organizations\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. security agencies, in collaboration with their British and Canadian partners, have accused Russian hackers of targeting organizations involved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. The allegations, outlined in an advisory issued on Thursday, have sparked condemnation on both sides of the Atlantic and warnings to companies whose research may be at risk of being stolen.\n\nThe hacking group, known by names such as \"APT29,\" \"the Dukes,\" and \"Cozy Bear,\" has reportedly targeted organizations in the U.S., Britain, and Canada with the \"highly likely\" intention of stealing intellectual property related to the vaccine's development, according to the advisory. No targeted organizations were named in the publicized version of the document, and it did not indicate whether any specific data was actually stolen by hackers.\n\nThe advisory did, however, say the hackers have successfully exploited known computer vulnerabilities to gain \"initial footholds\" within an unspecified number of organizations involved in fighting COVID-19. The hackers used custom malware not publicly associated with any campaigns previously attributed to the group, which has been active since at least 2008 and implicated in several high-profile intrusions, including breaching the Democratic National Committee during the last U.S. presidential race.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (Virginia Democrat), ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, stated, \"It should be clear by now that Russia's hacking efforts didn't stop after the 2016 election. Moving forward, the United States and the western world need to be prepared for increasingly aggressive cyber-attacks from Russian actors.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (California Republican) told The Times, \"These continued malicious actions to weaken our pandemic response must not go unchecked.\" Mr. McCarthy said he intends to introduce legislation soon that would ensure the hackers are held responsible.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (California Democrat) urged President Trump to act and said he was asking for a briefing from his administration. \"There is no issue more critical to the health and safety of our nation and its citizens right now than testing, tracing, treating, and vaccinating,\" said Mr. Schiff. \"The consequences are literally life and death.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters the administration was aware of the activities included in Thursday's advisory, saying the U.S. \"worked very closely with our allies\" to ensure COVID-19 vaccine research was protected.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday called it \"completely unacceptable\" that Russia would allegedly target organizations working to combat the pandemic. Canada's Communications Security Establishment, one of the agencies that issued Thursday's advisory with the U.S. National Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, said the attacks would \"hinder response efforts at a time when health care experts and medical researchers need every available resource.\"\n\nRussia flatly denied responsibility, as it has with other major computer intrusions blamed on President Vladimir Putin's regime. \"We find such accusations unacceptable,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday. \"We have no information on who could have hacked pharmaceutical companies and research centers in the U.K. We can say only one thing, Russia has nothing to do with these attempts.\"",
    " Title: Electoral College Confirms Donald Trump as President Despite Anticipated Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Electoral College is set to confirm Donald Trump as the next President of the United States on Monday, despite efforts to disrupt the 227-year-old process that have so far resulted in only one openly \"faithless\" elector. The anticipated outcome, however, has been met with uncertainty by both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nReince Priebus, White House Chief of Staff in the incoming Trump administration, expressed confidence in a smooth process during an interview on \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday.\" Electors will convene in state capitals across the country to make the results of the November 8 election official.\n\nIn most presidential election years, the Electoral College vote would be a formality. However, electors have been under pressure for weeks from anti-Trump forces to upend the November results, with protests also expected at state capitals on Monday.\n\nTrump's win in the Electoral College, despite losing the popular vote to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, is attributed to his victories in many smaller, less-populated states in the Midwest and South, as well as Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and the big coastal state of Florida. Trump needs 270 electoral votes on Monday, and the state victories put him in line to get 306 of the 538, with each state getting one vote for each House and Senate member. The three remaining votes go to the District of Columbia.\n\nPriebus, who still runs the Republican National Committee, which is trying to keep count of the apportioned or \"pledged\" votes, cited the only known \"faithless\" balloter, who lives in Texas and whose vote goes to Trump but plans to vote for another, yet-to-be-named Republican.\n\nArizona elector Robert Graham reported receiving hundreds of thousands of emails telling him not to vote for Trump and claimed that some of the other 10 electors have been followed or have received death threats. Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party, emphasized the importance of the Electoral College, stating, \"The Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\"\n\nAll electors swore to party officials that they will back Trump, even though they're not legally bound to do so, and plan to hold to that pledge. Trump responded to the reports of elector harassment and intimidation, stating, \"If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!\"\n\nThere is no federal law on electoral votes. Some states bind their voters\u2014often state party officials\u2014to the popular vote. However, the penalties for violations are minor, such as being disqualified from future balloting.\n\nJohn Podesta, Clinton campaign chairman, suggested that 37 electoral voters bound to Trump could defect, which would be enough to create at least a tie and send the vote to the GOP-controlled House, where Trump would still likely win. Podesta, as he has in recent days, pressed the argument that Russians hacking the emails of Democrats during the election led in part to Clinton's loss. He also made a last-minute argument that members of the Electoral College should have an intelligence briefing about the hackings before voting on Monday.\n\nThe Associated Press attempted to reach all 538 electors and was able to interview more than 330 of them. Many reported getting tens of thousands of emails, calls, and letters asking them to vote against Trump. However, the canvass found overwhelming support for the system and the nominee among Republican electors. The AP found only one pledged to Trump who will refuse to vote for him but did not identify him as the voter in Texas.",
    " Title: State and Local Campaign Finance Reform Efforts Gain Traction Amidst Federal Gridlock\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of perceived inaction at the federal level, efforts to rein in money in politics are gaining traction in statehouses and city halls across the United States. From the conservative statehouse in Texas to the liberal city council in Philadelphia, reform measures aimed at curbing the flow of political money or disclosing its sources are being introduced and supported by members of both parties.\n\nOver the past five months, more than 125 bills dealing with campaign finance reform have been introduced in 33 statehouses, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics. More have been introduced in cities as well.\n\nA major bipartisan win for reform advocates came in April when Montana's Democratic Governor Steve Bullock worked with the GOP-controlled Legislature to pass a bill requiring all groups, including 501(c)(4)s, to disclose their donors if they spend money on targeting or supporting a candidate within 60 days of an election.\n\nPoliticians on the state and local level, many of whom are afraid an outside group could fund a primary opponent against them, point to polls that show overwhelming support for campaign finance reform. A recent New York Times/CBS poll found that 85 percent of those surveyed believe the system for funding political campaigns needs either \"fundamental changes\" or a complete overhaul. Based on the same poll, Republicans were almost as likely as Democrats to favor further restrictions on campaign contributions.\n\nOn the federal level, since the Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited giving in the Citizens United v. FEC ruling, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has remained staunchly against efforts to limit political contributions, making it harder to garner GOP support on the issue.\n\nIn recent days alone, a bill requiring all groups to disclose their donors and expenditures proposed by the Philadelphia Board of Ethics advanced and could go into effect as early as July 1. In Texas, the state House passed a similar bill. However, under pressure from independent groups, the state Senate and Governor Greg Abbott opposed including the measure in an ethics package, upending the entire deal.\n\nWith the agency's six-member panel, split equally between Republicans and Democrats, in perpetual gridlock, Republicans on the state and local level have been particularly receptive to backing reform efforts aimed at providing the public with more disclosure, such as the bills in Texas and Montana, despite opposition from powerful groups like the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. McConnell also opposes more political disclosure, saying it would lead to harassment and donor intimidation.\n\n\"When somebody's hiding in the shadows and gut-shoots you, you have a right to know who's taking a shot at you,\" said Montana state Senator Duane Ankney to the Montana Standard earlier this year.\n\nA new group, Take Back Our Republic, formed by John Pudner, who served as a political consultant to David Brat, the academic who ousted former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, is also trying to bring more conservatives on board with reform efforts. The group recently launched 17 chapters in states across the country.\n\nPudner said there's a lot more resistance from Republicans within the Beltway on the issue compared with the rest of the country. \"It seems to be the more conservative members who are most concerned,\" he said, adding that the issue has created a \"true left-right coalition\" in many places.\n\nDale Eisman, spokesman for Common Cause, which has state chapters pushing for campaign finance reform across the country, pointed to polls showing strong support for at least disclosure\u2014if not other campaign finance reforms\u2014to explain recent GOP support.\n\n\"It's not surprising because every poll we see shows that the public is in strong support of disclosure,\" he said. \"The people want this. Legislators\u2014whether Republicans or Democrats\u2014if they want to do what their constituents want, should support disclosure.\"",
    " Title: Walmart Discontinues Sale of Certain Ammunition, Handguns, and Open Carry of Firearms in Stores\n\nArticle:\n\nWalmart, the largest firearms seller in the United States, has announced it will discontinue the sale of certain types of ammunition and handguns, following a series of mass shootings, including one at a Walmart store in Texas that left 22 dead. The decision comes amid increasing pressure on the company, with CEO Doug McMillon stating, \"It's clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable.\"\n\nIn a note to employees and on the firm's website, McMillon explained that the company would discontinue sales of bullets used in assault-style weapons and those used in handguns. The company will also discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, the only place it still offered such weapons. Walmart has also asked customers at its Walmart and Sam's Club stores to stop carrying firearms openly, even in states where it is legally permitted.\n\nThe changes have been met with praise from celebrities, politicians, and several Democratic presidential candidates, but the National Rifle Association (NRA) has criticized the move, calling it \"shameful\" and predicting the company will lose business. Another major US retailer, Kroger, has also changed its policy, asking customers to stop openly carrying guns in stores where state laws allow it.\n\nWalmart's decision to discontinue the sale of certain ammunition and handguns is expected to reduce the company's share of the ammunition market from about 20% to a range of 6% to 9%. The company will continue to sell hunting rifles and shotguns, and much of the ammunition for those weapons. Walmart stock was little changed after the announcement, but shares in some gun-makers, such as Vista Outdoors, slumped.\n\nGuns and ammunition represent a tiny fraction of overall Walmart sales, according to Burt Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. He predicted the decision would pay off, allowing the retailer to provide more store space to faster-growing categories such as baby nappies.\n\nWalmart's decision follows two incidents at stores in August, in which a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, and a former employee killed two workers at a Walmart store in Mississippi. Last month, mass shootings in Ohio and Texas left more than a dozen dead. There have been more than 110 mass shootings in the US since 1982, according to investigative magazine Mother Jones.\n\nWalmart has lagged behind other US retailers in changes to its gun policies. Kroger-owned Fred Meyer stopped selling guns in 2018 after a mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida. That same year, Dick's Sporting Goods ended the sale of assault weapons and raised the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases. The move reflects a shift since Walmart stopped being a family-run company, with Sam Walton, who founded the company in 1962, being a known hunting enthusiast.",
    " Title: G-20 Seating Arrangement: Obama and Putin to be Separated at St. Petersburg Summit\n\nArticle: The upcoming G-20 summit of world leaders in St. Petersburg, Russia, is set to begin on Thursday, and the seating arrangement has sparked discussions regarding the state of U.S.-Russian relations. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the initial seating plan would have had U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin separated only by the Saudi king. However, the seating order has been reshuffled, with five leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, placed between the two key adversaries over Syria and other issues.\n\nThe Russian organizers of the summit reportedly rewrote the seating plan using the Latin alphabet to ensure that Putin and Obama are not seated near each other, as reported by Izvestia on Sept. 4. Minnesota Public Radio's The Daily Circuit blog describes the upcoming Obama-Putin encounter as \"awkward.\"\n\nNPR's Scott Horsley, who is covering Obama's trip to Europe, reports that the two leaders are expected to have brief conversations at some point during the summit, but no lengthy discussions are anticipated. The U.S.-Russian disagreement over Syria and the cancellation of a planned one-on-one summit due to Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to \"NSA leaker\" Edward Snowden have contributed to the \"frosty\" relationship between the two leaders.\n\nIn the past, President Obama has compared Putin's behavior at previous summits to that of a \"bored kid in the back of the classroom.\" However, he added that their conversations are often candid, blunt, and constructive.\n\nVoice of America notes that this wouldn't be the first time summit seating plans have been politicized. At a NATO Summit in Prague in 2002, NATO officials reportedly rewrote the seating arrangement in French to isolate then Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma at the far end of the table.",
    " Title: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to Meet with Russian President Putin Amid Syria Missile Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow, adding to the recent flurry of global diplomatic activity over the ongoing civil war in Syria. According to a Kremlin statement, the meeting will take place in Russia on Tuesday, with \"major attention\" to be paid to the current situation in the Middle East, particularly in Syria.\n\nThe statement did not provide further details, but Agence France-Presse reported on Sunday that Netanyahu's trip was \"reportedly prompted by concerns that Russia was preparing to ship Syria S-300 surface-to-air missiles, which can defend against multiple aircraft and missiles.\"\n\nRussia has been a close ally of President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria throughout the civil war, a fact that has caused consternation in the West and most Middle Eastern nations. Russia has countered that the West is fueling regional instability by supporting the rebels, particularly by empowering Islamist elements.\n\nThe missiles, whose shipment came to light last week, are a source of concern for both Israel, which has staged two airstrikes against targets in Syria in recent weeks, and for the US. According to The \u2588\u2588\u2588, Secretary of State John Kerry stated, \"I think we have made it crystal clear that we would prefer that Russia is not supplying assistance\" to Syria.\n\n\"We have previously stated that [ these ] missiles are potentially destabilizing with respect to the state of Israel,\" Kerry added. The introduction of the S-300 into Syria's air defense arsenal could sharply limit the future options not only for Israel but for the US should it decide to intervene in the conflict.\n\nWhile the US and Israel express their concerns over Russia's missile shipment to the Assad regime, there is cautious optimism in some Western capitals over a planned international conference on Syria that both Moscow and Washington are organizing. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is visiting the White House today, is reportedly set to tell President Barack Obama that he believes Russia is prepared to adopt a more flexible approach to Syria, based on his meeting Friday with Putin in Sochi, Russia.\n\nSpeaking during his flight to Washington, Cameron described his talks with Putin as \"extremely positive and good.\" He said, \"I was very heartened that while it is no secret that Britain and Russia have taken a different approach to Syria, I was very struck in my conversations with President Putin that there is a recognition that it would be in all our interests to secure a safe and secure Syria with a democratic and pluralistic future and end the regional instability.\"\n\nCameron said he would use his meeting with Obama to \"try to really put flesh on the bones of this plan for a peace conference and to think of all the things that would make it work and deliver a peaceful transition in Syria.\" A lot of progress has been made, and I want to push on on that,\" he added.\n\nHowever, experts tell AFP that they doubt the progress will amount to anything concrete. Stephen Sestanovich, an expert in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said this week's agreement on a peace conference \"moves the Geneva [peace plan] formula one step further, but what is one step beyond complete meaninglessness?\"\n\n\"The real issue is whether the Russians are prepared to tell Assad and his supporters that the jig is really up for their regime,\" he added. Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said he was not convinced that the different players' positions had \"changed that much.\"\n\n\"The situation on the ground,\" rather than diplomatic efforts, \"will continue to shape events,\" Shaikh stressed. Reuters notes that it is not yet clear whether the Syrian opposition will attend the US-Russia peace conference. The opposition coalition is set to meet on May 23 to determine whether it will attend, though the coalition itself remains split over the leadership of the group. Reuters writes that two factions, one backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the other by Qatar, are vying for control of the coalition.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Gang of Eight Senators Expect Immigration Overhaul Draft by End of the Week\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of the bipartisan Gang of Eight senators working on immigration overhaul legislation expect to have a draft bill agreeable to their circle by the end of this week. However, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), a member of the group, has stated that it is too soon to consider the deal struck.\n\nIn a statement, Rubio wrote, \"I'm encouraged by reports of an agreement between business groups and unions on the issue of guest workers. However, reports that the bipartisan group of eight senators have agreed on a legislative proposal are premature.\"\n\nShortly after Rubio's statement, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) signaled on CNN's \"State of the Union with Candy Crowley\" that the deal will be reached within days. \"It's got to be written up. We have not signed off,\" he said. \"There are a few details yet, but conceptually - we have an agreement between business and labor, between ourselves. It has to be drafted. It will be rolled out next week.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) concurred on the timeline and acknowledged a few issues remaining to be settled. \"As Sen. Rubio correctly says, we have said we will not come to final agreement until we look at all of the legislative language, and he's correctly pointing out that that language has not been fully drafted,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) also sounded optimistic a deal would be reached but said, \"We've still got a ways to go with the language.\"\n\nBoth Schumer and Rubio are seen as particularly important in this process, with Schumer the Democratic deal-maker who is bringing the sides together and Rubio key to bringing on board conservative members of both the House and Senate.\n\nSchumer said any difference between his view and Rubio's view of progress toward a deal is just \"semantics.\" \"I do not think he'll walk away,\" Schumer said when asked, adding, \"He's had a lot of input into the bill. Obviously, his views are not the same as the other seven of us. Every one of us has different views... He is protecting some of the things that he thinks are very important in the bill, but I do not think that will stand in the way in any way of any agreement.\"\n\nOn Saturday, leaders of labor and business groups reached consensus on the outlines of a guest worker program, a sticking point in the area of immigration between influential lobbies including the AFL-CIO and Chamber of Commerce. The consent of business and labor groups is important not only because it means neither side will fight the bill, but also because a key goal of the Gang of Eight is to restructure the current system for allocating U.S. visas.\n\nThe Gang of Eight includes Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado), Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), John McCain (R-Arizona), and Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey) in addition to Rubio, Graham, Schumer, and Flake.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has described immigration as a top priority of his, but appears to have left the negotiating largely up to Capitol Hill, especially after a draft administration plan for immigration reform was reported publicly and drew criticism from Republicans, including Rubio. A White House official said Saturday the president \"continues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators.\" \"We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced, and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible,\" the official said.",
    " Title: Trump Presidency Puts Voting Rights in Jeopardy\n\nArticle:\n\nWith Donald Trump's presidency, the possibility of him appointing two conservative justices to the Supreme Court has raised concerns for voting rights advocates. The current right-wing efforts to restrict voting rights and the diminished likelihood of challenging and overturning these restrictions are major sources of worry.\n\nDale Ho, the director of the voting rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union, expressed caution, stating, \"It's not the apocalypse yet, but on voting, we're obviously not in as good a position as we expected to be in, and we're going to have to wait and see.\"\n\nThe concern lies in the potential for many voter-suppression tactics to remain in place or even spread, as the addition of two conservative justices could make it difficult to gather the necessary five votes to strike down these types of restrictions. In the past five years, voting rights advocates have been largely in a defensive posture, with the Supreme Court's 2013 decision to weaken the Voting Rights Act being a significant setback.\n\nAnother issue for voting rights advocates under a Trump presidency is the difficulty in expanding the franchise. Existing restrictions on voting rights have already played a role in electing Trump, as my colleague Matthew Rozsa reported. In states like Wisconsin, voter ID laws disproportionately affected nonwhite voters and may have contributed to Trump's victory in the Electoral College.\n\nTrump's campaign platform, which at least in part channeled and evoked white-nationalist sentiment, dovetails with restrictions on voting rights, which are often explicitly aimed at reducing the number of people of color who vote. Trump's initial staffing decisions, such as the appointment of Steve Bannon as his chief White House strategist, suggest a commitment to pursuing an agenda rooted in white-supremacist ideology.\n\nVoter suppression is not only about winning elections, but also about racism. In North Carolina, a voter-suppression law was struck down by the Fourth Circuit Court in August, with the court stating that the law targeted \"African Americans with almost surgical precision.\" With Trump at the helm and his well-documented enthusiasm for racism in play, gathering a fifth vote to further restrict voting rights in the future is much less likely to be a problem.",
    " Title: Obama Family's Annual Christmas Weekly Address: Emphasizing Service, Unity, and Gratitude\n\nIn the spirit of the holiday season, President Barack Obama delivered the annual White House Christmas Weekly Address, joined by his wife, Michelle Obama, and their daughters, Malia and Sasha. The theme of this year's decorations is \"The Gift of the Holidays,\" reflecting the nation's greatest gifts, such as military families and the impact of education.\n\nThe Obamas expressed gratitude for the honor of serving as the President and First Lady for the past eight years. They highlighted their achievements, including recovering from the worst recession in 80 years, reducing unemployment, securing health insurance for 20 million Americans, and taking on global leadership roles.\n\nThe First Lady emphasized the importance of service, quoting the Bible, \"We are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper.\" She encouraged the American people to embody love, compassion, and hope, caring for the sick, feeding the hungry, and welcoming the stranger, regardless of their background or faith.\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged the service and sacrifice of military families, many of whom are away from home during the holiday season. He encouraged the public to support service members, veterans, and military families through the JoiningForces.gov website.\n\nThe Obamas concluded their address by expressing hope for the New Year and wishing the American people a merry Christmas and a happy and healthy 2017. They signed off with a collective message of unity, emphasizing the shared values that guide Americans of all faiths and backgrounds.",
    " Title: Low Trust in Government: A Persistent Trend and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to Gallup and most other polling organizations, Americans have record or near-record low rates of confidence in government. In the second quarter of President Donald Trump's term, only 39% of Americans approved of his performance, a significant 25-point drop from the historical average. Trust in public schools stands at 36%, the criminal justice system at 26%, and Congress at a mere 12%. Trust in most major institutions is lower than it was a decade ago.\n\nLibertarians and other skeptics of government view this trend as a sign that people are finally waking up to reality. However, there are good reasons to be concerned about persistently low levels of trust and confidence in government.\n\nResearchers have found that people in countries with bad governments often desire more government intervention in all aspects of their lives, despite their lack of trust in the government's fairness or effectiveness. A 2010 study found that 82% of former East Germans and 92% of Russians, two famously \"low-trust\" populations, favored wage controls. Residents in Scandinavia and North America, which are \"high-trust\" regions, were far more trusting of market forces.\n\nIt appears that government may be growing not in spite of our lack of confidence in it, but because of our lack of confidence in it. This self-defeating spiral will only get worse if the United States fails to stem its slide toward being a low-trust country.\n\nThe solution does not have to be nihilism or anarchy. Instead, we need a government that does fewer things but does them better. Government spending is at an already swollen 21% of GDP and is predicted to climb to 30% over the next three decades. Libertarians rightly want a limited government, and we should fight to end cronyism, drug prohibition, and regulatory overreach that increases the cost of doing business. We need to keep pushing back against defense spending wasted on elective wars and national security measures that put us under surveillance without making us safer.\n\nHowever, we should also point to places where government action is both legitimate and effective and praise policies\u2014like school choice, for instance\u2014that deliver better results at cheaper costs. Ironically, if we can get more people to trust the government, it just might be easier to shrink the size, scope, and spending of the state.\n\nThis article was produced by Todd Krainin, written by Nick Gillespie, and cameras by Jim Epstein.",
    " Title: Mnuchin's Senate Hearing: Five-Hour Testimony Marked by Tough Questions and Policy Cautiousness\n\nArticle:\n\nSteven Mnuchin's Senate hearing concluded after a five-hour session, during which he faced a series of challenging questions primarily from Democratic senators regarding his business background, investment holdings, and financial disclosures. Compared to his two television interviews in November, Mnuchin provided fewer policy details in the hearing.\n\nIn an effort to soften some of Donald Trump's controversial statements on tariffs, the dollar, and the U.S. debt, Mnuchin adopted positions that resembled those of the outgoing Treasury secretary. He emphasized the need to promptly raise the debt limit when its current suspension expires in March and to increase staffing at the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nIn other policy areas, Mnuchin adopted moderate positions without fully departing from the Republican orthodoxy. For instance, on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he expressed support for maintaining the bureau but suggested altering its funding mechanism, a change that some Democrats have expressed concern could lead to the agency's significant constriction.\n\nOn the Volcker Rule, Mnuchin supported the rule's objective but also outlined changes that its proponents have argued would weaken it. Although he appeared to distance himself from past support for privatizing mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, he acknowledged their importance to the mortgage market and their past valuable roles.\n\nDemocrats attempted to question Mnuchin over disclosures that he did not make to the committee until committee staffers pointed out the oversights. Mnuchin attributed these mistakes to paperwork errors. They also sought to probe potential conflicts of interest due to Donald Trump not placing his extensive real-estate holdings into a blind trust.\n\nRepublicans did not seem troubled by these issues, with the exception of Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who raised concerns over Mnuchin's lack of response to earlier questions about his foreclosure record at OneWest Bank in his home state.",
    " Title: Graham-Cassidy Bill: Latest Attempt to Repeal Affordable Care Act Faces Uncertain Future\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Graham-Cassidy bill, the latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is facing an uncertain future as it undergoes revisions to secure the support of key senators. Under the revised bill, states could potentially allow insurers to set higher premiums based on a person's health status, though not on the basis of sex or genetic information.\n\nState officials, in applying for federal grants, would be required to describe how they would \"maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\" However, changes to the bill's funding formula to win over Senator Lisa Murkowski could cost it support from conservatives. The hasty revisions have also raised concerns that Congress may be moving forward on a bill that has not been thoroughly vetted.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office is set to release a partial analysis of the bill's impact as soon as Monday, but this report may not include the latest changes. President Trump, speaking to reporters in New Jersey on Sunday, seemed to be looking ahead to the next legislative goal for Republicans\u2014overhauling the tax code\u2014while also discussing the Graham-Cassidy bill and applying pressure to resistant senators.\n\nThe architects of the latest repeal plan, Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, are not giving up. \"We're moving forward, and we'll see what happens next week,\" said Senator Graham on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I'm very excited about it. We finally found an alternative to Obamacare that makes sense.\"\n\nWhite House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short stated on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that a Senate vote was planned for this week. However, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to confirm that timeline on Sunday. The Graham-Cassidy bill aims to repeal the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, as well as the tax credits that help people buy insurance on the individual market. In their place, it would provide block grants to the states to use for healthcare. The bill's future remains uncertain as it faces opposition from both sides of the political spectrum.",
    " Title: Senate to Approve Three Obama Nominees This Week, According to Reid\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is expected to approve three more of President Barack Obama's nominees this week, as announced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Wednesday. Reid anticipates the confirmation of Fred Hochberg to head the Export-Import Bank, Gina McCarthy to head the Environmental Protection Agency, and Tom Perez to lead the Labor Department by the end of business on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a leadership aide, Hochberg is likely to be confirmed on Wednesday, with final approval for McCarthy and Perez potentially coming as early as Thursday, depending on the amount of debate time requested by Republicans. The Senate typically adjourns for the weekend on Thursday afternoons, making it likely that the three nominations will be completed before Friday morning.\n\nThe progress on the long-stalled nominations follows the approval of Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday. The agreements to vote on these nominees, as well as three candidates for the National Labor Relations Board, are the result of a Tuesday deal between Reid and Republicans to avoid an unprecedented Senate rules change.\n\nReid had previously threatened to change the Senate's rules to move those nominations forward in the face of Republican filibusters. However, the \"nuclear option\" of a rules change on votes on executive nominees, which would have lowered the voting threshold on some of Obama's picks from 60 to 51, was averted. Instead, senators agreed to fill the NLRB and allow Hochberg, McCarthy, Perez, and Cordray to proceed without a change to the Senate rules.\n\nReid expressed hope that this agreement marks a new era of cooperation in the Senate, stating, \"We have now started a new era, I hope a new normal in the Senate where senators talk to each other rather than past each other.\"",
    " Title: Discussion on Leadership Change in Democratic Party Amid Georgia Election Loss\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the loss of the Georgia special election and other congressional races this year, there has been a surge of discussions about whether House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi should step down from her Democratic leadership role. This conversation has extended to President Trump, who tweeted on Thursday, \"I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!\"\n\nIn response, Pelosi stated later that morning that Trump's comments were a typical Republican line and that he likely received the script from members of his party. \"He then added the Chuck Schumer bit,\" she said at a briefing.\n\nPelosi defended her position and asserted her status as a master legislator and politically astute leader. While she respects the opinions of her caucus members, she added, \"My decision of how long I stay is not up to them.\"\n\nSince Jon Ossoff's loss to Karen Handel on Tuesday night, a few congressional Democrats have expressed a desire for leadership change, including Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, according to CNN. Rice stated, \"We need leadership change. It's time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and the entire leadership team.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas expressed similar sentiments, stating, \"You'd have to be an idiot to think winning the House in 2018 was possible with Pelosi in charge.\" Vela added, \"Nancy Pelosi is not the only reason that Ossoff lost, but she certainly is one of the reasons.\"\n\nHowever, despite the Georgia special election loss, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, expressed optimism about the possibility of Democrats winning enough seats for a House majority in 2018.",
    " Title: \"2016: A Year of Reflection and Restoration for the United States\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the new year approaches, the focus of many Americans is on the challenges faced by the country over the past seven years. The article discusses the perceived failures of President Obama's administration and the need for a change in direction. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing the resilience of the American people and the strength of the Founding Fathers' foundation for the nation.\n\nThe article criticizes the left for advocating for changes to the Constitution and the amendments, referring to them as \"harpies and trolls.\" The author attributes the strength of the Constitution and the nation to the work of the original Founding Fathers, who established a foundation to prevent disturbed individuals and tyranny.\n\nThe author argues that the current state of the nation and the world is a result of the actions of career politicians, and that the establishment has facilitated this disaster by going along to get along. The article mentions several issues facing the nation, including the childish and incompetent destruction of the health insurance and health care system, leftist bullying on college campuses, open borders, Islamic State plots, urban riots, high numbers of Americans on food stamps, and a government campaign to disarm Americans while importing potential terrorists.\n\nThe author also discusses the rise of Republican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, and the establishment's perceived fear of their campaigns. The article mentions comments made by Republican operatives Rick Wilson and Pat Brady, who have suggested taking action against Trump and Cruz, respectively.\n\nThe author argues that the establishment's fear of the current political climate is unwarranted, and that the American people are not divided or fearful, but rather angry and concerned. The author suggests that replacing failed leadership is a restoration, not an abandonment, of the system established by the Founding Fathers. The author concludes by comparing the current political climate to historical events such as Yorktown and the beaches at Normandy, emphasizing the importance of getting it right in 2016.",
    " Title: Easing the Path to Bankruptcy for Small Businesses: A Potential Solution Amidst the Economic Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to an economic crisis in the United States, with small businesses being one of the most affected sectors. Small businesses, which account for more than 99 percent of all businesses in the U.S. and nearly 50 percent of all employment, are at a significant risk of failure as the virus spreads and people practice social distancing.\n\nCurrently, a $2 trillion economic relief package has been passed by the Senate and is moving to the House. This package includes a $367 billion loan program to help small businesses weather this difficult time. However, additional steps can be taken by the federal government to further support America's small-business owners.\n\nIn normal circumstances, small businesses have a high failure rate, with only about 50 percent surviving the first five years and only 30 percent surviving longer than 10 years. The U.S. bankruptcy system offers these failed entrepreneurs a \"fresh start\" by wiping out debts and pardoning failure. By filing under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy laws, entrepreneurs can shield some or all of their assets from creditors and are released from any future obligation to repay debts.\n\nHowever, there is a lack of consistent bankruptcy policy across the states, which creates an unintended barrier to small business owners who need relief. Since the Federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978 was enacted, bankruptcy exemption levels are set by the states and vary widely. For example, in seven states or regions, the homestead exemptions are unlimited, while in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, they are zero. All other states lie somewhere in between.\n\nOther bankruptcy routes include Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, which are reorganization procedures. While Chapter 7 is the usual route for consumer filings, Chapter 13 is available to individuals with regular income and sole proprietors, and Chapter 11 is typically available to corporations or partnerships. The amount of debt discharged approaches that under Chapter 7, but both procedures require the debtor to establish a repayment plan paid for with future income.\n\nIn 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) with the primary intention of making it harder for individuals to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The reform introduced a means test for Chapter 7, which essentially prevented individuals earning above-average income from wiping out their debt through filing under Chapter 7. Instead, such individuals would be able to file under Chapter 13, which allows debt discharge only after the individual has made some repayments.\n\nBAPCPA also lowered exemptions for certain assets and debtors now need to undergo credit counseling before filing\u2014a costly process and, for many business owners, not particularly useful. Research suggests a modest but unarguably negative impact from some of these changes on small-firm entry decisions. Others find a 50 percent reduction in Chapter 7 filings after the act's passage, and a 25 percent increase in insolvency, leading to worse outcomes for financially distressed borrowers.\n\nWhile these provisions may work to reduce bankruptcy abuse in normal economic times, these are not normal economic times. It is in the taxpayers' interest to do everything reasonably possible to protect small businesses\u2014responsible for creating millions of jobs\u2014from going under. Allowing small businesses to have an easier path to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy could provide them a fresh start when the crisis is over. By easing the costs associated with a Chapter 7 filing, removing means-tested filing for a temporary period, and allowing more individuals and small businesses to file and claim unlimited homestead and personal property exemptions for a temporary period, we can provide greater protections to the assets of small business owners.\n\nAparna Mathur is a Resident Scholar in Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
    " Title: US-North Korea Summit: Preparations Underway for Possible Trump-Kim Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nA US team is currently engaged in negotiations with North Korean officials in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, signaling a potential revival of the planned meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The talks, held in the village of Panmunjom, are the latest indication that the summit could take place after President Trump called off the meeting, citing North Korea's \"hostility\" on Thursday.\n\nOn Saturday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held an unannounced meeting, with Mr. Moon stating that Kim had \"again made clear his commitment to a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\" Kim later expressed his \"fixed will\" for the summit to proceed, and Trump tweeted on Sunday that the meeting would help the North achieve its \"brilliant potential.\"\n\nThe US team, led by Sung Kim, a former ambassador to South Korea, is reportedly holding talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. The aim of the talks is to set an agenda for the summit between the leaders.\n\nWhile officials appear more optimistic about the meeting going ahead, recent weeks have shown that the relationship can change very quickly, according to the BBC's Chris Butler in Washington. There is still a lot of ground to be covered, and President Trump has shown that if he does not think a deal can be done, he will not go.\n\nIt is unclear whether Kim will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal, as similar pledges in the past have not been upheld. Analysts say the US had wanted denuclearization first, followed by rewards in the form of lifted sanctions and economic aid. However, Kim has indicated he wants a phased approach, with his steps met by reciprocal ones from the US and the South, mainly on sanctions but also easing of the US military presence in South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has been subjected to numerous rounds of international sanctions since 2006, which has cut off most of its exports and capped its imports of oil. The North also wants assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question.\n\nGetting this far has been a surprise given that North Korea had maintained its strident rhetoric and continued its nuclear and missile tests through 2016 and 2017. This brought a bitter war of words between President Trump and the North Korean leadership. However, a rapprochement began in January when Kim suggested he was \"open to dialogue\" with South Korea. The following month, the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, held in the South. Kim announced he was suspending nuclear tests and held his landmark summit with Mr. Moon last month. This week, North Korea said it had dismantled its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, although scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017.",
    " Title: Clinton's Challenges in Mobilizing Voters Beyond Primary Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing speculation regarding Hillary Clinton's ability to appeal to Bernie Sanders' supporters in the general election and the potential for Sanders to hinder Clinton's prospects is a topic of discussion among Democrats. History suggests that there is little reason for concern, as candidates typically fight hard until they stop fighting, and post-primary unity is crucial for capturing the Senate.\n\nHowever, the real challenge for Clinton lies not in reaching Sanders' supporters but in mobilizing the larger universe of left-of-center voters who did not participate in the primary elections. In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama garnered 17,584,692 votes, and Clinton lost despite winning about 260,000 more votes. To win, Clinton needs to mobilize not just Sanders' supporters but the much larger group of left-of-center voters who did not vote in the primaries.\n\nThe Clinton-Sanders race is not as close as the 2008 primary, but it is a lower-turnout affair. Sanders has about 10 million votes, and Clinton has about 13 million. Both numbers will increase once California and New Jersey vote, but they will not reach the levels seen in 2008.\n\nGeneral election winners need way more votes than the combined Clinton-Sanders total. Obama got 66 million votes in 2012, George W. Bush got 62 million votes in 2004, and even in the low-turnout three-way race of 1992, when the population was lower, Bill Clinton got 45 million votes.\n\nThe people who voted for Sanders in the primary are some of the lowest-hanging fruit for Clinton, as they are already registered to vote and are taking an unusually high level of interest in politics. Their names and contact information will be on Sanders' campaign lists, and Sanders will be endorsing Clinton and campaigning for her.\n\nThe real problem for Clinton is reaching the legions of people with left-of-center political views who are less attached to the political process than actual Bernie Sanders voters. Younger people and nonwhites, in particular, seem less connected to the political process and more willing to stay home from the polls.\n\nClinton's weakness with young voters was evident in both the 2008 and 2016 primaries. To win, she needs to reach a lot of young people who have not stirred themselves to vote for Sanders, which is a harder challenge.\n\nDemocrats' current hope is that fear of Donald Trump will be an excellent motivator to drive turnout among the Obama coalition of minority groups and young people. However, it is far from clear that this sort of negative focus is a successful voter turnout strategy.\n\nVoting is not a very rational course of action, and the odds that one's decision to vote or stay home will actually be the difference between Donald Trump ending up in or out of the White House are incredibly small. People vote for the same kinds of reasons that they attend political rallies\u2014we are communal beings, and it's nice to sometimes take part in larger activities.\n\nClinton, who would be the first woman president if elected, certainly has the potential to play a role in people's thinking. However, her generally low approval ratings, the fact that she is getting fewer votes than she did eight years ago, and her weak performance in the primary with young women are all signs that she is struggling in practice to do it.\n\nThe best news for Clinton is that Trump is viewed even less favorably by the public and will face his own massive challenges in securing Republican turnout. However, the basic dynamics of a race to the bottom in terms of voter enthusiasm are not all that favorable to Democrats\u2014as we've seen in the past two midterm elections. The map we see every presidential election is pretty much useless.",
    " Title: Proposed Amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to Protect Against Viewpoint Discrimination\n\nArticle:\n\nA call for an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, aimed at protecting employees from workplace discrimination based on their political views, is gaining traction in the United States. The current law does not cover political views, leaving employees vulnerable to termination or denial of employment opportunities due to their political beliefs.\n\nThe issue, often referred to as \"cancel culture,\" has been criticized for its impact on free speech and the ability of individuals to express their opinions on important public matters without fear of economic and social repercussions. The proposed amendment would add \"viewpoints or beliefs\" to the list of prohibited discriminations, which currently includes race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\n\nThe amendment would give employees legal recourse against viewpoint discrimination, potentially deterring employers from bowing to pressure from activist groups or public opinion. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and, in extreme cases, the Justice Department could also take enforcement actions for such instances of surrendering to public pressure.\n\nCurrently, four states and the District of Columbia have some form of viewpoint-discrimination protections in their laws, but 46 states do not. Additionally, people employed by the government, who are protected by the First Amendment, have free-speech protections, subject to certain limits. The proponents of the amendment argue that it is unfair for those in the private economy to be left without such protections.\n\nThe effects of this legal gap are not limited to employment decisions. Across the country, the ability of activist groups to block or ruin the careers of their opponents has created a climate of fear and repression, particularly among young people.\n\nThe proposed amendment is gaining support from various political perspectives, with the exception of the extreme left and the libertarian fringe. Supporters argue that the amendment is necessary to protect the foundational right to freedom of speech, which they believe is essential for a functioning democracy.\n\nMichael Schwartz, of counsel at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, has expressed his support for the amendment. The views expressed are his own.",

Oren, speaking in the aftermath of the horrendous attack on the Boston Marathon, emphasized that both the American and Israeli societies, which value their freedom, must refuse to succumb to fear.\n\nOren highlighted the resilience of the people of Boston, who were celebrating liberty's birthday on the day of the bombing. He pointed out that communities, caregivers, police, security forces, elected leaders, and volunteers can unite during such times to block terrorists from achieving their objectives. While taking all possible measures to prevent further loss of life, the ambassador stressed the importance of refusing to forfeit one's way of life.\n\nOren acknowledged the emotional damage inflicted on countless citizens by the attack, but also emphasized the healing process that begins when first responders rush to assist the fallen. He noted the acts of selflessness displayed by the heroic first responders, athletes, and countless others in the aftermath of the attack, which serve as a reminder of the American spirit and its capacity to overcome terror and emerge stronger.\n\nThe ambassador concluded by expressing solidarity with the bereaved and the injured, and reiterating the importance of remembering the victims while refusing to be victimized. Oren's remarks underscored the shared experiences of the United States and Israel in dealing with terrorism, and the determination of both nations to defend their democratic liberties and remain vigilant and resolute in the face of such attacks.",

Trump's tweet also stated that the tariff will escalate by 5 percentage points each month, reaching 25% by October 1, if the illegal immigration problem is not remedied.\n\nIn response to Trump's statements, AMLO said, \"With all due respect, although you have the right to express it, 'America First' is a fallacy because, until the end of times, even beyond national borders, justice and universal fraternity will prevail.\"\n\nTrump defended his proposal in Friday morning tweets, blaming Mexico and congressional Democrats for the migrant problems on the border. \"Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,\" Trump tweeted, claiming that \"Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S.\" and \"they can easily fix this problem.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump claimed that companies would leave Mexico to avoid the tariffs, but it should not come to that. \"Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels,\" he said in a tweet. \"The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!\"\n\nTrump did not define what a sufficient solution would be to stop the wave after wave of Central American migrants journeying through Mexico to reach the U.S. southern border. According to Border Patrol data, U.S. Border Patrol agents have apprehended more than 280,000 migrants entering the country illegally who are minors or members of family units during the first seven months of the 2019 fiscal year. Of those, 97% are from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and only 3% are from Mexico.\n\nIn his written statement, Trump also said, \"Workers who come to our country through the legal admissions process, including those working on farms, ranches, and in other businesses, will be allowed easy passage.\"\n\nIn his public letter responding to Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador said Mexico is already doing what it can to stop the migration, and added that \"social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures.\" He also told Trump, \"Please, remember that I do not lack valor, that I am not a coward nor timorous but rather act according to principles.\"\n\nCiting the United States' history as a nation of immigrants, L\u00f3pez Obrador also told Trump, \"The Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol.\"",

According to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, Ernst leads Braley 45-43, a lead that falls within the poll's margin of error.\n\nThe race between Ernst and Braley could potentially shift the balance of power in Washington, as Republicans are favored to take back the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections. The results from the survey of 967 likely voters in Iowa echo two other nonpartisan polls this month, which also showed Ernst with a narrow one- to two-point edge.\n\nAs the election day approaches on November 4, both candidates will focus on winning over undecided voters and the 10 percent of likely voters who stated they could still change their minds. The poll reveals a significant shift in independent support, with Braley converting a seven-point deficit in Quinnipiac's September poll into a five-point lead among independents. Braley now leads independents 48% to Ernst's 43%.\n\nBraley also continues to gain support among women, leading his female GOP opponent by a 13-point margin. Ernst, on the other hand, maintains her lead among men at 56% to Braley's 39%.\n\n\"Voters are choosing partisanship over gender when it comes to making their ballot choice,\" Quinnipiac University Polling Director Peter Brown said in a release.\n\nErnst may also benefit from the expected strong performance of Republican Governor Terry Branstad, who has a 15-point lead according to the Quinnipiac poll.",
    " Title: NBC's Portrayal of Obama's ISIS Interview as \"Very Candid\" Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with 60 Minutes, President Barack Obama discussed the U.S.'s handling of the Islamic State (ISIS) threat in the Middle East. On Monday, NBC's Today show presented the interview as a \"very candid\" admission by the President, but the portrayal has sparked controversy due to the President's apparent attempts to distance himself from blame.\n\nCo-host Matt Lauer opened the show by stating, \"Underestimated. The President admits his administration and U.S. intelligence officials misjudged the threat of ISIS.\" However, a soundbite of the President later in the show showed him distancing himself from blame, saying, \"I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.\"\n\nLater in the show, Lauer introduced the story, stating, \"President Obama acknowledging in a new interview that U.S. officials underestimated ISIS and overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to take on the terror group.\" NBC's chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel reported that the President blamed the former U.S.-backed Iraqi government for allowing ISIS to flourish and said American intelligence did not fully appreciate the threat.\n\nHowever, The Daily Beast's Eli Lake criticized Obama's attempt to blame the intelligence community for dropping the ball on ISIS. In an interview with The Daily Beast after Obama's interview aired, a former senior Pentagon official who worked closely on the threat posed by Sunni jihadists in Syria and Iraq was reportedly flabbergasted, saying, \"Either the president does not read the intelligence he's getting or he's bullshitting.\"\n\nNBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell also dismantled the President's claims of being in the dark about ISIS on August 10 on Meet the Press. On September 3, Engel himself appeared on Mitchell's MSNBC show and explained that the President's claim of having no strategy for Syria was \"quite ridiculous\" given the buildup of ISIS had been well-documented for over three years.\n\nGiven NBC's own reporting on how Obama knew about the ISIS build-up all along, the network's description of the President passing the blame as \"very candid\" has been met with criticism. On ABC's Good Morning America on Monday, co-host George Stephanopoulos tried to push similar spin regarding Obama's remarks to 60 Minutes, but White House correspondent Jon Karl called out the presidential blame game.\n\nCBS This Morning led with a clip of Obama's exchange with 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft, then at the top of the 8 a.m. ET hour brought on Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan to offer criticism of the President's handling of ISIS. After Ryan pointed out \"colossal mistakes in our Iraq and Syria policy that led to this emergence of ISIS,\" co-host Charlie Rose pinned the blame on the President.\n\nHere is a full transcript of Engel's September 29 report on Today:\n\n[Transcript not provided]\n\nThe controversy surrounding NBC's portrayal of Obama's interview highlights the ongoing debate over the U.S.'s role in the Middle East and the handling of the ISIS threat."
