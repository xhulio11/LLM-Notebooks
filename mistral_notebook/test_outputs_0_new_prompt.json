    " Title: Germany's Coronavirus Death Rate Remains Low Despite High Case Count\n\nArticle:\n\nAs of March 25, Germany has reported 175 deaths and 34,055 cases of the coronavirus, making it the fifth-highest number of cases globally. However, Germany's fatality rate from COVID-19, at 0.5%, is the world's lowest. Christian Drosten, director of the Institute of Virology at Berlin's Charit\u00e9 hospital, attributes this to Germany's ability to test early and often.\n\nDrosten, who led the team that developed the first COVID-19 test used in the public domain, estimates that Germany has been testing around 120,000 people a week for COVID-19 during the month-long period from late February to now. This extensive testing regimen is believed to be the most extensive in the world.\n\nGermany's low fatality rate is due to its ability to test early and often, according to Drosten. He suggests that Germany's lower number of undetected cases compared to other countries with less prevalent testing could be a factor. Germany's culture, Drosten explains, does not support a centralized diagnostic system, allowing for a more open market for testing.\n\nLothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal agency responsible for disease control and prevention, stated that Germany's testing infrastructure provides a more accurate read of confirmed cases of the virus. However, some Berlin residents have expressed concerns about access to testing.\n\nNizana Nizzi Brautmann, a Berlin resident, shared her experience of being unable to get tested when a teacher at her son's school tested positive for COVID-19. She was eventually able to speak to a doctor on the phone, who advised her to wait in line outside a local hospital for testing but did not have a mask for herself or her son, and did not want to infect others in line.\n\nDespite these concerns, Drosten believes such experiences are probably an exception rather than the rule. He states that the supply of tests in Germany is still good, and the country has had a robust response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, he expresses concern for countries in Africa that are not well-equipped to handle the pandemic.",
    " Title: Black Lives Matter Global Network's Funding Structure and Transparency\n\nArticle:\n\nFactCheck.org and Politifact have confirmed that the Black Lives Matter Global Network is not a recognized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) charity. Instead, the organization raises funds through a fiscal sponsor, global nonprofit Thousand Currents. This arrangement, according to some critics, may block full transparency.\n\nActBlue, a fundraising platform, helps to raise funds for Black Lives Matter Global Network by directing donations to Thousand Currents, their fiscal sponsor. The partnership between ActBlue and Thousand Currents was announced in 2016, with the latter providing \"fiduciary oversight, financial management, and other administrative services to BLM.\"\n\nCaleb Cade, a spokesperson for ActBlue, confirmed to the fact-checking site that \"donations made through ActBlue go to Thousand Currents for Black Lives Matter.\" Jenesha de Rivera, director of finance and administration at Thousand Currents, reportedly stated that the foundation has applied to become its own 501(c)(3), but Black Lives Matter never returned their request for a Form 1023, the form used to apply for 501(c)(3) status.\n\nFiscal sponsorships are common, according to the National Council on Nonprofits. These arrangements offer a way for a cause to attract donors even when it is not yet recognized as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3). In essence, the fiscal sponsor serves as the administrative \"home\" of the cause, with charitable contributions given to the fiscal sponsor, which then grants them to support the cause.\n\nBenjamin Leff, a professor who specializes in nonprofits, told the fact-checking site that based upon his general understanding of fiscal sponsorships, \"both ActBlue Charities and Thousand Currents have a legal obligation to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the funds they receive are spent consistent with 501(c)(3) restrictions.\"\n\nHowever, Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, suggested that the fiscal sponsorship route blocks full transparency, particularly when it comes to its partnership with ActBlue. \"Transparency?\" he posted, linking to Politifact. \"So if you want to make a tax-deductible charitable donation directly to Black Lives Matter, you can't. You donate to Act Blue Charities. Act Blue Charities sends this money, allegedly, to another charity, Thousand Currents, which runs BLM as a 'fiscal sponsorship.'\"\n\nAccording to FactCheck.org, \"A Thousand Currents audit for 2019 shows that, as of June 2019, the organization held nearly $3.4 million in net assets for Black Lives Matter. It had released nearly $1.8 million to the group in the last fiscal year.\" The fact-check adds that the audit provides a breakdown of how the foundation spent that $1.8 million, including on consultants and salaries.",
    " Title: An Analysis of Racism Accusations in American Politics: A Neutral Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the Gospel according to St. Matthew, Saint Peter asks Christ how often a person should be forgiven. Christ responds, \"Not seven times, but seventy times seven.\" If taken literally, this would imply that the 491st sin is unforgivable.\n\nIn American politics, the accusation of racism, often referred to as the \"491st sin,\" is a potent and divisive charge. It is a term that, when levied, demands ostracization and labels the accused a moral pariah. This is evident in the recent political discourse, with figures such as Hillary Clinton employing such accusations, particularly in the context of courting support from African-American and Hispanic communities.\n\nClinton's rhetoric has been criticized for dipping into McCarthyite smears, implying guilt by association. While she did not explicitly label Donald Trump a racist, she suggested that those aligned with the \"alt-right\" movement, who support him, are racist.\n\nThe \"alt-right\" is a term that is not clearly defined, and opinions on the group's ideology vary widely. From casual observation, a few members may hold racist views, while most do not. If one is looking for racism, the Black Lives Matter movement or Hillary Clinton herself could be potential sources.\n\nOn the right, some argue that the biggest racists are libertarians, who, despite their supposed meritocratic beliefs, may harbor an unhealthy fascination with IQ scores and racial hierarchies, as suggested by works like \"The Bell Curve\" by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all nationalists are racists. Nationalists accept all fellow citizens as their peers, and their primary concern is the well-being of their own country and its citizens. They may be chauvinistic or xenophobic, but they do not necessarily hold racist views.\n\nIn this context, Donald Trump and his supporters can be considered nationalists, not racists. The accusation that Trump supporters are racists, especially among Trump-haters on the right, remains to be seen.\n\nIn conclusion, the accusation of racism in American politics is a complex and sensitive issue. It is crucial to approach such discussions with a nuanced understanding of the various ideologies and perspectives at play, and to avoid making sweeping generalizations or assumptions about individuals or groups based on their political affiliations or beliefs.",
    " Title: Four Cities Legalize Marijuana in Tuesday's Elections: A Milestone in the Marijuana Legalization Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nFour cities in the United States voted to legalize marijuana in Tuesday's elections, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing marijuana legalization movement. The cities include three in Michigan and the first on the East Coast, Portland, Maine. However, these votes are largely symbolic as the states of Michigan and Maine still consider marijuana illegal.\n\nThe latest Gallup Poll, released in October, found that 58% of Americans support marijuana legalization, a 10-point increase from a year earlier. This represents the highest level of support for marijuana legalization in American history, with a majority of Americans backing it for the first time, according to both the Gallup and Pew studies.\n\nAnalysts and advocates attribute the sudden surge in support to several factors. One reason is the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington, which has brought the issue to the forefront of a national conversation. Additionally, during a time of tight federal budgets, people are increasingly disagreeing with robust law enforcement spending, which experts say leads to high incarceration rates. Furthermore, the federal government is allowing states to move forward with legalization and is not aggressively enforcing federal marijuana crime laws.\n\nAllen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law, believes the country is moving closer to legalization. In addition to the two states that have legalized it, 21 states allow medical marijuana, and 17 have decided to decriminalize it, St. Pierre said. In the next two elections, voters in five states are expected to have a say in the issue, with ballot initiatives expected in California, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Alaska.\n\nThe issue of marijuana legalization has taken a similar trajectory as same-sex marriage, which has also seen a flood of public support in recent years. In both cases, the same groups of people are opposed: those who are most religious and those over 55. Additionally, in both cases, liberals and young people are most likely to support the issues. However, William Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautions against too closely linking the two issues, as Republicans and conservatives are much more likely to oppose same-sex marriage, and those against are strongly opposed.\n\nDespite the differences in the two issues, support is growing for both. Interestingly, the liberalization of the issues comes at a time when the country remains mostly conservative. In 2012, a Gallup survey found that 40% of Americans identify as conservative, while 35% identify as moderate. Only 21% call themselves liberals. Moderates have been declining since the poll began asking the question in 1992 as more are identifying as either liberal or conservative.\n\nGalston suggests that the increase in support for marijuana legalization could be an example of an issue where the liberal and libertarian-minded conservatives are on the same page. \"It's perfectly possible for a country to become more conservative about economic policy and more liberal on issues affecting personal liberty,\" Galston said. \"I just described libertarianism to you.\"",
    " Title: Four Key Insights from New Hampshire Primary Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New Hampshire primary elections took place on Tuesday, providing valuable insights into the ongoing U.S. presidential race. Here are four significant takeaways from the first-in-the-nation primary:\n\n1. The impact of Marco Rubio's debate performance:\nMarco Rubio entered New Hampshire with a strong momentum, moving into second place in the polls. However, his performance during the ABC debate on Saturday was criticized, potentially damaging his campaign. Rubio's campaign has since downplayed the debate's impact, lowering expectations. The results of the New Hampshire primary will reveal the extent of the damage to Rubio's campaign following his debate performance.\n\n2. Hillary Clinton's expected margin of victory over Bernie Sanders:\nClinton's narrow victory in Iowa provided her no momentum in New Hampshire. A significant win for Sanders in New Hampshire could boost his campaign ahead of the Nevada caucuses, where the Clinton campaign is relying on its union-based support. A close race between Clinton and Sanders in New Hampshire would indicate Clinton's ability to maintain her campaign, while a double-digit win for Sanders would suggest a strong momentum for his campaign.\n\n3. The potential shrinkage of the GOP field:\nBefore the primary, it was expected that the Republican field would consist of three candidates post-New Hampshire: Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. However, the results of the New Hampshire primary could determine whether one or more governors place in the top three or four, potentially leading them to continue their campaigns until the South Carolina primary.\n\n4. The fate of candidates with lower polling numbers:\nOhio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have all stated their intentions to continue to South Carolina. However, if they do not place in the top tier, their fundraising could dwindle, and there may be pressure on them to withdraw from the race. The New Hampshire primary results will determine the extent to which the GOP field will be reduced.",
    " Title: Trump Delays Immigration Overhaul Vote, Citing Need for More Congressional Seats\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014President Donald Trump has advised Republicans to postpone an immigration overhaul until after the November midterm elections, effectively delaying a House bill that was initially scheduled for next week.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, President Trump stated, \"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November.\" He further added, \"Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything that solves this decades-old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\"\n\nCurrently, Republicans hold majorities of 51-49 in the Senate and 235-193 in the House. Some election watchers predict Democrats may gain seats in the House in the midterm elections this fall, potentially regaining majority control.\n\nDespite the flagging support for the effort, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), the chief deputy whip, stated on Friday that the planned immigration vote will move ahead. He cited party leaders' promise to GOP moderates.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) had agreed to hold a vote on what Republicans called a compromise bill to head off a special maneuver called a discharge petition that would have allowed centrist Republicans to join with Democrats to bring their own immigration bills to the floor.\n\n\"There\u2019s no significant dynamic shift in our conference on immigration,\" Mr. McHenry said when asked if there was sufficient support to pass the consensus bill. He added, \"The president is speaking truth. If you want to fix immigration crisis in a holistic way, you\u2019re going to need Democrats to participate in this process.\"\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the Democratic leader, has rejected labeling the bill a compromise, stating its provisions on Dreamers\u2014young immigrants brought to the country as minors and living in the U.S. without authorization\u2014and the zero-tolerance policy of charging adult illegal immigrants are too harsh for her party to accept. No Democrats were expected to support the measure.\n\nHouse Republican leaders had seen President Trump's salesmanship as essential to pushing an immigration plan through the House. The Republican president's position on the compromise bill has shifted several times over the past week, first rejecting it, then supporting it, and now suggesting it should be put off until after the November election.\n\nPresident Trump also changed a policy this week that resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents at the border. He issued an executive order that keeps his zero-tolerance stance on arresting illegal border crossers in place but directs that families be kept together.\n\nThe president's support of the compromise bill had given some Republicans political cover, particularly from conservative critics who charged that granting protected status to young immigrants amounted to amnesty. With that support now gone, the bill's future is more in doubt.\n\n\"I would say his tweet doesn't help,\" said Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) who is supporting the compromise bill. \"I just feel like this is an opportunity to get something done and I feel like we owe it to do our part in the House.\"\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said the president was under pressure to back the compromise bill to bring hard-line immigration conservatives like himself on board and was glad to see Mr. Trump push back.\n\n\"The president realized that this is not a bill that we ought to be dying on because it\u2019s time to move on. We\u2019ll get a better bill later,\" he said.\n\nThe compromise immigration bill would provide $23.4 billion for border security\u2014including a wall and surveillance technology\u2014and would cut family-based immigration and eliminate a diversity-visa lottery program. It would also provide six years of legal status to the young immigrants.\n\nThe vote on that plan was delayed on Thursday after rank-and-file House Republicans pressed leaders to make additional changes to the measure. Some conservatives complained that the compromise omitted a requirement that employers use the E-Verify system to check workers' immigration status, while other lawmakers wanted reassurances on how the legislation addressed the parents of Dreamers.\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans have introduced their own, narrow, legislation that focuses on how asylum cases are handled at the border. That bill would codify President Trump's zero-tolerance policy for border crossers and keep families seeking asylum united in detention centers. It would authorize 225 new immigration judges and require the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize resolving family cases. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) are also working on bipartisan legislation.",
    " Title: \"Dennis Prager Challenges Leftist Belief of Conservative Racism with Three Questions\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent column, conservative talk-show host and columnist Dennis Prager questions the labeling of Trump supporters and conservatives as \"racist\" by leftists. Prager argues that this label is a \"big lie\" and presents a challenge to leftists by asking three questions designed to demonstrate the fallacy of this label.\n\nPrager's questions are:\n1. Do you have more in common with, and are you personally more comfortable in the company of, a white leftist or a black conservative?\n2. Would you rather have nine white leftists or nine black conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court?\n3. Would you rather your child marry a black Christian conservative or a white non-Christian liberal?\n\nPrager claims that he has asked these questions of thousands of Trump supporters and has never received answers indicating a preference for white over black, or for a white liberal Supreme Court over a black conservative one. He suggests that these questions can help conservatives come to see the left's charge of conservative racism as a lie, in the same way that the blood libel charge against Jews was a lie.\n\nPrager concludes by stating that conservatives know their responses to these questions are heartfelt and true, and that these questions can help conservatives see the left's charge of conservative racism as a lie. He also notes that his latest book, \"The Rational Bible,\" is a commentary on the book of Exodus, and that he may be contacted at dennisprager.com.",
    " Title: Trump Reverses Campaign Pledge, Says He Will Not Pursue Prosecution of Hillary Clinton\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and joined crowds of his supporters in chants of \"lock her up!\" and said to her face during a debate that if he were president, \"you'd be in jail.\" However, now that he will be president, Trump has stated he will not recommend prosecution of Clinton, who he told New York Times reporters has \"suffered greatly.\"\n\nIn a meeting between the President-elect and reporters and editors at the paper, Trump said, \"I do not want to hurt the Clintons. I really do not. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.\"\n\nThe about-face on his formal rival and the suggestion that the Trump administration will not pursue further investigations of Clinton related to her private email server or the Clinton Foundation first came Tuesday morning from Trump's former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.\n\nConway said Clinton \"still has to face the fact that a majority of Americans do not find her to be honest or trustworthy,\" but added that \"if Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that's a good thing to do.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said it was unusual for a President-elect to take such a public position on whether to pursue an investigation.\n\n\"Even though the attorney general reports to the president, the Department of Justice is meant to exercise a degree of independence from the White House entirely to avoid the perception that political considerations, rather than legal ones, are behind decisions to (or not) prosecute,\" Vladeck said in an email. \"Indeed, we've seen plenty of scandals throughout American history in which presidents have wrongly politicized the Justice Department's role, and President-Elect Trump's comments do not exactly augur well for preservation of the line between law and politics over the next four years.\"\n\nDespite Trump breaking a campaign promise to some of the most fervent anti-Clinton supporters, Democrats also took issue with the decision as a sign of the President-elect's executive overreach.\n\n\"That's not how this works. In our democracy, the President does not decide who gets prosecuted and who does not,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote on Twitter.\n\nDuring Trump's election fight with Clinton, chants of \"lock her up\" - referring to Clinton - became a refrain of the Republican's campaign, as he hammered the Democratic presidential nominee over her decision to use a private email server as secretary of state, and lobbed accusations of corruption and \"pay to play\" politics at the Clinton Foundation. Trump's choice for national security advisor, Michael Flynn, also led a high-profile chant at the Republican National Convention of \"lock her up.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly brought up jailing Clinton on his own, often at raucous campaign rallies over the summer and into the fall. However, in interviews with the Wall Street Journal and CBS' \"60 Minutes\" after the election, Trump refused to say if he would fulfill that commitment to appoint a special prosecutor.\n\n\"I'm going to think about it,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I feel I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on health care, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. And I want to focus on -- all of these other things that we've been talking about.\" He told the program she \"did some bad things\" but added the Clintons are \"good people.\"",
    " Title: San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee Dies at 65\n\nArticle:\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, the city's first Asian-American mayor, passed away early Tuesday at a city hospital at the age of 65, his office announced. Lee had suffered a heart attack while shopping at a Safeway grocery store on Monday night, according to US House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who represents San Francisco in Congress.\n\nLee's office did not release his cause of death. London Breed, president of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, became acting mayor upon Lee's death, the mayor's office said, citing succession rules in the city's charter. Breed is the city's first black female chief executive.\n\nBoard of Supervisors President London Breed has become acting mayor.\n\n\"Our mayor was a good man with a good heart,\" Breed said Tuesday morning. \"He believed above all else in building bridges and solving problems.\"\n\nLee had been expected to conduct meetings Tuesday at City Hall, according to his official schedule. On Monday, he attended a city event promoting a recycling program and was seen smiling and shaking hands, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\n\nBorn in Seattle and the son of Chinese immigrants, Lee graduated from Maine's Bowdoin College in 1974 and earned his law degree at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1978. After becoming a civil rights attorney, he began decades of work in city government in the late 1980s, when he was named investigator for the city's first whistleblower's ordinance.\n\nServing under four mayors, he would become human rights commission director, city purchaser, and public works director. In 2011, the Board of Supervisors appointed Lee, then the city administrator, to fill the rest of the term of Mayor Gavin Newsom, who left to become California's lieutenant governor. Lee was elected to his own term later in 2011 and re-elected in 2015 as mayor of the consolidated city-county government.\n\nLee unabashedly trumpeted San Francisco as a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants and opposed President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at stripping such cities of federal funding. After a US district court judge blocked the order in November, Lee issued a statement saying the city was \"vindicated once again,\" and that San Francisco \"is proud to be a sanctuary city today, tomorrow, and always.\"\n\nPelosi told CNN on Tuesday that Lee was a \"man of the people,\" and that his death was heartbreaking.\n\n\"All who knew Mayor Lee understood him as a true gentleman of great warmth, positivity, and kindness,\" Pelosi said in an official statement. \"His passing is not only a tragic official loss for our city but also a profound personal loss for all who were fortunate enough to call him friend.\"\n\nLaurence M. Baer, the CEO of the San Francisco Giants, saluted Lee's service and called him the professional baseball team's top fan.\n\n\"He was a true San Franciscan who devoted his life to serving our great city and to supporting those most in need,\" Baer said. \"He was the Giants' No. 1 fan, and we are blessed to have shared so many wonderful memories together.\"\n\nVoters will elect someone to fill the rest of Lee's term on June 5, City Attorney Dennis Herrera said. The term expires January 8, 2020. Until the vote, Breed would remain acting mayor unless the board of supervisors decides to replace her with an interim mayor, Herrera said. Breed still retains the board presidency, Herrera said. The board does not have to replace Breed as acting mayor, and the panel had no plans to address the matter on Tuesday, Herrera said.",
    " Title: State Department Delays Release of Hillary Clinton's Daily Meeting Schedules Until After the Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe State Department has announced that it will not release all of Hillary Clinton's daily meeting schedules from her tenure as Secretary of State by the time of the upcoming election. According to the Associated Press (AP), the State Department lawyers have stated that all the schedules will be released by December 30 of this year, but this is more than a month after the country decides upon its next leader.\n\nThe schedules have been in the news this week following the AP's analysis of the available data, which found that most of the meetings with private individuals in the sample involved people who had in some way contributed to the Clinton Foundation. The AP, which initially requested the schedules in 2010 and again in 2013, and then sued the State Department to obtain them, has been criticized by media reporters for publishing its report based on a small data set. The AP analyzed only those meetings with individuals outside the government.\n\nHillary Clinton has responded to the AP's analysis, stating that the meetings were with people she would be proud to meet with to discuss their work and insights. Clinton also noted that whether or not these individuals were going to give money was not a factor in her decision to meet with them. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, criticized the AP for only looking at \"a limited subset\" of the data, arguing that the analysis is flawed because it does not consider the full picture.\n\nJason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, released a statement on Friday, stating, \"It is unacceptable that the State Department is now refusing to release her official schedule before the election in full. Voters deserve to know the truth before they cast their ballots.\"\n\nAccording to the Clinton Foundation's official website, the charity \"convenes businesses, governments, NGOs, and individuals to improve global health and wellness, increase opportunity for girls and women, reduce childhood obesity, create economic opportunity and growth, and help communities address the effects of climate change.\" Bill Clinton stated last week that if Hillary is elected president, the foundation will stop accepting foreign or corporate donations.",
    " Title: Treasury Department Warns of Debt Ceiling Hit in Mid-October\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Treasury Department has announced that it will reach the debt ceiling in the middle of October, marking the end of various short-term deals on the legal debt limit that have been extended since the significant debt ceiling fight in 2011. In a letter to Speaker John Boehner, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated that the government is running out of accounting maneuvers to avoid hitting the borrowing limit. He urged Congress to act promptly to enable the Treasury to continue paying the government's bills.\n\nLew warned that it is impossible to predict the exact date when the borrowing limit will be reached, but he cautioned that if action is not taken soon, the government could be left with approximately $50 billion in cash by mid-October. This amount would not be sufficient to cover Social Security payments, military personnel salaries, Medicare, and other programs for an \"extended period.\"\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center, after the last short-term debt ceiling deal, predicted a similar scenario. Forecasting government cash flows is inherently uncertain, especially many months in advance. Unexpected changes in economic conditions or policy changes could affect the estimate. One unknown factor is whether Freddie Mac will release its $30 billion deferred tax asset, which would result in a larger-than-usual dividend payment to the U.S. Treasury by September 30. However, a $30 billion increase in federal revenues would not be enough to change the BPC's projected \"X-Date\" window.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has signaled a willingness to use the debt ceiling as a negotiating tool for spending cuts, potentially in the mold of a \"grand bargain\" with the White House. President Obama, on the other hand, has repeatedly stated, \"We are not negotiating on the debt ceiling.\"\n\nIn a possible indication that Republicans may not be as serious about trying to extract concessions from Democrats on the debt ceiling, the significant push to defund Obamacare is being tied to a budget resolution rather than the debt ceiling. In general, the debt ceiling is not a matter to be taken lightly - while it is not true that the government would default if we hit the debt ceiling, markets would react as if we did.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Hear Cases on Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court declined on Monday to consider efforts by Republican-led states to defund Planned Parenthood, allowing federal appeals court rulings that allowed the reproductive health organization's patients to contest laws in Louisiana and Kansas that stripped its Medicaid funds.\n\nThe court's refusal to hear the case represents a setback for conservative interest groups in many states that have sought aggressive action against Planned Parenthood and abortion providers in general. Three of the court's conservatives \u2013 Associate Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch \u2013 dissented and said the court should have taken up the issue.\n\nAssociate Justice John Roberts and new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not join the dissent. In a statement, Justice Thomas questioned the court's decision, stating, \"I suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named 'Planned Parenthood.' That makes the court's decision particularly troubling, as the question presented has nothing to do with abortion.\"\n\nSimilar defunding efforts have been blocked in Arizona and Indiana and are being contested in Ohio and Texas. Only in Arkansas has a federal court allowed the state to deny funds. The laws were passed by state legislatures opposed to Planned Parenthood's provision of abortions. Abortions are already denied federal Medicaid funds. The laws blocked funding for other services, from contraception to cancer screenings.\n\nThe federal Medicaid Act allows patients to seek out any qualified provider \u2013 the key word being \"qualified.\" Louisiana and Kansas sought to block Planned Parenthood's funding based on a variety of allegations, including disputed claims that the group sold fetal tissue and body parts for profit.\n\nOpponents of abortion rights expressed disappointment at the high court's inaction, but noted that other cases are percolating in lower courts that could give the justices another chance. Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, said the group \"will continue to fight to protect states from being forced to use their limited public funds to subsidize abortion businesses.\"\n\nDr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, hailed the court's decision to leave lower court rulings alone. \"As a doctor, I have seen what's at stake when people can not access the care they need and when politics gets in the way of people making their own health care choices,\" Wen said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld abortion rights in a series of decisions dating back to 1973. Its most recent ruling struck down restrictions on abortion clinics and providers in Texas two years ago. Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest provider of abortions. More than 2 million women use its clinics for a variety of reproductive services, including many on Medicaid. More than 70 million people \u2013 1 in 5 Americans \u2013 are enrolled in Medicaid.",
    " Title: New Inflammatory Syndrome Affecting Children Emerges Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nA mysterious inflammatory disease, resembling Kawasaki syndrome, has emerged in children, primarily in the United States' coronavirus epicenter, New York. The illness, now known as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, shares common symptoms with Kawasaki syndrome, such as prolonged fever, a rash, conjunctivitis, swelling of the palms or soles of the feet, sometimes peeling of the skin in those areas, and lymph node enlargement.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, warned against rushing to reopen schools in the fall, citing the potential risks of this new illness. He stated that some children with COVID-19 have developed this strange inflammatory syndrome.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo reported that the state is investigating about 100 possible cases of the new disease, which has resulted in at least three deaths. The illness has also been detected in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Britain, and Spain.\n\nDr. Charles Schleien, chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health in New York, reported that his hospital has seen about 40 cases since mid-April, with the majority showing antibodies similar to the coronavirus, indicating they had been infected but had no symptoms of COVID-19. Several others tested positive for the virus and did not exhibit symptoms either.\n\nThough a causal connection between the virus and the new illness has yet to be proven, Schleien stated, \"The relationship seems pretty strong.\" He added, \"We never see these many kids with Kawasaki. Usually, we'll see a few kids a year. We won't see three dozen over a period of a few weeks. So, given the numbers and given the fact it's not acting exactly like Kawasaki, it looks like it's probably a post-COVID-19 infection inflammatory disease.\"\n\nOne difference from Kawasaki, which typically affects children under 5 years old, is the age range for this disease, which extends into adolescence. Schleien reported seeing cases in minors as old as 14.\n\nThe good news is that, like Kawasaki disease, almost all the kids are treatable, usually with intravenous immunoglobulin and sometimes steroids, followed by aspirin. Hospital stays for patients may last two to four days. Parents are advised to check with a physician or take their children to an emergency room if their fever persists for more than two to three days, especially if some of the other symptoms appear, including a rapid heartbeat.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is studying the rare disease and does not have statistics about its incidence. The CDC plans to send out an alert in the next couple of days, asking doctors to be on the lookout for the syndrome.\n\nResearchers from the U.K., where a few dozen cases of the syndrome have been reported, participated in a webinar discussing the case. They noted that children who had COVID-19 symptoms did not show signs of the new disease. However, children who remained asymptomatic despite being in a family with several infected and sick members developed the inflammatory response a week or two later.\n\nDr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford University, hosted a webinar addressing the case on Friday as scientists try to find out whether the virus precipitates the syndrome. Maldonado stated, \"The question is, will this be something to look out for in children over time? It may be that it's another inflammatory reaction, like we're seeing in adults who have inflammation of their lungs. It seems like this virus triggers in some people a really intense inflammatory response.\"\n\nMaldonado emphasized the rarity of the syndrome and the importance of practicing social distancing and encouraging it on children. She also reminded parents that the syndrome is real and not a made-up disease.",
    " Title: Senate Silences Elizabeth Warren During Debate on Jeff Sessions' Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the United States Senate, primarily Republicans, silenced Senator Elizabeth Warren during a debate on the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. The incident occurred when Warren read a letter written by Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., opposing Sessions' nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986.\n\nThe incident took place during a debate on Sessions' nomination, which is expected to be confirmed in a vote on Wednesday. Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, read from King's letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, stating, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge.\"\n\nRepublicans accused Warren of violating Senate rules against impugning another senator. A vote along party lines upheld the decision, turning what could have been an ordinary partisan floor speech into a national story. Warren later told CNN's Don Lemon, \"They can shut me up, but they can't change the truth.\"\n\nThe incident immediately galvanized the Democratic base, providing a new rallying point following the women's marches around the country. The silencing of Warren, who was attempting to read a letter from a civil rights icon, was seen as a hypocritical move by some, as her male colleagues were able to read from the letter uninterrupted. Senators Tom Udall of New Mexico and Jeff Merkley were allowed to read from King's letter, though they couched their remarks as only reading portions of the letter and with the context to be in line with Senate rules.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended invoking Rule 19, a rarely used chamber regulation that prohibits senators from impugning each other. Warren is now forbidden from participating in the floor debate over Sessions' nomination.\n\nThe incident comes at a crucial time for Warren, who is up for re-election in 2018. On Tuesday, she announced she hired an aide who is an expert on national security, a move that could help burnish her expertise in that area, as well as the publication of a new book, which will become available in April.\n\nLiberals had been frustrated with Warren's vote in committee in favor of Ben Carson, Trump's nominee for secretary of Housing and Urban Development. By Tuesday night, the hashtag #LetLizSpeak was trending on Twitter, and millions of people had watched on Facebook as Warren read the letter outside the Senate chamber. MoveOn members contributed $250,000 to Warren's re-election campaign in about 12 hours.\n\nWarren took to social media to express her frustration, writing, \"I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system.\" In a follow-up tweet, she said, \"I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.\"\n\nThe incident has become a rallying cry for fellow Democrats, with Senators Kamala Harris, Patrick Leahy, and Chuck Schumer speaking out against the decision to silence Warren. The Senate has descended into a series of complaints about declining decorum on both sides.",
    " Title: Henry Kissinger Expresses Optimism for Trump's Foreign Policy Opportunities\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, has expressed optimism about President-elect Donald Trump's potential influence on the international community. In an interview on \"Face the Nation,\" Kissinger stated that Trump's presidency could present an \"extraordinary opportunity\" for the nation and its foreign relations.\n\nKissinger acknowledged that Trump's unconventional rhetoric and lack of political experience raised concerns during his campaign. However, he commended Trump for his ability to navigate the political landscape and secure the presidency despite opposition from his own party.\n\n\"In the first appearances, I thought it was a transitory phenomenon,\" Kissinger said. \"But I give him huge credit for having analyzed an aspect of the American situation, developed a strategy, carried it out against the leadership of his own party, and prevailed.\"\n\nKissinger believes that Trump could apply the same skills he used to win the presidency to shape a foreign policy plan. He noted that Trump's unexpected victory and the subsequent transition period have created a \"partial vacuum\" and \"new questions\" that could lead to \"something remarkable and new\" in international relations.\n\nHowever, Kissinger also expressed hope that Trump would modify his tone, particularly when addressing complex issues like the relationship between the U.S. and China, which he believes has the potential to be mutually beneficial if managed properly.\n\n\"I think he operates by a kind of instinct that is a different form of analysis as my more academic one,\" Kissinger said. \"But he's raised a number of issues that I think are important, very important. And if they're addressed properly, could lead to good \u2014 great results.\"\n\nThe international community is now grappling with the reality of Trump as the world leader, as many nations reassess their relationships in light of his unconventional approach and policies. Kissinger's comments suggest that the Trump administration's foreign policy could deviate significantly from previous administrations, potentially leading to new and unprecedented developments in international relations.",
    " Title: RNC Chairman Threatens Non-Supportive Republicans with Potential Party Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has threatened Republican politicians who refuse to support the party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, suggesting that the party may take steps to impede their future electoral prospects. In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Mr. Priebus stated that every Republican who ran in the 2016 election needs to back Mr. Trump.\n\nThose who have not, including Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, could face diminished support from the party moving forward, according to Mr. Priebus.\n\n\"People who agreed to support the nominee, that took part in our process, they used tools from the RNC. They agreed to support the nominee. They took part in our process. We\u2019re a private party, we\u2019re not a public entity. Those people need to get on board,\" Mr. Priebus said.\n\n\"And if they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re going to run again someday, I think we\u2019re going to evaluate our process, the nomination process, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy for them,\" he added.\n\nGovernor Kasich has stated it is \"very unlikely\" he will vote for Mr. Trump, while former Governor Bush and Senator Cruz have expressed similar sentiments. Mr. Cruz notably withheld an endorsement of Mr. Trump during the Republican National Convention and instead urged Republicans to \"vote their conscience\" in November.\n\nMr. Priebus denied that he was threatening Mr. Kasich, Mr. Cruz, or anyone else, yet he clearly suggested the party would put roadblocks in front of the electoral hopes of anyone who hasn't offered a full-throated endorsement of Mr. Trump.\n\n\"People in our party are talking about what we\u2019re going to do about this... It\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s just a question,\" the RNC chairman said. \"What should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?\"\n\nGovernor Kasich, a former 2016 GOP presidential candidate himself, emphasized the importance of getting out the vote for Republicans like Senator Rob Portman, who is running for re-election in Ohio.\n\n\"We want to get people out to vote. We want to re-elect Senator Portman, and we want to re-elect people down ticket,\" Mr. Kasich said. \"I\u2019m not voting for Hillary [Clinton].\"\n\n\"I\u2019ll let everybody know... but I think my actions have spoken very loudly. Louder than even my words,\" he added.\n\nGovernor Kasich was in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention in July but did not attend the convention itself. When asked about Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Mr. Kasich said, \"I haven\u2019t even gone there yet. It\u2019s a long way [until] Election Day.\"",
    " Title: Trump Claims \"Total and Complete Vindication\" Following Comey's Testimony, Accuses Former FBI Director of Lying and Leaking\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump broke his silence on Friday regarding former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before Congress, claiming \"total and complete vindication\" while appearing to accuse Comey of lying and labeling him a \"leaker.\"\n\n\"Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication... and WOW, Comey is a leaker!\" Trump wrote on Twitter just after 6 a.m. on Friday.\n\nThe accusation, essentially alleging that Comey committed perjury in his congressional testimony, is just the latest broadside Trump has launched against his former FBI director. However, it is not expected to be the last.\n\nThe tweet also raised eyebrows in the White House, with at least two senior White House aides expressing surprise Friday morning at the president's missive slamming Comey.\n\nThe president's tweet is just one part of the counteroffensive against Comey. A person close to Trump's outside legal team confirmed on Friday that it will aim to file a complaint next week with the Department of Justice inspector general about the so-called leak, in which Comey handed off memos describing his conversations with Trump to a friend who in turn passed them onto The New York Times.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, was immediately criticized for the move, which followed a bellicose statement on Thursday in which Kasowitz, too, accused Comey of lying under oath and inappropriately disclosing the contents of his conversations with Trump.\n\n\"This is an abuse of process & we will be filing a defense of Comey. @marckasowitz beware: there r serious consequences for abuse of process,\" former Obama ethics adviser Norm Eisen wrote on Twitter Friday.\n\nTrump, however, has a long history of threatening legal action but failing to follow through.\n\nThe president on Thursday managed to stay quiet on Twitter throughout Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, in which the former director himself accused the president of lying and told lawmakers that it was \"the nature of the person\" he was dealing with that compelled him to take copious, contemporaneous notes to protect against the possibility that Trump might later \"lie about the nature of our meeting.\"\n\nAnd while Comey did verify Trump's past statement that he assured the president he was not personally under investigation, what Comey provided Trump was far from \"complete vindication.\"\n\nComey, while declining to directly say whether he thought Trump tried to obstruct justice, nevertheless testified that he believed Trump directed him to shut down a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and fired him with the intent of changing the course of the larger Russia investigation.\n\nTrump's team has been quick to push back, and a main thrust of their strategy is to discredit Comey, painting him as disgruntled and untrustworthy. The process began with an RNC-coordinated counter-messaging effort, and was followed by Kasowitz's prepared statement at the National Press Club, near the White House.\n\nThe president upped the ante on Friday morning with his tweet. However, the defense of Trump has been inconsistent. While Trump and Kasowitz have directly refuted the substance of Comey's accounts, many of Trump's fellow Republicans sought to frame it as a misinterpretation by Comey rather than a total fabrication.\n\n\"The president's new at this. He's new at government,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday. \"He's not steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses.\"\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a staunch Trump ally, defended Trump by saying the Flynn discussion was \"normal New York City conversation.\"\n\nTrump's allies are also eager to shift the conversation to Comey's conduct. While White House officials were largely absent from the morning TV news circuit, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski made the president's case in three separate appearances on ABC, NBC, and Fox News. Lewandowski worked to thread a difficult needle, emphasizing Comey's statement that Trump had never been under investigation while at the same time calling into question the FBI director's credibility to dispute other portions of his testimony.\n\nLewandowski criticized Comey for relaying his notes from meetings with the president to the media through an intermediary, suggesting that the former director should be prosecuted if such a move was part of a regular pattern of behavior. Lewandowski also mocked Comey, telling NBC's \"Today\" show that the former director had used a go-between to share his memos \"because he was not man enough to give the notes directly to the media when he wanted them out to the media.\"\n\nAnd while Trump has suggested that he might be in possession of recordings of his meetings with Comey\u2014recordings that the former director said Thursday he would like the president to release if they exist\u2014Lewandowski said he did not know if such tapes exist because he does not work in the White House. Regardless, he said on NBC, \"I think Jim Comey's credibility is at about zero right now.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, appearing on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" said the president's behavior with Comey was \"certainly inappropriate\" and \"an abuse of power\" but she stopped short of discussing impeachment, a topic she said she has urged her Democratic colleagues to approach carefully and only if they have the facts behind them.\n\n\"In terms of obstruction of justice, I think there's reason to believe and Mueller should look into this,\" she said. \"It's certainly, in the court of public opinion, very incriminating.\"\n\nTrump is also expected to address the controversy further when he holds a joint news conference with the president of Romania on Friday afternoon in the Rose Garden.",
    " Title: ISIS Takes Control of Ramadi, Highlighting Weakness of Iraqi Military and Dependence on Allies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, ISIS forces have taken control of the Iraqi city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, marking the biggest victory for the militant group in Iraq in nearly a year. The fall of Ramadi underscores the fundamental weakness of the Iraqi military and its deep reliance on radical Shia militias.\n\nThe city's loss to ISIS is noteworthy beyond just Ramadi. The militant group has been unusually successful in Anbar province, a predominantly Sunni region, where it has blocked Iraqi army attacks and at times advanced despite setbacks in other parts of the country. The balance in Anbar has been shifting in favor of ISIS, as the fall of Ramadi demonstrates.\n\nThe Iraqi military contingent in Ramadi has been under-resourced for over a year. As reported by Liz Sly, the Washington Post's Beirut bureau chief, Iraqi troops had held out in Ramadi for 16 months with little help before succumbing. The Iraqi army's core problem lies in its profound weakness due to corruption and mass defections during last June's ISIS offensive. It lacks enough effective, battle-hardened units to take on ISIS independently.\n\nEven an Iraqi elite special forces unit, the Golden Division, was defeated in Ramadi because it is \"a small force stretched over a dozen battlefields, fighting nonstop for a year,\" according to Michael Knights, the Lafer fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nThis fundamental weakness forces the Iraqi army to rely on allies, such as the Kurdish peshmerga in the north and violent sectarian Shia militias in the rest of the country. Together, their combined forces are stronger than ISIS, with both the Kurds and the militias proving effective against ISIS on the battlefield. However, the factions are also at odds with one another.\n\nISIS's victory in Ramadi did not change the fundamentals of the conflict. ISIS remains outnumbered, surrounded by enemies, vulnerable to American airstrikes, and facing increasingly competent enemies. The anti-ISIS campaign will likely have more setbacks, and the fighting will continue to devastate Iraq and potentially deepen the Sunni-Shia divides that gave rise to ISIS in the first place. Even with ISIS's fundamental weakness, Iraq remains in a very bad place.",
    " Title: Private Prison Companies See Profit in Trump's Immigration Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced plans to expand the capacity of immigrant detention centers in the United States, potentially leading to a need for additional facilities if the administration intends to carry out its proposed mass deportation of millions of undocumented residents. This development has sparked nationwide outrage among many, but one group seemingly welcoming the expansion is private prison companies.\n\nAs of November, approximately 65% of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees are housed in facilities operated by private prison companies. These corporations typically earn a fee per detainee per night, and their business model relies on minimizing costs to maximize profits for their shareholders. Since President Trump's election, private prison stocks have surged, and two new for-profit detention centers are set to open in Georgia and Texas.\n\nMoreover, a private prison company, Management & Training Corp., is reportedly seeking a contract with ICE to reopen the Willacy County Correctional Institution, a troubled detention camp that housed up to 2,000 ICE detainees in Kevlar tents between 2006 and 2011. According to George Takei, a well-known activist, \"Historically, ICE has relied heavily on the private prison industry every time the detention system has expanded. There's little doubt in my mind that they will continue to rely on the private prison industry in what's going to be the biggest expansion of the agency in history.\"\n\nThe expansion of private detention facilities under the Trump administration could potentially lead to increased profits, with the more aggressive the administration's immigration policies, the larger the detention centers may become. It is important to note that running a private prison company is not focused on providing humane conditions. While those being rounded up may be guilty of overstaying their visas or similar offenses, they may find themselves in private detention facilities that have been terminated by other federal agencies due to patterns of abuse and neglect in the past.",
    " Title: Scalia Criticizes Obama's Immigration Policies, Questions Framers' Response\n\nArticle:\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia suggested on Monday that the Framers of the U.S. Constitution would have reacted negatively to President Barack Obama's recent decision not to enforce certain immigration laws. In a dissenting opinion on the court's ruling on Arizona's SB 1070 immigration law, Scalia criticized the Obama administration's new policy of ending deportations for many young adults who entered the country illegally.\n\nScalia questioned whether states would have joined the union if the Constitution included a clause enacting immigration laws but allowed the president to choose whether to enforce them. He suggested that the Framers would have left Independence Hall if presented with such a clause.\n\nScalia argued that Arizona, by passing a state immigration law, was protecting its sovereignty, not contradicting federal law but complying with it. However, he expressed concern that the court's decision to strike down most of the key provisions of Arizona's SB 1070 immigration law could limit Arizona's ability to enforce immigration laws.\n\nThe court upheld a key piece of the Arizona law, requiring police to check the immigration status of those they arrest or stop for questioning, but struck down other pieces of the law, arguing that the state had stepped into the bounds of federal law. Scalia criticized the court's decision, stating that it was illogical for Arizona to be accused of contradicting federal law by enforcing immigration laws that the president declines to enforce.\n\nScalia also criticized the Obama administration's policies, stating that the problem Arizona faces is not the allocation of resources for enforcing immigration laws elsewhere, but the administration's policies. He expressed concern that the new Department of Homeland Security directives would require as many as 1.4 million background checks and biennial rulings on requests for dispensation, which would consume scarce enforcement resources.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Bitter Choices as September Deadlines Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican lawmakers are facing a challenging month as they may be required to vote on two contentious issues by the end of September: a continuing resolution to keep the government open and funded at current spending levels, and a bill to raise the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling increase, another measure that is unpopular among congressional conservatives, is likely to be tied to the continuing resolution.\n\nThe government faces a September 30 deadline to prevent a shutdown, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has set a September 29 deadline for raising the nation's borrowing limit. Mnuchin has stated that the hike should be \"clean,\" meaning it should not be tied to spending cuts or reforms demanded by conservatives.\n\nTo get the bill through the Senate, Republicans will need support from Democrats, giving the minority leverage. Republicans typically oppose funding the government with a continuing resolution because it blocks or postpones their priorities, including funds for President Trump's border wall, significant increases in military spending, and cuts to nondefense discretionary spending.\n\nRepublicans could avoid the continuing resolution by reaching a deal on a broader spending bill, but that would also require Democratic support in the Senate, and time is running out. So far, the House has only managed to approve four spending bills, while the Senate has not approved any, and most have not even made it out of committee. This means the continuing resolution is a more likely outcome and one that would buy time for a longer budget deal at the end of the year.\n\nSeveral prominent conservative leaders have expressed resignation to a continuing resolution as House members began their recess last week. \"September is going to be a very difficult month,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. \"I think that there is no way to work quick enough to do a normal appropriations process, so a CR will be the result, because of inactivity in the Senate.\"\n\nCongress will still be under pressure this fall to secure a spending deal even with a continuing resolution. New budget caps under a previous long-term budget deal are set to kick in in January, which would reduce spending below existing levels unless Congress passes a new law.\n\nRaising the borrowing limit is a difficult vote for most members of Congress, but particularly for Republicans. A Harvard\u2013Harris Poll in June found that an astonishing 69 percent of voters were opposed to Congress raising the debt ceiling, even though the failure to do so could lead the United States to default on its debt. Under former President Barack Obama, conservatives tried to use the must-pass legislation to get spending reforms or other Republican priorities made into law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling both the House and Senate, however, the dynamics have shifted. Democrats may try to turn the tables and extract concessions from Republicans, who will need Democratic support to pass the debt ceiling.",
    " Title: PG&E Initiates Largest Power Outage in California History to Prevent Wildfires\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of thousands of residents in California faced a power outage on Wednesday as Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) initiated a series of power cuts to prevent wildfires. The utility company reported that over 500,000 customers in Northern California were affected, with plans to cut power to nearly 800,000 customers in total. A second group of approximately 234,000 customers will lose power starting at noon.\n\nPG&E plans to shut off power in parts of 34 northern, central, and coastal California counties to reduce the risk of trees falling onto power lines during hot, windy weather. Gusts of 56 to 72kph (35-45 mph) are forecast to sweep across the state, affecting areas from the San Francisco Bay area to the agricultural Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills, where a November wildfire in 2018, blamed on PG&E transmission lines, resulted in 85 fatalities and the near-total destruction of the town of Paradise.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention has increased staffing in preparation for extreme fire weather. The winds are expected to be the strongest and most widespread the region has seen in two years. Given the scope of the danger, PG&E stated that this was a necessary precaution, with Sumeet Singh, head of the utility's Community Wildfire Safety Program, describing it as a \"last resort.\"\n\nHowever, Governor Gavin Newsom expressed dissatisfaction, stating, \"No one is satisfied with this, no one is happy with this.\" He emphasized the need for PG&E to upgrade and fix its equipment to prevent widespread outages in the future. PG&E estimates that it could take up to five days to restore power after the danger has passed, as every inch of power line must be checked to ensure it is not damaged or in danger of sparking a blaze.\n\nThe outages were not limited to fire-prone areas, as the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires. Classes were cancelled for thousands of schoolchildren and at universities such as the University of California, Berkeley, Sonoma State University, and Mills College. The California Department of Transportation is installing generators to avoid closing the Caldecott Tunnel linking the East Bay to San Francisco and the Tom Lantos Tunnel on State Route 1 in Pacifica.\n\nResidents in affected areas are advised to have supplies of water for several days, to keep sensitive medicines such as insulin in cool places, to drive carefully because traffic lights could be out, to have a full gas tank for emergencies, and to check the food in freezers and refrigerators for spoilage after power is restored. PG&E has set up about 30 community centers offering air conditioning, restrooms, bottled water, and electronic charging stations during daylight hours.\n\nEast Bay Municipal Utility District, serving Alameda and Contra Costa counties, recently spent $409,000 to rent 29 backup generators for use beginning at noon on Wednesday. The backup generators are stationed at the pumping plants, which pump water to the fire hydrants. Counties have activated their emergency centers, and authorities urge people to be prepared.",
    " Title: Obama's Re-election and the Future of American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe re-election of President Barack Obama for a second term in the United States has sparked discussions about the nation's political landscape and the role of government in American society. The election results reflect a divided nation, with half of the country supporting Obama's policies and the other half expressing dissent.\n\nObama's re-election, according to some analysts, is a testament to the historical observation made by Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton that the public may elect leaders who promote dependency over self-reliance when the public treasury is perceived as a public trough. This trend, they argue, has been a feature of American politics since the presidencies of Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, FDR, and LBJ, and is now a common characteristic of both modern-day Democrats and contemporary Republicans.\n\nMitt Romney, a Republican, is one of those who promised to maintain existing federal entitlements, which currently cost taxpayers approximately $1.7 trillion per year. Under Obama's administration, the costs have increased, as have the number of recipients.\n\nPresident Obama's second term is expected to bring significant changes, with the implementation of ObamaCare and an increase in the national debt. The federal government's debt is projected to reach $20 trillion, leading to an estimated $1 trillion in annual interest payments if the Republican-controlled House of Representatives continues to support Obama's policies, as it did during his first term. Additionally, the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts on New Year's Day will result in increased taxes for many Americans.\n\nThe election results and the policies that follow have sparked concerns about the future of American politics, with some expressing apprehension about the potential for increased government intervention in private lives and the economy. Critics argue that Obama's policies reflect an expansive view of the federal government, which may lead to the creation of a European-style welfare state and the subordination of the individual to the state at every turn.\n\nIn conclusion, the re-election of President Obama for a second term marks a significant shift in the American political landscape, with many anticipating increased government intervention in the economy and personal lives. The election results and the policies that follow have sparked debates about the role of government in American society and the potential for a European-style welfare state.",
    " Title: Wisconsin's Political Dichotomy: A Study of its Schizophrenic Political Personality\n\nArticle:\n\nMadison, Wis. \u2014 Wisconsin, a state known for its idyllic landscapes between two lakes, has long been a subject of fascination and perplexity for its politically diverse history. The state has been the home of Robert \"Fighting Bob\" La Follette, a populist senator and Progressive Party presidential candidate in 1924, and Joseph McCarthy, the hard-line conservative senator behind the Communist witch-hunts of the 1950s.\n\nThis political disparity is not limited to the past. In 1973, civil rights and anti-Vietnam War activist Paul Soglin, a self-proclaimed \"radical\" at the time, was elected mayor of Madison. He succeeded William Dyke, an ultra-conservative who was Lester Maddox's running-mate on the American Independent Party's presidential ticket in 1976. Soglin, incidentally, is mayor again today.\n\nThe current U.S. senators, Ron Johnson (Republican) and Tammy Baldwin (Democrat), represent the widest ideological gulf of any state's senators, according to a 2013 National Journal ranking of voting records. Baldwin, the Senate's first openly gay member, was listed as the 5th most liberal; Johnson the 9th most conservative.\n\nRutgers University political science professor Ross Baker observes, \"Wisconsin defies political trends. It doesn't swing, it pivots.\" This political dichotomy is instructive as another native son, Gov. Scott Walker, makes a run for the Republican presidential nomination next year, casting himself as Ronald Reagan's natural heir.\n\nPart of Walker's compelling storyline is his ability to win two elections as governor and survive a recall election in a swing state with such a strong liberal tradition. Wisconsin's electorate has a history of electing liberal politicians, such as William Proxmire, a liberal and early anti-Vietnam war opponent who replaced McCarthy following the Red-baiting senator's death, and Democrat Russ Feingold, the champion of campaign finance changes until he got knocked off by Johnson in 2010.\n\nMichael Wagner, a political science and journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agrees that the state's politics \"look pretty schizophrenic to people on the outside \u2014 and the inside, too.\" Wagner attributes this political polarization to long-standing divisions among voters, with a very small swing vote deciding whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat wins.\n\nLike most states, midterm elections favor Republicans because their loyal voters, namely whites, turn out in higher proportions than Democratic voters, mainly minorities who are more likely to show up in presidential years. Wagner notes that Walker and Johnson won their races in midterm election cycles, while Baldwin won in 2012, when President Obama topped the ticket.\n\nWisconsin is one of the least diverse states in the nation, with whites accounting for 88% of the population. Yet, with such a narrowly divided electorate, that small minority vote\u2014or its absence\u2014can swing an election.\n\nPolitical scientist Wagner notes that both sides have gotten very good at winning elections. The loser: consensus politics that serve the greater good. \"Compromise is not possible with such polarization,\" he says.\n\nSuch a bitter divide means politicians elected to statewide office wind up representing the interests of those that got 'em there, the greater good of the state be damned. This is the chilling takeaway for Washington, and it explains why so little has been accomplished in recent years in the nation's capital. Compromise is a dirty word. It's all about winning, now.",
    " Title: The Lack of Political Guardrails: A Look at the Current Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article, Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal highlighted the apparent lack of political guardrails in today's political climate, using the metaphor of physical guardrails on treacherous roads to illustrate the need for constraints on political power.\n\nStrassel's piece points to the actions of prominent politicians, such as former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who have bypassed legislative processes to implement their desired policies. Obama, for instance, unilaterally altered the Affordable Care Act, and Clinton has promised to impose gun control laws and new taxes if Congress does not support her proposals.\n\nThe public's response to such actions, according to Strassel, is a preference for a strong, decisive leader who will take control and make things better, regardless of constitutional restraints. This trend is also evident in the rise of Donald Trump, whose controversial statements and promises have garnered him support.\n\nHowever, the article argues that the Constitution was written to limit political authority, with the intention of leaving individual Americans to their own devices and creating a free and prosperous nation. The author expresses concern that both major parties are off the rails, with some Republicans demanding an IRS audit of the Clinton Foundation and Congress quietly reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, a subsidy for corporations that undermines free-market principles.\n\nThe article concludes by lamenting the lack of humble, constitutional candidates and the overshadowing of important government reform by sensational, unconstitutional actions. The author calls for a return to the principles of the Constitution and a focus on constitutional guardrails in politics.",

The survey, a joint effort by Republican pollster Ed Goeas and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, was discussed by both strategists at a Monitor-hosted breakfast for reporters on Monday.\n\nEd Goeas, of the Tarrance Group, a Republican campaign consulting firm, stated that the Battleground survey found that 73 percent of voters believe the country is on the wrong track. Celinda Lake of Lake Research Partners noted that, according to those surveyed, \"the No. 1 problem in the country is the dysfunction in Washington.\" This problem is rated higher now than jobs and the economy combined.\n\nWhen voters were asked to rate the job Congress is doing, 87 percent said they disapprove versus just 9 percent who approve. Voters also blame their own Congressperson for the gridlock, with 50 percent disapproving of how their own member of Congress is doing versus 39 percent who approved and 11 percent who were unsure.\n\nRepublicans in Congress had worse ratings than Democrats, according to the survey. Sixty-five percent of those polled had an unfavorable view of Republicans in Congress, while Democrats were viewed unfavorably by 53 percent. The government shutdown last month played a role in these numbers, both strategists said.\n\nIn the poll taken almost a month after a government shutdown largely driven by the demands of tea party activists, only 54 percent of those polled said they had an unfavorable impression of the tea party \u2013 11 points lower than the disapproval level for Republicans and a statistical dead heat with Democrats.\n\nWhile Republicans in Congress have reason to be concerned about their standing, this latest poll also contains bad news for President Obama. His approval rating now stands at 44 percent, with 52 percent disapproving. Obama's personal ratings are also down, with 47 percent of those surveyed saying they had a favorable view of him and 50 percent holding unfavorable views.\n\nThis is the first time in the Battleground survey that Obama has had both a majority unfavorable image and majority disapproval of his job performance, Goeas says. \"The key question... is has Barack Obama lost the ability to lead in this country,\" Goeas stated. Goeas also noted that, in a second term of the White House, once a president's numbers decline, they never come back up, and once a president loses the trust of the American people in the second term, they never gain it back. He suggested that the ongoing health care issues could lead to Obama losing the trust of the American people.",
    " Title: White House and Congress Debate Corporate Tax Rate in Proposed U.S. Tax Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - President Donald Trump's recent remarks about a potential 22% corporate tax rate in the upcoming tax legislation have sparked debate within the U.S. Congress. The proposed tax bills, passed separately by the Senate and the House of Representatives, aim to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20%, but differ in other areas that Republicans are trying to merge into final legislation.\n\nOn Saturday, after the Senate approved its tax bill, Trump stated that the corporate tax rate in the final legislation \"could be 22%...it could also be 20%.\" This remark has piqued the interest of some Republicans who see a slight increase in the proposed corporate tax rate as a potential source of federal revenue to address other issues within the legislation.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, who is expected to head a bicameral House-Senate negotiating committee, stated, \"The 20 percent rate ought to be our goal.\" However, Brady also noted that no decision has been made on whether a higher corporate tax rate is needed.\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Marc Short stated on Thursday that Trump was not expressing support for a higher corporate tax rate. Instead, Short suggested that Trump may have been reflecting conversations he had with Republican senators.\n\n\"I think he was just reflecting what conversations he had heard from them, but that... wasn't intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate,\" Short said.\n\nThe White House and Republicans have a significant stake in the outcome of the tax overhaul, as it has not been achieved since 1986. A successful tax overhaul would provide Republicans with their first major legislative victory of 2017, following their failure to overturn former President Barack Obama's healthcare law. Without a win, Republicans fear they could lose their control of the House and Senate in the 2018 congressional elections.\n\nHowever, it may be too late to avoid confusion over priorities as the tax debate moves forward in Congress. Lobbyists stated that many perceive that Trump and his advisers would accept a corporate rate higher than 20%.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Kevin Hassett stated on Thursday that a 22% corporate rate would not undermine the economic boost that Republicans claim tax cuts will create. Analysts suggest that the corporate income tax rate could be a ready source of revenue for lawmakers, as they move toward a final bill that can lose no more than $1.5 trillion in revenue over the next decade under Senate rules.\n\nRepublicans are considering a more costly deduction for state and local taxes than the $10,000 property tax deduction contained in the House and Senate bills. One version would allow taxpayers to choose a $10,000 deduction for either property or income taxes.\n\nHouse lawmakers also want to adopt the House bill's repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, which would cost about $40 billion in revenue over a decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Senate retained the tax.\n\nA House limit on the amount of debt interest payments that businesses can deduct from their income would also cost about $136 billion more than the Senate version, the JCT said. Analysts suggest that a one percentage point change in the corporate rate equals about $100 billion in revenues over a decade.",
    " Title: President Trump Announces Immediate Negotiations on Border Security Measures Following Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Saturday that negotiations with congressional Democrats over border security measures will commence immediately following the end of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. The shutdown, which lasted 35 days, ended on Friday when Trump signed a bill to fund the government until February 15.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump stated, \"Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!\"\n\nThe president signaled that he plans to use a new caravan of Central American migrants approaching the U.S.-Mexico border as justification for his proposed wall. Trump tweeted, \"If we had a powerful Wall, they wouldn\u2019t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall!\"\n\nTrump had tweeted seven times before 10 a.m. ET, including five times on border security, once on Roger Stone being indicted for lying to Congress, and another on the RNC pledging support for the president in 2020.\n\nLater on Saturday, Trump tweeted, \"Only fools, or people with a political agenda, don\u2019t want a Wall or Steel Barrier to protect our Country from Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking. It will happen - it always does!\"\n\nIn a tweet late on Friday, the president stated, \"I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall. This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it\u2019s off to the races!\"",
    " Title: Jared Kushner Takes Central Role in White House Coronavirus Response Efforts, Draws Criticism for Lack of Public Health Expertise\n\nArticle:\n\nJared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, criticized governors on Thursday, stating they lack control over their own supplies of masks and ventilators needed to combat the coronavirus outbreak. In a rare appearance in the White House briefing room, Kushner urged governors and some senators to be more resourceful in their own states instead of relying on the federal government for help.\n\nKushner, a real estate executive with no public health expertise, generally works behind the scenes at the White House. His role in the administration's efforts to confront the coronavirus pandemic has drawn scrutiny, especially when he referred to the national stockpile of medical supplies as \"our stockpile.\"\n\nKushner has emerged with a central role working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to oversee the distribution of vital medical supplies to hospital and health care providers. On Thursday, he explained that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence came to him looking for new ideas and \"outside-the-box\" thinking.\n\nHowever, Kushner's lack of experience has drawn scrutiny, especially when he referred to the national stockpile of medical supplies as \"our stockpile.\"\n\n\"The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile,\" he said. \"It's not supposed to be states' stockpiles that they then use.\"\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, told NPR's Here & Now that she disagreed with Kushner's statement. \"That is absolutely not the way it is supposed to work,\" she said. \"The national stockpile was supposed to be a backup for states\u2014and that the Trump administration should have done more to fill it.\"\n\nA day after Kushner made his remarks, language on a government website about the national stockpile was changed to more closely reflect his description. However, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department had been using the new language for weeks. The assistant secretary for preparedness and response \"first began working to update the website text a week ago to more clearly explain to state and local agencies and members of the public the role of the 'Strategic National Stockpile,'\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhen asked Friday about his son-in-law's remarks, Trump said Kushner was \"talking about our country.\"\n\n\"We need it for the government and the federal government,\" he said, complaining that state governments should have had their own stockpiles. \"The federal government needs it, too, not just the states,\" he said.\n\nPart of Kushner's strength is his proximity to the president. He has been his father-in-law's point man on issues as diverse as the Middle East peace process, immigration, and now the response to the coronavirus. The real estate developer and scion of the Kushner family, which operates the Kushner Companies, is well-connected\u2014and he's using those connections, working with FEMA and the U.S. military, to get things where they need to be with the response to the outbreak.\n\nAs he recounted Thursday, the president had called him earlier that morning about reports he was hearing about critical shortages in the New York public hospital system. Kushner called Dr. Mitchell Katz, who runs the system, asked him which supply was the most critical, and arranged for the necessary supplies to be sent.\n\nHowever, some experts question Kushner's lack of experience overseeing the response to emergencies of this scale. Craig Fugate, who ran FEMA during the Obama administration, said the federal government can't base decisions on requests. The coronavirus is moving so fast that states can't keep up.\n\n\"My experience in disasters is the burn rate is always greater than what anybody anticipates,\" he said. \"And if we had waited for states to identify their needs, we were always behind and not there fast enough.\"\n\nThere are also concerns raised by ethics groups who contend that Kushner's role in the response is akin to overseeing a shadow task force with no oversight. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement, \"If there was ever a time we need records and transparency, this is it. The public needs to understand who in the White House is making policy decisions, who from private industry is influencing those decisions, and how decisions to address this pandemic are being made.\"\n\nHowever, Andy Slavitt, the Obama-era administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, calls the current crisis an all-hands-on-deck effort. He appreciates Kushner or anyone else in government sharing their expertise. But he does say roles need to be clear and execution much more coordinated.\n\n\"The issue should be, we don't need five generals,\" he said. \"We need somebody in charge.\" He said the military is best poised to lead that effort.",
    " Title: Obama Meets Orlando Nightclub Shooting Survivors, Urges Gun Control Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama met with survivors of the Orlando nightclub shooting and relatives of the 49 victims on Thursday, expressing his condolences and urging Congress to take action on gun control and countering homegrown terrorism.\n\nDuring the meeting, Obama laid flowers at a memorial for the victims of the attack on the Pulse nightclub. The shooting, carried out by a U.S.-born gunman, Omar Mateen, on Sunday, is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nMateen, a U.S. citizen born in New York to Afghan immigrants, was killed by police after a three-hour standoff inside the nightclub. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but U.S. officials have stated that Mateen was not assisted from abroad.\n\nAccording to reports, Mateen exchanged text messages with his wife during the attack, as well as posting on Facebook and placing a phone call to a television station. Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, is currently under investigation to determine whether she had prior knowledge of Mateen's plans.\n\nObama expressed his frustration over the failure of Congress to pass any gun control measures in over two decades. The massacre has put pressure on Congress to act, and after a series of speeches by Democrats, a Democratic senator stated that Republicans had agreed to hold votes on measures to expand background checks and prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns.\n\nThe attack has sparked a new debate over how the United States responds to Islamist militant violence at home and abroad. Republican Senator John McCain stated that Obama is \"directly responsible\" for the Orlando attack due to his failure to prevent the rise of Islamic State. McCain later clarified that he was referring to Obama's national security decisions, not the President himself.\n\nMateen carried out the attack using an assault weapon and handgun that were legally purchased, despite having been investigated by the FBI for possible connections with militant Islamist groups. The attack has reignited the ongoing debate over gun control in the United States.\n\nWakes were held for at least four victims on Thursday, and more somber events are expected to take place over the following two weeks. Over 300 people, including Florida Governor Rick Scott, attended the viewing for Eric Ortiz-Rivera, one of the victims. Ortiz-Rivera was 36 when he was killed during a night of dancing to celebrate a friend's new house.\n\nInformation about Mateen's past, including his school record, is not available in the provided source text. The attack has also led to renewed calls for increased vigilance and security in the United States, particularly in areas with large LGBTQ+ communities.",
    " Title: 113th Congress Shows Signs of Increased Productivity Despite Ongoing Partisan Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 113th Congress, which began following the 2010 Tea Party wave and ended with President Obama's reelection in 2012, was the least productive session in over 60 years. However, the 113th Congress is showing signs of achieving more legislative accomplishments over the next two years, despite the ongoing partisan rancor.\n\nThe year started with a bipartisan group of senior senators preventing a potential \"nuclear\" showdown over the filibuster, a controversial Senate rule. In March, the long-delayed Violence Against Women Act moved from moribund to becoming law. More recently, House and Senate lawmakers have worked diligently to keep the government funded through the end of the fiscal year, without the protests that have characterized such measures in recent years.\n\nOn nearly every major legislative initiative, at least some bipartisan activity is underway, even if it is not yielding everything its sponsors would like. From strengthening firearm controls to immigration reform to renewed discussions of a \"grand bargain\" on taxes and entitlement programs, Congress is currently active with the possibility of compromise. In other words, the dealmakers are resurfacing.\n\nMany of the obstacles to congressional deal-making have been building for years and are not unique to Washington's current dysfunction. The sharp divide among lawmakers reflects the polarization on a wide range of policy and cultural issues that exists among the voters who sent them there.\n\nThe positions are hardened by deep-pocketed advocacy groups with intense ideological focuses and narrow agendas. Such groups make departing from the party line more dangerous than ever. The increasing amount of money needed to run for Congress also means lawmakers spend more time fundraising and less time studying issues or forging relationships with colleagues, the foundation on which deal-making is built.\n\nComplicating the impulse to compromise today is the frequency of \"wave\" elections. Several electoral drubbings \u2013 Democratic triumphs in 2006 and 2008, the Republican resurgence in 2010 \u2013 have created cliques of lawmakers with seemingly narrow mandates to an extent rarely seen in US history.\n\nMembers elected in such waves \"are really not going to make deals that go against what the people who put them there want [ them ] to do,\" says former Rep. Steven LaTourette (R-OH), a centrist. \"On 'Obamacare,' you do not hear a lot of the 2010 class say, 'Well, let's save the good parts and jettison the rest.' It's'repeal, repeal, repeal,' because that was the war drum on the campaign trail.\"\n\nGiven the tough constraints, today's congressional dealmakers are not coming from either party's moderate wing, as many of them have in the past. Those lawmakers have either been defeated or have left office on their own, out of frustration with the toxic atmosphere on the Hill or fear of a primary challenge. Instead, it's up to lawmakers respected on both the left and right, like Republicans Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin or Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), to get things done.\n\n\"If you're waiting for the moderates to compromise,\" you're going to be waiting quite a while,\" says former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT). \"There are not enough left.\"\n\nGetting those on either end of the spectrum to sit down together can be aided by what might be called political entrepreneurs, like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), legislators willing to tackle sensitive issues such as immigration and Social Security before their parties are willing to do the same. However, bringing disparate politicians together on new ideas is another matter. That is now often done through old-fashioned bargaining in the backroom, where lawmakers can make the kind of concessions key to compromise.\n\n\"Part of the value [ of such groups ] is they are working on the outlines of what a bargain on any issue would be before it hits the media,\" says Julian Zelizer, a congressional historian at Princeton University. Bipartisan gangs \"give some kind of signal to other party members that it's OK\" to depart from orthodoxy.\n\nThe public's general disdain for gridlock and voters' outspokenness on individual issues are other factors that may force more compromise. \"Sometimes dealmakers gain strength when there is some kind of social pressure to do something,\" says Mr. Zelizer.",
    " Title: Four Republicans and an Independent Break Away from Party to Condemn President's Language in House Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, four Republicans and one independent broke ranks and voted with the Democrats in a House vote on Tuesday, condemning the president's language. This action serves as a stark reminder of the evolution of the Republican Party, which, in the past, prided itself on being a big tent, welcoming to Latino and African-American voters.\n\nInstead of aligning with the four dissenting members, several party leaders have been advocating messages of patriotism. Some have attempted to sidestep the racial implications, while others seem less concerned about potential backlash.\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, expressed her views in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. She described the four as representing a \"dark underbelly of people in this country,\" adding, \"We are sick and tired of people denigrating that American flag, the American military, veterans, and America.\"\n\nOther party members have been attempting to reframe and soften the message. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, offered a tutorial to Mr. Trump on how to go on the offensive without inviting a backlash. She stated, \"Our opposition to our socialist colleagues has absolutely nothing to do with their gender, with their religion or with their race. It has to do with the content of their policies.\"\n\nThe 2020 election is still over 15 months away, and the Democrats will eventually have a standard-bearer to define the party in opposition to Mr. Trump. However, some Democrats are concerned that criticism of the four congresswomen may resonate with a segment of their voters and independents, who may share similar unease with the policies they support and some of their rhetoric, as they do with Mr. Trump's own bombast.\n\nThe Democrats who performed well in the midterms were those who played down Mr. Trump while highlighting issues like protecting the health insurance of people with pre-existing conditions. Many strategists rallying behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. believe the party cannot count on increasing turnout among young people and minorities and needs to lure back voters it lost to Mr. Trump.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Challenges in Passing American Healthcare Act as Vote Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Healthcare Act (AHCA), the Republican Party's attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), has faced difficulties in garnering enough support for a vote, leading to a planned reattempt on Friday. President Trump, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, has urged House Republicans to pass the bill now, stating that the time for negotiations is over. If the bill fails this time, they will be stuck with the ACA.\n\nThe AHCA has faced opposition from both Democrats and within the GOP, with some moderates and conservatives rejecting the bill due to its deviation from a clean repeal of the ACA. The bill has been criticized as \"Obamacare 2.0\" and \"Obamacare Lite\" by its detractors. Moderates have expressed concerns about the bill's timeline for rolling back the ACA's Medicaid expansion, fearing it would leave too many uninsured. Opponents also criticize the bill for not doing enough to control rising premium costs.\n\nOver the past week, GOP leaders and the president have offered changes to the bill, including a manager's amendment that tinkered with Medicaid and the IRS code. On Thursday, Republicans discussed removing Obamacare \"essential benefits\" such as maternity and prenatal care, preventative care, and other mandatory insurance provisions since the passage of the ACA.\n\nThe stakes are high, with President Trump expressing his \"100 percent\" support for the bill and making a hard sell in recent weeks. He has warned Republican lawmakers that their seats and the Republican majority are in danger in 2018 if they do not pass the bill.\n\nHowever, reluctant House Republicans may also be considering the Senate's stance, as they weigh their votes. At least three senators - Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Tom Cotton - currently oppose the bill, while Ted Cruz has stated he cannot support the bill as it stands. Four other senators have objected to the treatment of the Medicaid expansion in the bill. If three Republican senators vote against the bill, the AHCA will fail in the Senate, which has a slim 52-48 Republican majority.\n\nRepublicans need 215 votes to win passage in the House, due to the absence of Rep. Bobby Rush, a Democrat from Illinois. They can lose no more than 22 votes. The list of House Republicans who have expressed opposition to the bill in its current form is subject to change, with negotiations and potential shifts in support leading up to the vote. Updates on the list will be provided as decisions are made or positions change.",
    " Title: House Republicans Abandon Health Care Replacement Bill, Affordable Care Act Remains in Effect\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have abandoned their health care replacement plan, effectively leaving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as the law of the land. House Speaker Paul Ryan admitted the defeat of the bill shortly after it was pulled from a vote on Friday.\n\n\"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,\" Ryan said. \"I do not know how long it's going to take us to replace this law.\"\n\nPresident Trump, who had previously expressed optimism about the bill's passage, described the setback as a \"learning experience.\" He also suggested the possibility of a future bipartisan bill, stating, \"Both parties can get together...and have a better bill.\"\n\nHowever, Trump and Ryan both indicated that health care would be put on hold for the time being, with the focus shifting to tax reform. The failure of the health care bill is a significant setback for Trump's leadership and Ryan's ability to control his conference, as it was a key campaign promise for the Republican Party.\n\nThe inability of Republicans to reach consensus on a bill, given their control of the House, Senate, and White House, has been met with criticism and raises questions about the party's ability to govern. The risks were high for Trump on the bill, as he has been portrayed as a deal-maker, and the failure to pass the bill raises questions about his legislative and policy experience.\n\nThe way forward for Republicans on exactly how to replace Obamacare remains unclear, and it is not certain whether they will try again. The GOP has vowed repeatedly over the past eight years to repeal and replace Obamacare, but the legislative stalemate casts a cloud over the legislative path forward after an election waged largely as the antithesis to a progressive agenda enacted by former President Barack Obama.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have taken a victory lap in the GOP's defeat. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, whose caucus was decimated in 2010 after the health care bill was passed, appeared flanked by Democratic leadership to gloat just a day after the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.",
    " Title: President Trump Embraces \"Border Warrior\" Role Amid Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is now the \"proud\" owner of a government shutdown \u2014 his third \u2014 and he does not seem to mind. The threat of an extended shutdown is less of a concern to the president than not fulfilling his central campaign pledge to build a border wall and appearing as a fraud, according to White House aides and Trump allies.\n\nTrump spent the weekend digging in on his position, meeting with hard-line conservatives and signaling through his top aides that he could stomach a shutdown that could drag on well into the new year. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, set the bar on Sunday, stating, \"I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next couple of days.\"\n\nThe holiday shutdown comes amid a series of turbulent events, including a stock market rout, Cabinet shakeups, and turbulence from the Republican congressional ranks over the president's decision to pull troops from Syria and scale back the U.S. presence in Afghanistan.\n\nAmid the disarray, Trump is resuming a partisan mantle he views as a unifier for the right: border warrior. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) argued that Democrats and their leaders were the reason the country was in for a protracted confrontation. \"We're not going to abandon the wall,\" Graham said. \"We're going to build a wall, and to all those Americans who want us to abandon the wall and open up the border, that's what this fight's about.\"\n\nTrump's aides have half-heartedly tried to pin the blame on Democrats, despite the president's earlier statements suggesting that the American people were with him on the issue. Trump, who casts the southern border wall in political terms as a \"total winner,\" even as polls show that majorities of Americans don't support the structure, is marching out senior administration officials to assert that he's been \"very clear\" about his expectations for funding various \"physical barriers.\"\n\nRepublicans are not uniformly falling in line. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee blasted Trump for failing to avoid the partial shutdown, dismissing his hardening negotiating posture on immigration as \"a made-up fight so that the president could look like he's fighting.\"\n\nTrump's reelection campaign has leapt quickly at the chance to capitalize on the stalemate and paint him as an authentic promise-keeper. One Trump campaign appeal to supporters tarred Democrats as insensitive to the safety of Americans. \"FIGHT BACK,\" it implored. \"Donate to become an Official Build the Wall Member.\" And other Trump-backed groups are running ads and circulating petitions to Republicans.\n\nFor the president, the border wall is about far more than a structure, allies concede. The White House has long seen his \"Build the wall\" promise as an indicator for how far his early pledges alone could take him with voters he'll need to secure reelection. \"The wall is important, but it's more the underlying anti-immigrant message that's the key,\" a former White House official said.\n\nIn addition to saying Mexico would pay for the wall \u2014 a goal the administration maintains is still viable, albeit most likely retroactively \u2014 other of Trump's big early claims remain unfulfilled and look increasingly doubtful. During his 2016 campaign, Trump estimated he would complete the entire border wall within two years from the time he started. \"We'll start quickly,\" he added. \"And it'll be a real wall.\"\n\nWhile the wall has yet to come to fruition, the president has been filling the void with more words. Trump repeatedly boasts about how much of the wall has already been built, even though little if any building has happened, let alone during his presidency. To keep up appearances during the midterm elections, aides handed out signs that read \"Finish the Wall.\"\n\nWell before the recent conservative backlash reared, one threat the president's team identified on the subject was supporters beginning to doubt his ability to deliver. Though Trump could continue to point a finger at Congress, which has given him only a fraction of what he wants for border security, another person close to the president noted that the government-funding exercise was one area where he had the ultimate say.\n\nFor now, it's a function of leverage, which the ally acknowledged Democrats have.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Gains Momentum for DACA, Net Neutrality, and Sexual Harassment Bills Despite Leadership Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events this week, the House of Representatives has shown signs of increasing independence from leadership, with members pushing for votes on several legislative fixes for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, net neutrality, and sexual harassment.\n\nRep. Jeff Denham (R-CA) is leading a move to gather a majority of House members to sign a discharge petition that would force floor votes on immigration, despite Speaker Paul Ryan's opposition. As of Thursday, Denham reportedly has enough support for the discharge petition to force a vote, but he continues to negotiate behind closed doors to find a compromise immigration bill that leadership can bring up.\n\nThe Republican leadership is not pleased with this development. Speaker Ryan stated on Thursday that discharge petitions \"lose control\" on the House floor, meaning he loses control over when and how to vote on immigration\u2014if at all. Politico reported that Ryan and his team are \"quietly promising the figures behind the discharge petition and those who might sign that they will put a bunch of immigration bills on the floor\" in June, a clear effort to regain power over the situation.\n\nIn a separate development, a bipartisan group of senators defied Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and voted to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) controversial ruling to dismantle net neutrality. The vote to reinstate the Obama-era net neutrality rules won the support of 49 Democrats as well as three Republican senators: Susan Collins of Maine, John Kennedy of Louisiana, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. This group was enough to pass the 51-vote benchmark needed to repeal recently introduced federal rules, such as the FCC's internet guidance.\n\nIn another sign of frustration, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand invoked an obscure Senate rule to try to put a House-passed sexual harassment and discrimination bill on the Senate calendar without McConnell's support, in another sign of frustration. The bill would overhaul how harassment complaints are made in Congress and make lawmakers personally accountable for paying settlements. The legislation, a version of which the House has passed 100 days ago, has been stalled in the Senate while negotiators iron out some details in the language.\n\nThese developments highlight the growing frustration among rank-and-file lawmakers with deferring to leadership. James Wallner, a political scientist and former executive director of the Senate Steering Committee, stated, \"When [members] look behind the curtain and the emperor has no clothes, then it becomes contagious. And that's what leaders don't like. So far they have been successful in convincing members that it's not good for the majority.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen where these efforts will go, but it is clear that rank-and-file members are increasingly taking matters into their own hands, despite leadership's opposition.",
    " Title: Lori Lightfoot Wins Chicago Mayoral Race, Becoming First Black Woman and Openly Gay Person to Lead Third-Largest U.S. City\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot has been declared the winner of the Chicago mayoral race, making history as the first black woman and openly gay individual to lead the third-largest city in the United States. Lightfoot defeated Toni Preckwinkle, a longtime political insider and Cook County Board president, in Tuesday's election.\n\nLightfoot, who has never been elected to public office, delivered a commanding victory over Preckwinkle, who served in the City Council for 19 years. Lightfoot's campaign focused on ridding City Hall of corruption and addressing the needs of low-income and working-class residents, a message that resonated with voters weary of political scandal and insider deals.\n\nIn her victory speech, Lightfoot pledged to break the city's cycle of corruption and ensure that a resident's zip code does not determine their destiny. She also emphasized her commitment to making Chicago a place where race and sexual orientation do not matter.\n\nChicago will become the largest U.S. city to elect a black woman as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20. She will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U.S. cities, including Atlanta and New Orleans.\n\nThe vote to succeed outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel came just days after Chicago state prosecutors dropped charges against actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused of faking a hate-crime attack that implicated supporters of President Trump. The decision to drop charges has sparked controversy and criticism.\n\nLightfoot seized on outrage over the deadly shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald to launch her campaign. The shooting, at the hands of white officer Jason Van Dyke, became a major issue in the election.\n\nThroughout the campaign, the two candidates exchanged barbs, with Preckwinkle focusing on Lightfoot's work as a partner at Mayer Brown, a large law firm, and labeling her a \"wealthy corporate lawyer.\" Preckwinkle also tried to cast Lightfoot as an insider for working in police oversight posts under Emanuel and former Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nIn one ad, Preckwinkle criticized Lightfoot's oversight of emergency communications in 2004 when a fire killed four children. A judge ordered Lightfoot to preserve 911 tapes after questions were raised about how the emergency call was handled. The ad noted some of the tapes were destroyed, prompting the judge to rebuke Lightfoot.\n\nDespite the contentious campaign, both candidates expressed similar ideas to boost the city's finances, including support for a casino in Chicago and a graduated income tax system. Preckwinkle also promoted additional investments in neighborhood schools, affordable housing, and criminal justice reform.\n\nLightfoot said that as mayor, she would focus on investing in neighborhoods on the West and South Sides and bringing transparency and accountability to City Hall. She added she also wanted to end City Hall corruption and restore people's faith in government.\n\n\"The machine's been in decline for a while, but it still has a grip on certain things,\" Lightfoot said. \"This is our opportunity to send it to its grave, once and for all.\"",
    " Title: Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Stages 12-Hour Filibuster on Drone Strikes\n\nArticle:\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul staged a 12-hour filibuster in the Senate on Wednesday, expressing concerns over the potential danger of drone strikes to U.S. citizens on American soil. The filibuster, which was the longest in recent Senate memory, successfully delayed a potential vote to confirm President Barack Obama's nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nSenator Paul began speaking at 11:47 a.m. on Wednesday and continued until about 12:39 a.m. on Thursday. He yielded the floor after more than 12 hours of continuous speaking, having remained inside the Senate chamber during this time.\n\n\"I would try to go another 12 hours and try to break Strom Thurmond's record, but there are some limits to filibustering and I am going to have to go take care of one of those here,\" Paul said.\n\nImmediately after Paul finished, Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois introduced a motion to end debate on the nomination of John Brennan to run the CIA.\n\nIn an interview with reporters after the filibuster, Paul stated that his team had not planned for the extended debate, which turned into a rare marathon talkfest. However, he did employ some strategy, such as frequent visits to the candy drawer and minimizing water consumption to manage his energy levels.\n\nSenator Paul's filibuster initially surprised many members of the Senate, who had been prepared to vote to confirm Brennan to lead the spy agency earlier on Wednesday. As the day progressed, several of Paul's colleagues, as well as one Democrat, joined him to criticize the Obama administration for its refusal to rule out the use of drones against Americans on U.S. soil or to disclose more information about drone policy.\n\nBy nightfall, Paul's effort had gained the support of more of his colleagues, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined him on the floor. They used their time to quote figures such as Ronald Reagan, Shakespeare, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio referenced \"The Godfather\" and rapper Jay-Z.\n\nShortly before the 12-hour mark, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called via Twitter for \"all Republican US senators\" to join the filibuster. Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Tim Scott of South Carolina spoke about the Senate's dysfunction and the dangers of the national debt, while Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona expressed support for Paul's questions about drone policy.",
    " Title: Trump Requests $8.6 Billion for Border Wall in 2020 Budget Proposal\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced his intention to request $8.6 billion for the construction of a border wall with Mexico in his 2020 congressional budget proposal, set to be submitted on Monday. This move is expected to reignite a funding standoff with Congress, as the proposed funding amount is likely to face stiff opposition from the Democrat-held House.\n\nAccording to a senior administration official, the $8.6 billion would be used to build or replace approximately 700 miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. Reuters reported that the funding for the wall would be drawn from the Department of Homeland Security budget ($5 billion) and the military construction budget at the Pentagon ($3.6 billion).\n\nThe budget proposal also includes $3.6 million in military construction funding to help fund projects affected by the wall. In addition to wall funding, Trump's proposal calls for the hiring of an additional 2,800 law enforcement and other personnel to reinforce the border and 100 immigration judge teams.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) have indicated that the president's $8.6 billion ask is a non-starter. In a statement, they criticized Trump for causing widespread chaos by shutting down the government to secure wall funding in the past.\n\nCongress must approve funding for fiscal 2020 by Oct. 1, or funding could lapse, and the government could shut down. Trump's requests for border funding have shifted during his time in office as he seeks to fulfill a signature campaign promise.\n\nIn the past, the administration's proposal for fiscal year 2019 sought $18 billion for the wall, including $1.6 billion to construct 65 miles in south Texas. The president triggered a partial government shutdown in December when he demanded $5.7 billion in wall funding. Trump agreed to reopen the government without wall funding but continued to press lawmakers for $5.7 billion for the structure. Congress ultimately approved $1.375 billion for border barriers, and the president issued a national emergency to bypass Congress and spend roughly $8 billion to construct his long-desired border wall.\n\nIn making the emergency declaration, the president said he planned to redirect $3.6 billion in military construction funding toward the border project. He also said he would take separate executive action to repurpose about $2.5 billion from the Defense Department's drug-interdiction program and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset-forfeiture fund.\n\nThe national emergency has drawn pushback from Congress, with the House voting to approve a resolution that would terminate the emergency. The Senate is expected to do the same this week. The Senate vote would set Trump up for the first veto of his presidency, with neither chamber likely to override it.\n\nTrump has made the construction of a wall along the southern border a key agenda item since he launched his campaign in 2015. His inability to complete the task has prompted criticism from immigration hard-liners, though Trump has insisted the wall is being built, and he has transitioned his mantra from \"Build the wall\" to \"Finish the wall.\"\n\nLarry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, acknowledged on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the request for wall funding is likely to spur yet another fight with Congress, but he depicted it as a necessary one. \"We have to be much tougher and have more constructive immigration policy,\" Kudlow said. \"We have to be much together and have more constructive immigration policy, which we will be developing.\" Kudlow added, \"The whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance.\"",
    " Title: Democratic National Convention Kicks Off in Charlotte: A Clear Plan for a Stronger America\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic National Convention commenced in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday, with Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the convention's chair, outlining the party's aim to present a clear plan for the nation's economic recovery. Villaraigosa stated that by the convention's conclusion on Thursday, the Democratic platform would be defined, and the election would be about a significant choice.\n\nVillaraigosa compared the Democratic candidate's economic approach to that of the Republican nominee, stating, \"We are talking about a candidate who wants to build an economy from the middle out and a candidate who wants to build an economy from the top down.\"\n\nThe opening press conference mirrored themes expressed by President Obama in recent interviews, such as his assertion to Time magazine that a clear explanation of his policies and the contrasting approach of the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, would sway American voters in his favor.\n\nAlice Germond, the National Committee Secretary, reiterated the Democrats' pride in President Obama and his accomplishments during the media briefing. In response to perceived GOP secrecy regarding their platform, Germond stated that by the time President Obama delivers his acceptance speech on Thursday evening, everyone will have a copy of the platform.\n\nVillaraigosa indicated that the following days would serve to remind the country of Obama's first term in office, highlighting his role in \"stopping an economic catastrophe,\" \"saving the auto industry,\" and passing the landmark healthcare law.\n\nIn response to a recently released Gallup poll indicating tepid reception to Romney's acceptance speech, Obama campaign National Press Secretary Ben LaBolt stated, \"Most Americans are looking for an answer on how we're going to secure the middle class.\" He added that the convention would be used to address these concerns and engage in an honest conversation about the country's state in 2008.\n\nLaBolt emphasized that the Democrats had made progress and that the president would use his Thursday speech to outline his plans to continue on this path.",
    " Title: Obama's Last-Minute Actions: Commutation of Chelsea Manning's Sentence and UN Resolution on Israel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of his presidency, Barack Obama took two controversial actions that were met with criticism and surprise. The commutation of Chelsea Manning's sentence and the passing of a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israel were the president's last acts before leaving office.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst who was convicted of espionage and theft of government documents. Manning had been sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking nearly half a million military reports and another quarter-million State Department documents to WikiLeaks. The documents, according to intelligence sources, jeopardized the lives of American soldiers and local allies in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe commutation of Manning's sentence was criticized as a \"finger-in-the-eye willfulness\" by some, as the documents released by Manning were considered a threat to national security. The documents exposed military secrets that could have caused harm to American troops, allies, and interests.\n\nThe other last-minute Obama bombshell occurred four weeks earlier when, for the first time in nearly a half-century, the United States abandoned Israel on a crucial Security Council resolution, allowing the passage of a condemnation that will plague both Israel and its citizens for years to come. The U.S. has no power to reverse the Security Council resolution.\n\nThe actions were seen as a departure from Obama's previous stance on WikiLeaks and Israel. During the 2016 election campaign, Obama had demanded a report on the release of stolen materials and e-mails by WikiLeaks and had imposed sanctions on Russia. He had also been vocal about the sanctity of the American political process.\n\nThe actions were met with criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with some arguing that the actions were a calculated move to curry favor with the international left or to establish bona fides for a potential future role on the international stage. However, others suggest that the actions were authentic, reflecting Obama's true beliefs and values.\n\nThe article does not provide a clear explanation for Obama's actions, and it is unavailable whether the president had any specific motives for his last-minute actions. The article also does not provide any further details about the commutation of Oscar Lopez Rivera's sentence, a Puerto Rican terrorist who was also released by Obama in the final days of his presidency.",
    " Title: US Secretary of State Kerry Seeks Coalition Partners to Combat Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is currently in Saudi Arabia, aiming to assemble a \"broad coalition of partners\" to join the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State. This initiative is a key component of a strategy unveiled by President Obama in his national address the previous day.\n\nDuring the talks, which involve a diverse group of Middle Eastern nations, a senior U.S. State Department official stated that the U.S. requires regional support for establishing military bases and overflight for airstrikes, as well as improved coordination to prevent individuals from funding extremist groups.\n\nThe U.S. seeks to halt Islamic State oil smuggling through the Jordanian and Turkish borders, with authorities pledging to take action, but the U.S. will work more closely with them over the next few weeks on intelligence sharing and border control, according to the official.\n\nThe talks today include leaders from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. President Obama stated last night that the U.S. \"will be joined by a broad coalition of partners,\" and Secretary Kerry will travel across the Middle East and Europe in the coming days to enlist more partners in this fight, particularly Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive the terrorists from their lands.\n\nSaudi Arabia's agreement to host training camps for \"moderate Syrian rebels\" is seen as a sign of support, according to U.S. officials. Saudi Arabia is considered crucial to a successful coalition due to its religious significance with Sunnis, as Islamic State fighters are Sunni.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. Many countries essential to the coalition are skeptical of the U.S. commitment to follow through on its promises to eliminate the Islamic State, after it refrained from airstrikes last year against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe Monitor reports that these countries have favored, in various ways, the same anti-Assad rebels that the U.S. would like to see prevail, but they also support Islamist groups that spawned the Islamic State and other jihadi groups that are now beyond their control. This complicates any U.S.-led coalition against radicalism.\n\nDan Murphy, writing for the Monitor's Backchannels column, cautions that arming \"Syrian moderates\" is fraught with uncertainty. The Obama administration's previous attempts to arm \"moderate\" Syrian rebels were unsuccessful, with a U.S. weapons depot being quickly overrun and seized by IS militants, effectively ending that effort.\n\nAfter his Middle East tour, Secretary of State Kerry will travel to Europe, where he should receive a warmer response from governments concerned about the fact that hundreds of Europeans have left to fight in Syria. At the NATO Summit last week in Wales, the U.S. had support from Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Italy, Poland, and Denmark.\n\nFrance has played the most public supporting role so far, pledging to act in an international coalition if international law is followed. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius will travel to Baghdad tomorrow, before France hosts a conference in Paris on Monday to coordinate efforts to tackle the Islamic State.\n\n\"An international mobilization is necessary to respond to this trans-national danger that can reach our territory,\" Mr. Fabius said, according to Reuters. \"In Iraq, the government and minorities have called for help (and) we answered with deliveries of military equipment and humanitarian aid.\"\n\nThis week, the UK said it would send a limited amount of arms to Kurds in Iraq to fight the Islamic State. Germany also agreed to do the same. In a Guardian opinion piece, Hayder al-Khoei, an associate fellow on the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, said that \"the UK should be an important player in the international coalition that Obama is trying to set up to confront the most dangerous terrorist organization of the 21st century.\"",
    " Title: George Papadopoulos Labeled as \"Proactive Cooperator\" in Mueller Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe former Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, has been identified as a \"proactive cooperator\" in court documents unveiled on Monday. This term, referring to Papadopoulos, has sparked speculation that the 30-year-old energy consultant may have worn a wire to aid investigators in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to a court filing submitted by prosecutors, the reference to Papadopoulos' status is aimed at sealing court filings in the case, stating that \"premature disclosure\" of his arrest would significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperator.\n\nThe term \"proactive cooperation\" is generally understood to mean that the defendant will engage in some type of undercover work on behalf of the Government, such as wearing a wire and/or meeting face to face with persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity, as explained in a 2001 federal court case.\n\nAt a plea hearing held on Oct. 5, Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor in the Office of the Special Counsel, shed light on Papadopoulos' cooperation. Zelinsky stated that at Papadopoulos' sentencing, prosecutors would make note of his \"efforts to cooperate with the Government\" as long as he continued \"to meet with and provide information to the Government on request.\"\n\nPapadopoulos was arrested on July 27 on charges that he lied to FBI agents during a Jan. 27 interview. Agents met with Papadopoulos as part of the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he lied to agents during that meeting about his interactions with three Russian nationals. Papadopoulos initially claimed that he knew the Russians prior to joining the Trump campaign on March 6, 2016. However, investigators obtained Papadopoulos' emails and social media exchanges, which showed that he was lying.\n\nPapadopoulos discussed arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. One of Papadopoulos' contacts, a London-based professor, also told him in April that the Russian government had obtained \"thousands\" of Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nThe White House on Monday downplayed the revelations, stating that Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government.\n\nPapadopoulos' Oct. 5 plea deal and his earlier arrest remained a closely held secret until Monday, just hours after Mueller's office unsealed an indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates.\n\nManafort and Gates are charged with money laundering and conspiracy. The indictment provides no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.\n\nThe revelation that Papadopoulos was serving as a \"proactive cooperator\" has sparked widespread speculation about the extent of his cooperation with the Mueller team.\n\nRon Hosko, a former assistant director of the FBI's criminal division, suggests that it is possible that Papadopoulos wore a wire as part of his cooperation agreement. \"I think it's a fair assessment that it means Mueller and Co. might have been working with [Papadopoulos] to engage other subjects in conversation along the lines suggested in the article,\" said Hosko, referring to the possibility of Papadopoulos wearing a wire.\n\nRecordings of Papadopoulos' conversations could have then been used to approach additional subjects. On CNN, legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin stated that the government's disclosure strongly suggests that Papadopoulos was wearing a wire or recording conversations with Trump associates.\n\n\"What this says to me is that Papadopoulos between July and October was wearing a wire. He was recording conversations secretly with people who are subjects and targets of this investigation,\" he said, adding that \"that's the only reasonable explanation of what's in those court papers.\"\n\n\"If he was wearing a wire, this summer and fall, think about that, just weeks ago, that is a whole new chapter of possibilities in this investigation and potentially a very, very big deal,\" Toobin concluded.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats to Grill William Barr on Mueller's Russia Investigation at Attorney General Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares for hearings on William Barr's nomination for attorney general, special counsel Robert Mueller will be a significant presence in the room. Several Senate Democrats on the committee plan to question Barr at his confirmation hearing next week about his views on Mueller's Russia investigation, focusing on a controversial memo Barr wrote last year to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nIn the memo, Barr criticized Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice as \"fatally misconceived.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday stated that Barr should be disqualified from leading the DOJ in part because of the memo.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he will ask Barr if he will stop political interference in the special counsel's probe and whether he will recuse himself from overseeing the investigation if he cannot provide an \"ironclad\" commitment to protecting Mueller and disavowing statements made in the memo.\n\nBarr's nomination battle comes at a critical moment in Donald Trump's presidency, with the Justice Department in transition and Mueller's probe entering its 20th month. The investigation has resulted in seven guilty pleas and a conviction of the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denounced the Mueller investigation, labeling it a \"witch hunt,\" and has taken to Twitter dozens of times to criticize the investigation and the investigators involved. A bipartisan group of senators is also reintroducing a bill to protect Mueller, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said such a bill isn't needed and has refused to bring it up for a floor vote.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), another Judiciary committee member, also agreed that the Mueller investigation will be a central issue and called it \"troublesome\" that Barr volunteered his opinion on Mueller's authority. \"I'm sure he'll deny any culpability and assure me that he's going to be a straight arrow, but I come to it with a degree of skepticism,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats say that the departure of Rosenstein, who is reportedly leaving the Justice Department after a new attorney general is confirmed, also raises the stakes for choosing the next attorney general. While Democrats can't block Barr's nomination by themselves, they may succeed in getting him to commit to protecting the Mueller investigation under oath.\n\n\"I would have liked [Rosenstein]... to be the attorney general,\" said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) adding that she wants to hear from Barr \"that the Attorney General's office is an independent entity.\"\n\nTrump nominated Barr for attorney general in December. If confirmed, he would replace former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who Trump resented after he recused himself from the Russia investigation. Barr also served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nDespite the focus on the Mueller investigation, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee don't appear to have a completely uniform strategy for how to approach the nomination hearing. When asked about the Democratic strategy, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said he had \"no idea\" and would focus his attention on meeting with Barr and asking his own questions. Blumenthal seemed to agree.\n\n\"I have my questions and my strategy for asking those questions. I don't think there's a Democratic strategy,\" he said.\n\nSenate Republicans are bracing for Barr's hearing to become confrontational, particularly given the contentious nature of the committee's high-profile hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has no doubt that Democrats will try to block Barr's confirmation in no small part because Democratic senators with 2020 aspirations may use the hearing to stand out.\n\n\"Senate Democrats especially on the Judiciary Committee have demonstrated that they will treat almost anything like a political circus, and you've got right now it seems like half of the Judiciary Committee on the Democratic side running for president so I fully expect more 'Spartacus' moments in the next two years,\" said Cruz, referencing Sen. Cory Booker's performance during the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\nDespite potential Democratic attacks, Senate Republicans don't appear concerned about Barr's memo to Rosenstein and remain confident that he will be confirmed, particularly given that they expanded their majority during the midterm election. Only 50 votes are needed to confirm a nominee, and so Republicans don't need any Democratic votes.\n\nBarr met Wednesday with Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and former Committee Chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Graham said that during their meeting, Barr reassured him of his respect for Mueller.\n\n\"He said 'I've known Bob Mueller for decades,' their wives are like best friends,\" Graham said, adding that Barr believes Mueller is \"professional, will be fair to the president, fair to the country and... is going to make sure that Bob Mueller can finish his job.\"\n\nGraham also expressed support for bringing up the Mueller protection bill in his committee if the probe is still going on next month.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is also on the Judiciary Committee, doesn't see Barr's memo to Rosenstein on the Mueller investigation as disqualifying and noted in an interview that Barr wrote the memo as a private citizen.\n\nNot all Republicans are on board yet with Barr's nomination. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) reiterated his concern Wednesday with Barr's view of civil liberties. \"I believe there are some statements of his saying the Patriot Act didn't go far enough and should have gone farther,\" Paul said.",

The renewal period begins on November 15, with a deadline of December 15 for those renewing to secure a new plan by the start of the year.\n\nThe specifics of the renewal process have yet to be determined, as stated by Paula Steiner, chief strategy officer for Health Care Service Corporation, which offers Blue Cross plans in five states. \"We're still waiting on the details of the process,\" she said, adding, \"We haven't gone through any testing yet of any changes to the system for 2015.\"\n\nAndrew Slavitt, principal deputy administrator for Medicare, which oversees the insurance marketplaces, expressed optimism about the renewal process, stating, \"We're putting in place the simplest path for consumers this year to renew their coverage.\" Those who prefer to maintain their current plan can do so automatically, as is common with employer coverage, with the option to renew by taking no action.\n\nThe federal online marketplace is being continuously improved, according to Mr. Slavitt, who noted that the government was updating the website to allow renewals. \"We're in a very different position than we were last year,\" he said.\n\nCompared to the 2014 marketplaces, 30 carriers have requested entrance into the marketplaces for 2015, and 1.6 times more plans are being offered, according to McKinsey & Company's Center for US Health System Reform. Prices for 2015 are expected to remain varied, with some plans experiencing a 30% increase while others see a similar decrease, depending on the market and policy. \"We are definitely seeing a lot of volatility in pricing,\" said Erica Hutchins Coe, a McKinsey expert.",
    " Title: Ferguson October: A Wake-Up Call for America\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the weekend, protestors and activists, including students, clergy, and concerned citizens, descended on Ferguson, Missouri, for a series of marches, protests, sit-ins, and civil disobedience, collectively known as Ferguson October. Among the activists arrested was Patrisse Cullors-Brignac, an organizer with Black Lives Matter, who tweeted from a St. Louis County jail cell about taking over a Wal-Mart.\n\nThe arrests have sparked debate on social media, with some questioning the appropriateness of disturbing the peace in a private business. However, the activists argue that the time for business as usual has passed. The shooting of John Crawford in a Beaver Creek, Ohio Wal-Mart, who could not reasonably expect to come out alive, is seen as a sign that the status quo is no longer acceptable.\n\nThe activists draw parallels to the racial segregation of the past, which occurred in \"private\" businesses like Woolworth's and Hecht's. They argue that Black people are the hands on the nation's social progress clock, and the current state of racial inequality is a reflection of that.\n\nThe activists are also drawing inspiration from young people, who are creative, political, and joyful in their struggle for justice. They are registering new voters, disrupting public events, and taking over public spaces with impromptu games and performances. The movement has collected over 3000 new voter registrations (Update: This number has since been revised downward to 128), but the activists remain skeptical of the voting system.\n\nThe movement is also a symbolic rejection of the current political leadership, with activists criticizing President Barack Obama for his silence on the issue and his inability to effect change. Some have compared the movement to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, with activists arguing that they are fighting for a new future and a new version of themselves.\n\nThe movement is a call to action, with activists urging people to \"stay woke\" and to put their bodies on the line for justice. The movement is undignified, improper, unabashed, and unapologetic, but the activists argue that this is necessary to effect change. The movement is a call for a new America, one that is willing to fight for justice and to reject the status quo of racial inequality.",
    " Title: Mayorkas Denies Allegations of Improper Visa Aid at Homeland Security Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's nominee for the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, unequivocally denied allegations that he improperly helped a company run by Hillary Clinton's brother obtain a visa during his confirmation hearing on Thursday. The hearing proceeded despite calls by Republicans for a postponement due to an ongoing investigation by the department's inspector general.\n\nMayorkas, the current director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He stated that he \"made no orders\" in these cases and only offers guidance based on the \"facts\" and \"the law.\"\n\n\"I have never, ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case,\" he said. Mayorkas also stated that he had \"no idea\" he was under investigation and \"quite frankly, I still don't understand it.\"\n\nRepublicans boycotted the hearing, after having tried unsuccessfully to get it postponed. In a statement, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said, \"I cannot participate in a hearing I believe to be unfair and improper to all parties involved.\"\n\nIn a letter to committee Chairman Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., on Wednesday, four Republican senators claimed the news of the investigation took them by surprise. They said neither the White House nor Mayorkas had disclosed the existence of the probe to them before. The investigation was first reported on Tuesday.\n\n\"We believe it is neither appropriate nor fair to consider the nomination of an individual under investigation,\" the lawmakers wrote. The letter was signed by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; and Coburn.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, also wrote committee leaders asking for a postponement \"until the facts are more fully developed.\"\n\nThe White House is supporting Mayorkas' nomination, stating that he underwent a \"thorough\" FBI background check before the nomination, and they have no concerns about his suitability for the position. However, the inspector general's office has not closed the book on the case.\n\nThe office has confirmed that it is investigating Mayorkas' role in helping secure a foreign investor visa for Tony Rodham's Gulf Coast Funds Management even after the application was denied and an appeal rejected. The international investor visa program run by USCIS, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to get visas if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens.\n\nIn an email to lawmakers on Monday, the IG's office said \"at this point in our investigation, we do not have any findings of criminal misconduct.\" Congressional officials briefed on the investigation said the visa was for a Chinese executive. Homeland Security and Citizenship and Immigration Services have not commented on the investigation.\n\nRodham's company said Tuesday it was not aware of the investigation or of any investor visa application being denied. In a prepared opening statement, Sen. Tom Carper acknowledged questions surrounding \"Director Mayorkas' qualifications.\"\n\n\"At this point in time, we do not have all the facts,\" Carper said. He also stated that it's \"my understanding\" that Mayorkas has not yet been interviewed by the IG's office. He added that despite objections from Republicans, \"This hearing will allow us to continue the process of vetting this nominee.\"\n\nAside from the controversy surrounding Mayorkas, Carper expressed confidence in his nomination. \"I have also taken the opportunity to review Mr. Mayorkas' FBI file, not once, but twice,\" Carper said. He added, \"Nothing in my conversations with Mr. Mayorkas or in my review of his FBI file has convinced me that we should not be holding this hearing today.\"\n\nAccording to the IG's office email to lawmakers, the FBI's Washington Field Office was told about the Mayorkas investigation in June after it inquired about Mayorkas as part of the White House background investigation for his nomination. The investigation does not appear to have any direct ties to Clinton's tenure as secretary of state.",
    " Title: Congressional Research Service Suggests Congressional Power to Halt Presidential Executive Action on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter to Senator Jeff Sessions, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has concluded that Congress has the power to halt President Obama's executive action on immigration, despite the president's use of a fee-based agency to carry out the key work. As Congress prepares to conclude its session, the annual spending bills, the response to Mr. Obama's immigration moves, and the annual defense policy bill are among the chief issues lawmakers must address.\n\nRepresentative Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, stated that Congress needs to protect its prerogatives. In a recent appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Cotton argued that the employment situation alone should motivate Congress to block the president's executive action. He suggested that the president's first post-election action, easing the employment of illegal immigrants, was not beneficial for working families, while jobs for American workers were still scarce.\n\nCongress is scheduled to conclude its session by December 11, leaving less than two weeks for lawmakers to finish their business. Republican leaders are grappling with decisions on which issues to address now, while Democrats control the Senate, and which issues to defer until the next Congress, when Republicans will have at least 53 seats and control of the Senate and a larger House majority.\n\nThe CRS, in its letter to Mr. Sessions, stated that Congress has power over fee-based agencies, even though such agencies have independent sources of funding. The Supreme Court has established that Congress can dictate how an agency spends because all government revenue, even when collected by a fee-based agency, technically goes to the overall fund and is reappropriated to the agency. The CRS noted that the funds available to the agency through fee collections would be subject to the same potential restrictions imposed by Congress on the use of its appropriations as any other type of appropriated fund.\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee, which controls the spending process, had previously stated that the annual spending process would not be able to curb the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the federal agency that will handle most of the president's amnesty. USCIS is almost entirely fee-based, which means it has sources of funding independent of taxpayers. The House Appropriations Committee stated that this meant it had less leverage. However, the CRS analysts argued that Congress does have power, even over fee-based agencies.\n\nOther issues Congress may confront in the coming weeks include December tax and spending deadlines, the expansion of the war in Iraq to combat Islamic State terrorists, and the thorny issue of detainees at Guantanamo Bay when Congress tackles the annual defense policy bill. Additionally, the House and Senate may face the contentious issue of detainees at Guantanamo Bay when Congress addresses the annual defense policy bill. The House and Senate may also confront the thorny issue of detainees at Guantanamo Bay when Congress tackles the annual defense policy bill, which is considered must-pass legislation.",
    " Title: Analysis of the 2012 Presidential Race: Economic Narratives and Upcoming Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2012 Presidential race, the Democratic narrative, as outlined by former President Bill Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden, suggests that President Barack Obama has been burdened with impossibly high expectations regarding jobs and economic growth. The argument is that Obama inherited a dire economic situation, prevented it from worsening, and is now overseeing an improvement, a situation that no one else could have navigated as effectively.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, is perceived as not doing an adequate job of countering this narrative. Romney's strategy, according to some, is to focus on the economy, as the incumbent president traditionally bears the responsibility for the state of the economy.\n\nOne interpretation of the ongoing discourse is that the public is becoming increasingly aware that President Obama inherited an eight-year catastrophic economic situation. Critics argue that, a year ago, the public was beginning to accept the idea that Obama had worsened the situation, not improved it, through his actions.\n\nAnother point of contention is the unemployment rate. Critics argue that the high unemployment numbers should be adjusted to account for those who have given up looking for work. They also suggest that the Obama administration has lost sight of the message of economic resurgence, focusing instead on the negative aspects of the economy.\n\nThe upcoming presidential debates, scheduled for three times between now and Election Day, are seen as Romney's best opportunity to change the narrative and close the gap in the race. The debates are expected to be closely watched by undecided voters, who are still making up their minds, and by those who enjoy the competitive nature of the debates.\n\nThe debates are also seen as an opportunity for Romney to present a more likable and relatable image, in contrast to the president, who has been on stage with a rival for three and a half years. The debates are expected to be a significant factor in the final weeks of the campaign.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans and Democrats Negotiate Stimulus Package Details\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans unveiled a $1-trillion economic stimulus plan last Thursday, proposing direct payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for joint returns. However, Senate Democrats blocked the bill on Sunday, expressing concerns over its support for big corporations and insufficient aid for working families.\n\nAs negotiations continue, Senate Democrats have outlined several requirements to pass the bill, including:\n\n1. President Donald Trump invoking the Defense Production Act to compel private companies to manufacture necessary medical equipment such as respirators and masks.\n2. Allocating nearly $40 billion to help states maintain school funding and support colleges during the crisis.\n3. Providing states with billions in grant funding to facilitate elections, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated on Monday, \"We're very close to reaching a deal. Very close. Our goal is to reach a deal today. And we\u2019re hopeful, even confident, that we will meet that goal.\" However, Schumer added, \"We have the obligation to get the details right.\"\n\nThe current proposal includes one-time lump-sum payments of up to $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for joint returns, and an additional $500 for each qualifying child. The income limit starts at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint returns. The amount individuals receive would be reduced by 5% for each dollar of income exceeding these thresholds.\n\nThe federal government is expected to use tax filings to determine eligibility for stimulus checks. Individuals who have set up direct deposit with the IRS can expect the payment quicker than those who receive checks by mail.\n\nThe last time the federal government sent checks to Americans was in 2008, under President George W. Bush, with the Economic Stimulus Act providing individual tax relief in the form of tax rebates. The payments did not start until late April.\n\nThe current stimulus checks, if approved, would be part of the $1-trillion \"phase three\" package, following the \"phase two\" bill signed by Trump on Wednesday. The aid package also includes paid sick and family leave, free coronavirus testing, bolstered unemployment insurance, student loan interest payment hold, and a suspension of foreclosures and evictions on FHA-insured mortgages by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nFurther details on the financial assistance efforts and the timeline for the stimulus checks are subject to change during the appropriations process in Congress.",
    " Title: California Assembly Bill 5 Threatens to Reshape Gig Economy, Heads to Governor's Desk\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have passed Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), a legislation that could significantly alter the business models of companies like Uber and Lyft. The bill, which was passed in the state Assembly in a 61-16 vote, now heads to Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom's desk.\n\nAB5 aims to reclassify gig economy workers as employees instead of contractors. If signed into law, this bill would require companies like Uber and Lyft to provide benefits such as minimum wage, insurance, and sick days to their workers.\n\nUber and Lyft have stated that AB5 will not immediately change the status of their independent contractors to employees. Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, said on a call with reporters that the bill builds on legal tests already established in California regarding worker classification. West suggested that drivers may not necessarily fall under the new rules outlined in AB5.\n\nUnder the three-part test, a company must prove that contractors are doing work \"outside the usual course\" of its business. West stated that several previous rulings have found that drivers' work is outside the usual course of Uber's business, which is serving as a technology platform for various digital marketplaces.\n\nUber and Lyft have informed their drivers that they may need to implement shifts if workers are classified as employees. This would limit when ride-hailing drivers can start and stop accepting rides. In a notice to drivers, Lyft also stated that drivers might only be allowed to work for one ride-hailing service at a time.\n\nGovernor Newsom has been engaged in talks with Uber, Lyft, and other gig economy companies about possible negotiations around the bill. Newsom is expected to sign the bill, after voicing support for it earlier this month.\n\nAB5 has received broad support from Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris, as well as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The bill has the potential to affect more than 1 million low-wage workers in California, not just gig workers at companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Postmates, and Instacart.\n\nIn response to the bill, Uber and Lyft have proposed establishing a $21-an-hour minimum wage for drivers in California. The ride-hailing companies, as well as DoorDash, have also pledged $90 million on a ballot initiative for the 2020 election that would exempt them from AB5. Uber and Lyft are open to investing more on the initiative and are working to include other businesses that face similar issues with AB5.",
    " Title: Prosecutors Leave Open Possibility of New Charges Against Manafort for Lying\n\nArticle:\n\nThe special counsel's team, led by Robert Mueller, has left open the possibility of filing new charges against Paul Manafort for lying during his interviews with the special counsel's office. Manafort's lawyers have stated that he believes he was honest during these interviews.\n\nThe filing was signed by Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor known for his aggressive approach, who has been a target of President Trump's criticism. On Friday, President Trump tweeted, \"He wrongly destroyed people's lives,\" referring to Weissmann.\n\nThis filing concludes a busy week for Mueller's team. On Friday, they also filed a sentencing recommendation for Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer. The prosecutors accused Cohen of using his power and influence \"for deceptive ends\" and sought about four years in prison for him when he is sentenced next week. Cohen is facing charges for lying to Congress about the extent of President Trump's business dealings in Moscow, as well as for campaign finance violations and other charges.\n\nManafort, who was convicted by a Northern Virginia jury in August of eight counts of financial fraud, agreed to a plea deal on the verge of a second trial. However, the special counsel's office declared that he had violated the plea agreement.\n\nThe prosecutors have previously accused Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a Russian they claim Manafort was in touch with, of ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik, a Russian Army-trained linguist, served as Manafort's right-hand man in Ukraine for over a decade, working on behalf of the country's Russia-aligned former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, his party, and the oligarchs behind it.\n\nIn Friday's filing, prosecutors blacked out much of the information related to Kilimnik, but revealed that some of it had been uncovered in emails and testimony. They claimed that Manafort lied about various interactions and meetings with him, as well as his involvement with witnesses who might testify against Manafort.",

An anonymous Democratic official also reported similar experiences. They all stated that this level of DNC involvement in caucus results has not occurred in previous elections.\n\nIn a series of tweets Tuesday evening, DNC chairman Tom Perez expressed that DNC staffers were \"assisting\" the Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) to ensure the results are released as soon and as accurately as possible. Perez emphasized the importance of counting all votes and maintaining accuracy.\n\nThe IDP has been in turmoil since Monday night, when an app commissioned by the IDP and created by Shadow Inc. to streamline the process of reporting caucus results malfunctioned, causing problems for precinct chairs across the state when downloading or logging into the app. As of Wednesday afternoon, only 71 percent of results had been released by the IDP, and IDP chairman Troy Price has refused to provide a timeline for when the remaining 29 percent of results will be verified and made public.\n\n\"We're going to take the time we need to get these results done,\" Price said Tuesday.

    " Title: White Men in Ohio Favor Bernie Sanders in Economic Discontent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary race, Bernie Sanders' victory in Michigan last week has shifted the narrative, with white men playing a significant role in his success. If Sanders manages to win in Ohio, this demographic is likely to remain crucial.\n\nJim, a self-proclaimed \"angry white man\" who requested anonymity due to his union, AFSCME, endorsing Hillary Clinton, expressed his support for Sanders. \"We're pissed off,\" Jim said. \"We haven't gotten raises. Our pensions have been cut. Our healthcare's increased.\" He added, \"Bernie, he speaks from the trenches.\"\n\nIn Michigan, Sanders won the support of 62 percent of white men, who comprised one-third of voters, according to exit polls. In the 2008 Democratic primary in Ohio, white men turned out in similar proportions.\n\nBlack voters could make up a smaller proportion of the electorate and may not be enough to secure a win for Clinton. In Michigan, Clinton won more than two-thirds of black voters, who were 21 percent of the electorate. In 2008, Barack Obama won nearly 90 percent of black voters in Ohio, who were 18 percent of the electorate, with Clinton winning the state with the support of white voters, including white men.\n\nRyan, a member of a building trades union in Cleveland who also requested anonymity due to his union's endorsement of Clinton, shares Jim's sentiments. \"She's [Clinton] seen as the centrist candidate,\" Ryan said. \"And she's a big-money candidate. And big money and centrism hasn't been working for middle-class America for the past 30 years.\"\n\nWhen Ryan first saw Sanders speak a few months ago, something resonated. He felt as if a politician was finally saying what he had been thinking about the state of the country. Ryan was so swayed he even sent a small donation to Sanders' campaign and later bought a T-shirt.\n\nAt a union hall in Cleveland, both Jim and Ryan discussed rising healthcare costs and trade deals they believe have hurt more than helped. Sanders overwhelmingly won voters in Michigan who thought trade deals cost American jobs\u201458 percent of voters said so, and Sanders won them 2-to-1.\n\nJim stated he's only received one raise, really more like a cost-of-living adjustment, in eight years. \"You look at the stock market,\" he said, \"it's gone up I don't know how many, a couple of hundred percent. You know, my wages have gone up 2-and-a-half percent. And who's speaking to that? Bernie is.\"\n\nSanders' attacks on Clinton's trade record, her superPAC, and her big money speeches to Wall Street banks are resonating. The money issue is a concern for Dave Passalacqua. He appreciates that Sanders gets his campaign cash from regular people.\n\nPassalacqua is the executive vice president of the Communications Workers of America Local 4340 in Cleveland. His union has endorsed Sanders, but he's still undecided.\n\nPassalacqua agreed to meet at a Cleveland diner with Jim Goggin, a fixture in the city's labor community. Goggin, an organizer for the Delaware Valley Health Care Coalition, expressed doubts about Sanders' promises. \"It's pie in the sky,\" Goggin said. \"I mean, everything Bernie says, I think would be fantastic. But the fact of the matter is, that I am also a realist, and I know that you can't do that.\"\n\nFor Goggin, the priority is defeating the Republicans in November. \"And I wish to God that I thought he could win,\" Goggin said. \"But I don't unfortunately think he can win. Consequently, I'm with Hillary, because at least she's not going to throw us under the bus, the working people.\"\n\nPassalacqua added, \"And one good thing that Bernie's been doing, though, even with Hillary, is Bernie has moved Hillary's positions on things.\"\n\nDespite their doubts, all four men interviewed stated they would support the Democratic nominee in November. Passalacqua expressed a classic voter's struggle between his head and his heart, unsure if Sanders can deliver on his promises. \"Whoever I think is going best for me and my family is the bottom line,\" Passalacqua said. \"Whoever is going to make\u2014not to steal Donald's line\u2014but America great again, that's who I'll end up having to vote for.\"",
    " Title: A Considered Approach to Coronavirus Reopening Strategy: Controlled Avalanche and Protecting the Vulnerable\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States grapples with the question of how to reopen society amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the debate seems to be dividing into three main groups. The first group believes the virus is not particularly serious and wants a swift reopening, a small minority of Americans according to polling data. The second group views the virus as extraordinarily serious and advocates for prolonged closures, a significant minority of Americans. The third group, comprising the vast majority, acknowledges the severity of the virus, the economic damage caused by the pandemic, and advocates for a measured, considered reopening strategy.\n\nThe question of a considered coronavirus reopening strategy hinges on the assumptions underlying policy recommendations. The primary objective is to minimize deaths, but the assumptions regarding vaccine development timelines, herd immunity, and therapeutic measures are crucial. The economic impact is also a significant factor, with assumptions about the resilience of businesses and the government's ability to shoulder additional debt.\n\nIf the worst-case scenario is assumed\u2014no significant therapeutic advancements, no vaccines for 18 months or more, and an economy functioning at a quarter or half of its normal capacity\u2014a strategy known as controlled avalanche may be the best option. This strategy, proposed by Israeli scientists, involves tranching populations and exposing the least vulnerable to COVID-19 to develop antibodies, similar to the controlled avalanches created by ski resorts to prevent major avalanches.\n\nData suggests that a significant portion of COVID-19 deaths in the European Union and in California have occurred in nursing homes. If authorities had adequately protected nursing homes, the infection fatality rate across the industrialized world could be half of the current rate. The infection fatality rate for COVID-19 also varies widely by age, with a low number of deaths among those under 45 and under 25, and most deaths occurring in individuals with underlying conditions.\n\nIsraeli scientists propose protecting the elderly and vulnerable and allowing herd immunity to develop among the least vulnerable, which could significantly reduce overall mortality, reduce the number of people requiring intensive care units (ICUs), and shorten the time needed to allow low-risk populations freedom by months.\n\nWhile this strategy is not foolproof, it may offer a better approach than simply hoping for the best while the world economy collapses, even as the hope for a deus ex machina may remain unfulfilled. The key to a considered reopening strategy lies in understanding and addressing the underlying assumptions that guide policy recommendations.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Abandons Defense of ACA, Potentially Affecting Pre-Existing Condition Protections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to withdraw its defense of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in an ongoing court challenge could potentially impact the law's popular provisions regarding pre-existing conditions. This move intensifies the ongoing health care debate during an election year.\n\nIn February, 20 states sued the federal government, claiming the individual mandate is unconstitutional after Congress zeroed out the tax penalty for not having health insurance in its 2017 tax cut law. The lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, argues that without an individual mandate, the entire ACA is unconstitutional.\n\nIf this argument prevails in the courts, it would render unconstitutional Obamacare provisions that ban insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, as many as 130 million adults under age 65 in the U.S. have pre-existing conditions that could potentially prevent them from obtaining insurance coverage in the private market.\n\nBefore the ACA became law, insurance companies routinely declined health insurance coverage to people with ongoing medical conditions or recent illnesses. Even when insurers offered policies to those with health problems, they often excluded those illnesses. Insurance companies could also cancel coverage for people who became ill once the policy year ended.\n\nThe ACA made all those practices illegal. By withdrawing from defending the law in court, the Trump administration is effectively stating that it no longer supports these consumer protections, which are popular with voters. This move could disrupt insurance markets for next year and change the dynamic of this fall's elections.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, states, \"This suit comes as insurers are proposing individual market premiums for 2019. The lawsuit injects more uncertainty into what is already an uncertain environment for insurers. Insurers hate uncertainty, and they respond to it by hedging their bets and increasing premiums.\"\n\nNicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School who was a Justice Department lawyer, finds the move troubling. \"The Justice Department has a long-standing, durable, bipartisan commitment to defend acts of Congress. It's a cornerstone of what they do. For the Trump administration to crumple that up and throw it out the window is galling,\" he says.\n\nJust hours before the Justice Department officially withdrew from the case, three of the staff attorneys who had been working on it withdrew. Bagley notes, \"These are civil servants. They're not political. They are good soldiers. Their job is to defend federal programs.\" He adds, \"They believed they could not in good conscience, consistent with their professional obligations, sign the brief. These are people who defend programs they disagree with all the time.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has opted not to defend existing law in the courts in other matters. For instance, in 2012, the Obama Justice Department said it would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which legally defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman for federal purposes.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, the trade association for health insurance companies, supports the pre-existing condition protections under the ACA. \"Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019,\" AHIP said in a statement.\n\nAHIP plans to file an amicus brief in support of the law that \"provides more detail about the harm that would come to millions of Americans if the request to invalidate the ACA is granted in whole or in part.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans' reaction to the Trump administration's decision was muted, with many lawmakers voicing skepticism that the courts would ultimately rule against a law already upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"We need to let that go forward and see if it goes anywhere,\" said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. \"I do not know if that legal logic will fly or not.\" MacArthur worked on legislation to continue pre-existing condition protections during the GOP's unsuccessful effort to repeal Obamacare last year.\n\nHealth care is already a dominant issue in this year's elections, with voters regularly citing it as a leading determinant for how they will vote. \"There is no doubt that Republicans are responsible for the rising cost of healthcare premiums and the high likelihood that many will no longer be able to afford basic care at all, and they will face serious blowback in the midterms,\" the House Democrats' campaign operation said in a statement.",
    " Title: CNN's Brian Stelter Criticizes Republican Candidates for Using Media Bias Claims to Deflect Questions and Increase Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a piece during Thursday's AC360, CNN's senior media correspondent, Brian Stelter, discussed the tactic of Republican presidential candidates using claims of media bias to deflect tough questions and increase polarization among the electorate.\n\nStelter began by stating that it is a common strategy for Republican politicians to make claims of media bias, which he referred to as a \"shield and a sword.\" He suggested that this tactic is not because the liberal media is inherently biased, but rather to deflect unwelcome questions and to project strength by putting the press on the defensive.\n\nDuring the CNBC debate on Wednesday night, Stelter noted that several candidates effectively employed media bashing, and raising the issue made for easy applause lines in front of conservative audiences.\n\nStelter acknowledged that most journalists strive to remove any and all bias from their stories, but he added that many conservatives are skeptical of this claim. He then criticized conservatives for contributing to political polarization in America by not aligning with the media.\n\nAccording to Stelter, the result of this lack of alignment is more political polarization, as per a Pew Research Center study that indicates the more conservative one is, the fewer mainstream media sources one trusts. Fox News and some candidates have benefited from this trend, Stelter argued.\n\nStelter questioned if the questions posed by CNBC were any tougher than those posed by Fox News or CNN, and he quoted University of Virginia's Larry Sabato, who defended the CNBC moderators for trying to uncover the truth. Sabato stated, \"Some of the criticism is for show. What those moderators at CNBC were trying to do was to get candidates to tell more of the truth.\"\n\nThe relevant transcript from CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 on October 29 can be found below.",
    " Title: North Korea Conducts Sixth Nuclear Test, Boosting Weapon Capabilities and Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has conducted its sixth nuclear test, reportedly detonating a hydrogen bomb with a yield of approximately 100 kilotons, making it seven times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The test, which took place on September 3 at the Punggye-ri testing site, was followed by a series of strong reactions from regional allies and the international community.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey registered a 6.3-magnitude earthquake at the testing site, indicating the detonation of a hydrogen bomb. Experts, including Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on North Korea's missile program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, estimate that the device is around seven times stronger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This test marks North Korea's first nuclear test during the Trump administration.\n\nHours before the test, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea's state-run media organization, released images of the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, overseeing the loading of a hydrogen bomb onto an intercontinental ballistic missile. After the test, KCNA stated that the test was conducted to \"examine and confirm the accuracy and credibility\" of the weapon.\n\nJeffrey Lewis stated, \"North Korea wants the ability to target the United States. A thermonuclear weapon does more damage.\" Vipin Narang, a nuclear expert at MIT, added that even with relatively inaccurate intercontinental ballistic missile technology, North Korea can destroy the better part of a city with this yield.\n\nFollowing the test, President Donald Trump tweeted his displeasure, stating, \"North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.\" Trump also claimed that China has had \"little success\" in stopping North Korea's nuclear program and that South Korea's \"talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis offered a stern warning to North Korea after a meeting of national security leaders with the president. \"Any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam, or our allies, will be met with a massive military response\u2014a response both effective and overwhelming,\" he said.\n\nRegional allies South Korea and Japan also reacted strongly. South Korean President Moon Jae-in convened a meeting of his national security team, and his national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, stated that Seoul wants the \"most powerful sanctions\" placed on North Korea at the United Nations.\n\nJapan sent out a statement of disapproval, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stating, \"It is absolutely unacceptable if North Korea did force another nuclear test, and we must protest strongly.\" On August 29, North Korea launched a missile into Japanese airspace that eventually landed about 733 miles east of the country.\n\nIt remains unclear if the Japanese government finds North Korea's latest nuclear test more threatening than the missile launch. Trump could respond with a military strike, but that is still unlikely. The Trump administration still prefers a diplomatic approach toward Pyongyang in hopes that it would give up its nuclear weapons. However, it is unclear what incentive North Korea has to stop its nuclear program, especially now that it has tested a powerful hydrogen bomb. This will make it much harder for Trump to strike a deal with the North.",
    " Title: Illinois State Workers Receive Automatic Pay Raise Amidst Unemployment Crisis; Federal Aid to States Debated\n\nArticle:\n\nOn July 1, Illinois state workers received an automatic pay raise, costing taxpayers $261 million. This move comes as nearly 1.4 million Illinois residents have filed for unemployment since the COVID-19 pandemic forced widespread economic shutdowns in March.\n\nWhile some state governments have implemented cost-cutting measures in response to significant revenue shortfalls, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker signed a budget that increases spending by $2.4 billion over the previous year and relies on $5 billion from a nonexistent federal bailout to partially address a $6 billion deficit.\n\nIn contrast, governors in Washington, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia have implemented measures such as canceled pay raises, furloughs, and 15% agency spending cuts for fiscal year 2021. The ongoing debate in Congress regarding additional aid to state and local governments, with a potential new coronavirus relief package expected this month, highlights the polarized views on the issue.\n\nSome on the right are philosophically opposed to offering aid to struggling states, while the left advocates for up to $1 trillion in additional aid without regard for the actual amount needed or safeguards for the funds. The recession and pandemic have created legitimate challenges for government finances, but a compromise solution could avoid rewarding irresponsible behavior in states with a history of financial mismanagement.\n\nCongress can offer more aid, but only if it is conditioned on sound financial management to protect taxpayers from tax increases or service failures. Attaching \"strings\" to financial rescues is a common practice, as seen in relief packages following the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the 2007-2009 U.S. bank bailouts, and the corporate financial assistance under the recently passed CARES Act.\n\nTo ensure good money isn't wasted, conditions should be placed on federal aid to states such as Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut, which have accumulated significant debt burdens due to decades of poor financial decisions unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding should be conditioned on three hallmarks of healthy state finances: sound pensions, truly balanced budgets, and sufficient rainy-day savings.\n\nFirst, states must be on a path to fully eliminating unfunded pension liabilities over no more than 25 years, in line with generally accepted actuarial principles. If a state cannot achieve this, pension liabilities should be reduced to the level the state can afford without increasing employer contributions, i.e., taxpayer costs. States with unsound pension systems should be required to close those systems to new employees in exchange for more sustainable models such as a defined contribution plan or Wisconsin-style risk-sharing systems.\n\nSecond, any state receiving funds should be asked to maintain a truly balanced budget, meaning the fiscal year ends in the black and no deficits are carried over. Illinois is one of just 11 states that does not require end-of-year balance by state law or constitution. Balance should also mean only money actually coming in gets counted as revenue, rather than allowing for Illinois-style gimmicks such as sweeping money from other state funds or relying on short-term borrowing to paper over deficits.\n\nLastly, states should have restrictions on rainy-day fund withdrawals to ensure they are only used in emergencies and have rules for automatic deposits when the economy returns to growth. The federal government should not be expected to bail out states in every future recession, and that means states must have sufficient emergency savings of their own.\n\nWithout these reforms and proof of effort by state governments, fiscally irresponsible states would use aid money in an inefficient and ineffective manner \u2013 just as they've done with their own mismanaged funds for decades. Federal lawmakers have a significant opportunity in front of them: they can provide aid to ensure the people have access to essential government services while encouraging mismanaged states to fix their tumbledown fiscal houses.",

    " Title: FBI Email Review Resurfaces Clinton Email Scandal, Altering Presidential Race Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential campaign, described as the most unpredictable, surprising, and contentious in modern times, is entering its final full week. The race has taken a dramatic turn as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who previously seemed to be on a path to historical victory, now faces renewed scrutiny over her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nThe FBI's review of new emails from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin found on the computer of her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, ensures that an issue that has dogged Clinton since the beginning of her campaign will remain at the forefront until the election.\n\nDemocrats are expressing frustration with FBI Director James Comey for reopening the investigation, while Republican nominee Donald Trump is seizing the opportunity to unite a Republican base that has been divided by his controversial candidacy.\n\nSome surveys suggest a tightening race, though CNN's Poll of Polls currently has Clinton ahead by five points. The question now is whether this late-in-the-game twist will bring a final, shocking turn\u2014a November surprise\u2014before the campaign concludes.\n\nClinton, who was previously cleared of any criminal charges in July regarding her use of a private email server, now faces renewed criticism and questions about her honesty, secrecy, and involvement in scandals. Clinton's campaign is responding by shifting its focus to attacking Trump, in line with their campaign-long effort to portray him as unfit for the presidency due to his moral and intellectual shortcomings.\n\nClinton will travel to Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina in the coming days, where she is in a tight race with Trump, and North Carolina where she is leading. By winning any one of these states, Clinton can block Trump's path to the presidency. She will also make a foray into Arizona, a traditionally red state that appears competitive a week out.\n\nClinton will also leverage her advantage over Trump by dispatching former President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, and First Lady Michelle Obama to battleground states. However, Clinton's campaign faces nervous days ahead, with the potential for further damaging twists in the email saga, more WikiLeaks releases of John Podesta's emails, and the scheduled release of more Clinton emails from the State Department on Friday.\n\nMany Democrats believe the character issue is already baked into polls that show Clinton as the favorite to win the election. However, her plans for a smooth run to Election Day have been disrupted, and her campaign has been forced into a tactical shift, unleashing its full fury on the FBI chief.\n\n``This is something that has been tossed into the middle of the campaign,'' Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta said on \"State of the Union.\" ``We would have preferred that that not happen, but now that it has happened, Mr. Comey really needs to come forward and explain why he took this unprecedented step.''\n\nHowever, spending time attacking the FBI director is time that could be used to make a closing argument for Clinton or to attack Trump. For the moment, Clinton is using the move as a rallying cry to drive up Democratic turnout.\n\n``There have been ups and downs in all that we have gone through over the years and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you,'' Clinton told supporters in Florida on Sunday. ``There's a lot of noise and distraction, but really comes down to what kind of future we want.''\n\nIn the hours after Comey's Friday bombshell, Trump and his aides could barely contain their glee. A campaign that had seemed headed for certain defeat grabbed gratefully onto the late October gift, immediately using the revelations to bolster Trump's theme that Clinton is a crook, broke the law with her email server, and is symptomatic of a corrupt political status quo.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether Trump can effectively use this new information to his advantage in the final days of the campaign. Trump's presidential bid has been plagued by his failure to turn a trove of material detrimental to Clinton into sustained attacks. He has been repeatedly undermined by his own indiscipline and tendency to detonate controversies that harm him more than his opponent.\n\n``The problem with the Trump campaign all along is that they've had lots of potential material, a lot of grist for the mill that he has failed to prosecute,'' said Mark McKinnon, former strategist for President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain on \"State of the Union.\" ``Trump needs to just for once maintain a clear and constant focus for the next 10 days on the issues that can move the dial.''\n\nTo mount a stunning comeback on November 8, Trump must also improve his position on the political map. He must forge ahead in Florida and Ohio, cut his deficit to Clinton in North Carolina, capitalize on an advantage in Iowa, then find a way to put states like New Hampshire and Nevada, that went for Obama, in play. He could carve out a decisive edge by making a big blue state like Pennsylvania or Michigan competitive\u2014though polls suggest that is a long shot.\n\nBut Trump's team must also be wondering, even as they salivate over Clinton's woes, if there is one last big shock awaiting Trump, following October Surprise controversies over claims he sexually assaulted women and an \"Access Hollywood\" tape exposing his lewd language that left him so far behind his rival that he starts the campaign's last week possibly too far behind to catch up.",
    " Title: Terrorism and Cultural Tensions: A Comparative Analysis of the U.S. and France\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent terrorist attacks in Orlando, Florida, and the previous incidents in San Bernardino and Paris have raised concerns about the global threat of Islamic extremism. The source of these attacks, whether they are lone wolf attacks or coordinated by terrorist organizations like ISIS, remains uncertain.\n\nThe United States and France are both grappling with the aftermath of these attacks, with the U.S. experiencing a sense of being under siege due to the recent Islamic extremist terrorism incidents. However, it is important to note that the U.S. is also suffering from an epidemic of domestic violence, such as the mass shootings in Dallas, Roseburg, Charleston, Newtown, and Aurora.\n\nFrance, on the other hand, appears to be the epicenter for ISIS-coordinated terrorism, as opposed to lone wolf or locally inspired splinter groups. This is attributed to France's long colonial history in the Middle East, its experience in Algeria, and its traditional cultural intolerance. The country has the largest Muslim population in Europe, and its insistence on strict adaptation to French mores has created a combustible mixture in a dangerous time.\n\nThe U.S., despite its horrific history, has generally been one of the best at assimilating culturally diverse populations. Muslims were easily accepted into American society for many decades, but post-9/11, this acceptance has waned. There are now reports of profiling and investigations of Muslims, as well as protests against the building of mosques.\n\nFrance, however, is in the midst of a serious homegrown Islamic terrorism crisis. The country's people are grappling with the extent of their tolerance, and there are concerns about draconian solutions. In the U.S., despite a different scale of violence, there is a political figure, Donald Trump, who is advocating for drastic measures such as banning Muslims and building a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico and Central America.\n\nDespite these challenges, both countries' underlying commitment to diversity remains, and American Muslims still believe in it. The hope is that these radical extremists are sowing the seeds of their own demise by bringing the world together in solidarity rather than inciting people to turn on one another. The empathy felt by the vast majority of the human population in the face of these attacks is a testament to our common humanity.",
    " Title: Democratic Party Faces Potential Internal Strife as Republican Party Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman suggested that the Republican Party might need to \"crash and burn\" to give way to a more \"sane\" version of the party. This perspective, shared by some Democratic establishment figures and media personalities, envisions a one-party political landscape in the United States.\n\nWhile it is not inaccurate to predict or advocate for such a scenario, it is important to recognize that such daydreams overlook a significant factor: both parties may face internal strife and potential civil wars.\n\nThe Republican Party's internal divide, exacerbated by the Donald Trump presidency, is undeniable. However, the Democratic Party may also face significant challenges, particularly if a Democrat resides in the White House, especially an unpopular figure like Hillary Clinton.\n\nOne source of potential conflict within the Democratic Party stems from the 2016 primary election. Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters believe that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rigged the primary process against him. The resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, following the first WikiLeaks revelation, and the expected departure of interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, following the second such revelation, underscore this belief.\n\nSanders has also announced his intention to oppose government action, including laws or policies not sufficiently leftist, which could put him at odds with Hillary Clinton, particularly on economic and regulatory issues. Additionally, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who endorsed Clinton in June, holds views on economic policy and business regulation that mirror Sanders' to a significant extent.\n\nAnother potential source of conflict within the Democratic Party concerns Supreme Court nominations. Hillary Clinton might face pressure to select a nominee who aligns with the views of Sanders and Warren, risking a Republican filibuster. Alternatively, she might choose a more moderate nominee to secure Republican support, which could lead to internal discord within the Democratic Party.\n\nA vocal minority of the Democratic base, including some who supported Green Party candidate Jill Stein, opposes much of Clinton's agenda. This faction, much like Trump supporters, is ideological and unwilling to compromise, potentially leading to contentious debates within the party.\n\nUnlike Trump supporters, however, these progressive Democrats' debates may take place in the public eye, given their opposition to Clinton. This could make Clinton's presidency a tumultuous four years, with the Democratic infighting serving as a notable contrast to what is expected to be a relatively uneventful term in office.",
    " Title: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo Addresses Human Life Value and Abortion in Press Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, during a recent press conference discussing the gradual reopening of the state, addressed the value of human life and the inconsistencies in policies related to abortion.\n\nIn his speech, Cuomo rhetorically asked, \"How much is a human life worth?\" He continued, stating, \"That is the real discussion that no one is admitting, openly or freely. That we should. To me, I say the cost of a human life\u2014a human life is priceless. Period.\"\n\nThe governor's comments come amidst concerns about nursing home policies and the continued operation of abortion clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, Cuomo expanded legal abortion in New York, an action that was celebrated with the lighting of the Freedom Tower and the bridge named after his father. Last year, he also expressed support for legalizing assisted suicide in the state.\n\nDuring the quarantine, New York State has also become a surrogacy state, a move that has been met with opposition from a coalition of pro-lifers and liberal feminists, who argue that it can lead to the exploitation of women.\n\nThe Sisters of Life, a Catholic religious community based in New York, have been approached by women, including those inside abortion clinics, who feel they have no choice but to undergo abortions due to the pressure in their lives. The Sisters of Life advocate for the pricelessness of every human life, emphasizing that each person is chosen by a Creator who loves them and created them in His image and likeness.\n\nGovernor Cuomo's comments have sparked discussions about the inconsistencies in policies related to human life, and calls for open and honest discussions about the value of life and the need for consistency in policies.",
    " Title: Dreamers Express Disappointment as Democratic Leaders Delay Dream Act Push to Early 2018\n\nArticle:\n\nIllegal immigrant Dreamers, who had set a year-end deadline for the passage of the Dream Act, expressed disappointment this week as Democratic leaders signaled they would revisit the immigration issue in early 2018. Hundreds of Dreamers, some risking arrest, protested in Congress, demanding the passage of the Dream Act, a bill that would grant temporary legal status to over 2 million illegal immigrants and allow 1.7 million of them to earn green cards.\n\nFinal negotiations were ongoing late Wednesday over the shape of a year-end spending bill, which includes an extension of the government's chief foreign intelligence communications surveillance program, disaster relief for states and U.S. territories affected by this year's hurricanes, and a renewal of the Children's Health Insurance Program. The biggest moving part, however, is a year-end spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown when current funding expires on Friday.\n\nHouse Republicans have proposed full-year funding for the Defense Department coupled with a four-week extension of current funding for domestic needs, known as a \"continuing resolution.\" Democrats have said they won't accept this and insist on parity between defense and domestic programs to allocate money for veterans' health, a pension bailout, opioid-fighting programs, and medical research.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, House Republican leaders were still trying to figure out a path forward. Democrats said they were waiting for Republicans. \"Unless we see a respect for our values and priorities, we continue to urge a strong NO on the continuing resolution,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, wrote in a letter to her troops.\n\nRank-and-file Republicans complained that Democrats were pushing Congress toward a government shutdown by threatening an all-or-nothing Senate filibuster. \"The American people sent us the Republican majorities in the House, the Senate, and the White House. And we have to get eight votes on the Democrat side, and we should compromise, right? But it should be proportional to Democratic Senate votes,\" said Rep. Dave Brat, Virginia Republican.\n\nUsually, it's Republicans facing calls for a shutdown showdown from their right flank. But the Dreamers flipped the script, forcing Democrats into a tight spot by demanding a permanent fix after President Trump announced a phaseout of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deportation amnesty. Trump's phaseout kicks in on March 5, but Dreamers set an artificial end-of-year deadline, and Democratic leaders initially agreed, though some have since backed off their red line.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been a leading voice for Dreamers, said he believed his party's leaders in the House were holding firm in their DACA demand and that some Senate Democrats were also adamant. However, he was less sure about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat. \"I believe that at this particular moment, the onus is on Sen. Schumer,\" Mr. Gutierrez said. Dreamers were more pointed, saying Mr. Schumer was betraying them.\n\nDreamers and their defenders did not blame only Democratic leaders; several dozen Republicans said they wanted a DACA solution this year. Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has been pushing for the Dream Act, said Wednesday that he has assurances the DACA issue will be taken up in January. He said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, \"has committed to bring the bipartisan DACA bill we are currently negotiating to the Senate floor\" next month.\n\nMr. Gutierrez said Dreamers can't bank on another promise. \"It's very easy for Sen. Flake to send out a tweet this morning and say, 'Dreamers in January.' His kids aren't getting deported. He's going home to his wife. He's celebrating Christmas,\" he said.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Announces New Gun Control Measures, Including Restrictions on Military Surplus Weapons Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration announced two new gun control measures on Thursday, including one that would curb the import of military surplus weapons. The new rules, announced while Washington was otherwise focused on the crisis in Syria, took the form of executive actions, which President Obama added to the list of 23 steps the White House already determined the president could take on his own.\n\nThe steps come after Congress declined to pass any gun control legislation earlier this year despite an aggressive White House push for action in the wake of the Newton, Conn., shooting massacre. With the political world focused on Mideast tensions and looming fiscal battles, the move signaled Obama's intent to show he has not lost sight of the issue.\n\nOne new policy will end a government practice that lets military weapons, sold or donated by the U.S. to allies, be reimported into the U.S. by private entities. The White House said the U.S. has approved 250,000 of those guns to be reimported since 2005; under the new policy, only museums and a few other entities like the government will be eligible to reimport military-grade firearms.\n\nThe Obama administration is also proposing a federal rule to stop those who would be ineligible to pass a background check from skirting the law by registering a gun to a corporation or trust. The new rule would require people associated with those entities, like beneficiaries and trustees, to undergo the same type of fingerprint-based background checks as individuals if they want to register guns.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) said that neither measure would reduce crime, since neither the re-importation of firearms nor the corporate gun registration is known to be a source of weapons for criminals.\n\nThe types of surplus weapons that have been re-imported under this provision are all more than 50 years old, and fall under the definition of \"curio\" or \"relic\" firearms. They include M1 Garand rifles and several other models. As such, it is safe to assume that few are used in crimes.\n\nThe event in the Roosevelt Room where Vice President Biden spoke also marked the ceremonial swearing-in for Todd Jones, whose confirmation to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after six years of political wrangling to fill that position was another of Obama's post-Newtown priorities. A Senate deal to approve the president's pending nominations after Democrats threatened to change Senate rules cleared the way for Jones' confirmation last month.\n\nStill out of reach for Obama were the steps that gun control advocates and the administration's own review say could most effectively combat gun violence in the U.S., like an assault weapons ban and fewer exceptions for background checks for individual sales. Only Congress can act on those fronts.\n\nAlthough Obama and Biden have said the fight is not over, there is scant evidence that there is more support for gun control legislation than there was in April, when efforts died in the Senate amid staunch opposition from the National Rifle Association and most Republican senators.\n\n\"Sooner or later, we are going to get this right,\" Obama said that day in the White House Rose Garden, with the families of Newtown victims and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords -- herself a victim of a gunman -- at his side. \"The memories of these children demand it, and so do the American people,\" the president said at the time.\n\nIn the months following the Senate vote, Biden has claimed that a handful of lawmakers who opposed expanded background checks have told him privately they've changed their minds and want another chance. But Biden and White House officials have not named any of those lawmakers.\n\nThese days, Obama mentions gun control with far less regularity than when it appeared the Senate was poised to take action, although Obama did meet Tuesday with 18 city mayors to discuss ways to contain youth violence. And with immigration and pressing fiscal issues dominating Congress' agenda, the prospects for reviving gun legislation appear negligible. With Jones' confirmation at ATF, the White House has completed or made significant progress on all but one of the 23 executive actions Obama had previously ordered in January, the White House said. Still lingering is an effort to finalize regulations to require insurers to cover mental health at parity with medical benefits, although the White House said that it is committed to making that happen by the end of 2013.\n\nThe new rules for guns registered to corporations will follow the traditional regulatory process, with a 90-day comment period before ATF reviews suggestions and finalizes the rule. Last year, ATF received 39,000 requests to register guns to corporations and trusts.",
    " Title: China Steps into Void Left by U.S. Withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has caused global anger and anxiety, with one notable exception: China. With the U.S. stepping away from its role as a leader in the global fight against climate change, Beijing is moving to fill the void, providing it with opportunities for both diplomatic and economic gains.\n\nThis is not the first time President Trump, who campaigned on demonizing China, has inadvertently given Beijing a significant opportunity to expand its global standing. After the U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, China inserted itself into trade talks among other nations disappointed by America's reversal. As Canada and Mexico have felt spurned by Trump during the runup to renegotiating NAFTA, China has emerged as a more reliable trading partner.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Chinese President Xi Jinping criticized the West for its flirtation with protectionism and painted a picture of China as a champion of free trade and an attractive destination for foreign investment. As the U.S. withdraws from the global community's effort to curb carbon emissions, China's profile as a forward-thinking world leader will only grow. It is set to become closer to the U.S.'s allies that feel abandoned by Trump's recent actions, as well as take a more aggressive lead in building a green economy.\n\nAlex Wang, an environmental law professor at the University of California Los Angeles, stated, \"While the U.S. is breaking these ties, China \u2014 which has traditionally been more reserved in international affairs \u2014 is building them at breakneck pace. As the U.S. loses goodwill, China is building it.\"\n\nThe reshuffling of the world order in the wake of Trump's announcement could be seen almost immediately, with top Chinese and European leaders criticizing the U.S.'s withdrawal side by side on Thursday. Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that \"fighting climate change is a global consensus\" and pledged that China would remain committed to the Paris agreement. Merkel said, \"The cooperation of the European Union with China in this area will play a crucial role, especially in regards to new technologies.\"\n\nIn a statement to the press, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union commissioner on climate action and energy, made the point even more forcefully: \"No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward. Our successful cooperation on issues like emissions trading and clean technologies are bearing fruit. Now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action.\"\n\nIt won't be the last time that Beijing and Brussels find themselves seeing eye to eye, or that the two sides look past the U.S. and look to work on joint initiatives that don't involve Washington. And Europe and China's enhanced cooperation is quite likely to go beyond coordinating on climate change.\n\n\"These agreements... build ties and align interests in ways that reduce the likelihood of conflict and bolster the opportunities for greater growth and development,\" Wang says.\n\nIf Europe and China are actually able to grow closer through their coordination on climate change, it could potentially build a better relationship for navigating conflicts over trade. In the meantime, the U.S. and Europe are going through the roughest patch they've had since they split over the Iraq War in 2003. Even before Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement on Thursday, he had already alienated Europe during his trip abroad last week, when he, among other things, refused to reaffirm America's commitment to NATO and accused Germany of being a trade cheat.\n\nTrump's America First agenda has been a huge gift to China. The impact of Trump's withdrawal from the world stage is bigger than China's relationship with Europe. Consider how, on his first full working day as president, he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that would have boosted trade ties between the U.S. and 11 countries along the Pacific Rim and generated the largest trade bloc the world had ever seen. The accord would have strengthened ties between the U.S. and a number of China's neighbors and would have served as a counterweight to Beijing's increasing influence in the region (China was not part of the deal). Now, Trump's move means that Beijing has a major opportunity to step into that vacuum and negotiate a regional trade deal that basically serves as a China-centric version of the TPP. It's already making efforts to do exactly that.\n\nChina has generally been eager to capitalize on Trump's protectionist tendencies. In his World Economic Forum speech, Chinese President Xi warned against rising nationalism in the West and defended free trade. This is China lecturing the U.S. and Europe about free trade. China's economy has liberalized significantly in recent decades, but it's a country that flagrantly disregards all kinds of global trade rules, from denying market access to foreign companies to subsidizing many of its key industries. But when you have the most powerful politician in the world calling for 45 percent tariffs against other countries, Xi doesn't look so preposterous.\n\nIf there's one realm where China is set to best the U.S. in the wake of Paris, it's in developing a sustainable economy. It's already investing more than the U.S. in clean energy\u2014in 2016, it invested more than $88 billion to the U.S.'s $59 billion\u2014but the gap between the U.S. and China will grow as the U.S. decides that renewable energy investment isn't a priority. And it will grow fast. America First is turning out to be anything but.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Strikes Down Portions of Affordable Care Act, Leaving Future of Healthcare Program Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge in Texas has ruled that certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, are unconstitutional. The ruling, which is expected to be appealed, could potentially have significant implications for the healthcare coverage of millions of Americans.\n\nIn a 55-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, agreed with a coalition of Republican-led states that the individual mandate, which requires individuals to either purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, is unconstitutional. The judge's decision was based on the elimination of the penalty for not having health insurance, a provision of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul passed by Congress last December.\n\nThe ruling is likely to be appealed by California and other states to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is dominated by Republican-appointed judges. The expected lengthy court fight between Republican and Democratic state officials over the ruling could potentially end up at the Supreme Court, which has twice previously voted to uphold other challenges to the ACA.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump hailed the ruling as \"great news for America,\" the White House acknowledged that the law remains in place while the lawsuit is appealed. Trump, who has long criticized the ACA, called on Congress to pass a \"STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare.\" In a statement, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become House Speaker in January, expressed no interest in compromise and vowed to intervene in the appeals process when Democrats take control of the House next month.\n\nThe ruling has no immediate effect, and consumers who buy insurance through federal or state marketplaces can still purchase 2019 coverage through Saturday. If the ruling is upheld after the appeal process, however, subsidies that people collect to buy health coverage would no longer be available, and Medicaid, which has extended insurance coverage to millions of low-income and working-class Americans, could also be in jeopardy.\n\nMany GOP candidates took care to champion the pre-existing conditions aspect of the law during the midterm elections. In a signal of the shifting public opinion in favor of the 2010 law, Trump stressed in his latest tweet that any new program should include a ban on health insurers denying coverage to people based on pre-existing conditions. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 52 million adults from 18 to 64, or 27 percent of that age group, would be denied coverage under the practices that were in effect in most states before the ACA was passed.",
    " Title: The Shift in American Voter Engagement and the Importance of Participatory Democracy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe presidential election cycle in the United States appears to be progressing earlier each round, mirroring the holiday shopping season. As the election cycle unfolds, American voters prepare to exercise their civic duty by dusting off their voting identification cards.\n\nWhile active participation in the democratic political process is essential, the majority of political engagement occurs through social media discussions and printed press editorials. Participatory democracy has transformed into an online argument, often marked by name-calling and political polarization.\n\nThe American voter's political engagement is primarily focused on the presidential race, with the excitement, vitriol, and participation being a recurring feature of every four-year or two-year contested race. The average voter turnout for presidential elections is approximately 55%, while midterm elections see an average of 45% turnout.\n\nThe article suggests that political solutions and a functioning democracy rely on the active participation of the voter. The current political process has been likened to reality television, with the media coverage of the 2016 presidential election serving as a potential means to engage the American voter. Instead of relying on presidential candidates to solve the nation's problems, the electorate should be more active in local, congressional, midterm, and gubernatorial elections.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of participatory democracy, which extends beyond casting a vote. It involves encouraging thoughtful discussions on important issues, donating time and money to organizations that support a healthy democratic process, and engaging in dialogue with neighbors to foster a bipartisan society and political process.\n\nThe author, Barrio, is a native New Mexican and recent New Mexico State University graduate who has been covering Southwest music culture through various online music publications. He has a passion for political activism and public discourse. The article concludes by highlighting the need for American citizens to move beyond selective news consumption and engage in meaningful dialogue to address pressing issues such as economic prosperity, national security, the environment, and societal division.",
    " Title: House Energy and Commerce Committee Rejects Climate Change Acknowledgement Amendment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee spent a significant portion of Tuesday discussing and voting on The Electricity Security and Affordability Act, a bill that aims to suspend the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed climate rules for power plants. The committee also rejected an amendment that would have acknowledged the reality of climate change.\n\nRepresentative Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) introduced the amendment, stating that greenhouse gas pollution \"threatens the American public's health and welfare\" by contributing to climatic changes. ClimateProgress reported that the amendment was rejected, with 24 Energy & Commerce Committee members, all Republicans, voting against it.\n\nIn 2011, House Republicans also voted down amendments that called on Congress to accept that climate change is real, man-made, and a human health threat. The rejection of climate change acknowledgement amendments is not unique to this bill or this committee.\n\nClimateProgress further reported that the Republicans who voted against the amendment have collectively accepted approximately $9.3 million in career contributions from the oil, gas, and coal industries.\n\nIt is unclear why the Republicans on the energy committee continue to reject the acknowledgement of climate change, but the financial ties to the fossil fuel industry may provide one explanation.",
    " Title: \"Americans United for Life Advocates for Comprehensive Regulation of Abortion Clinics\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe grand jury report on Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortionist currently on trial for murder, details allegations of substandard care, dangerous drug overdoses, and unsanitary conditions at his clinic. This incident is not an isolated case, as at least 15 states have launched investigations into abortion clinics and providers over the past three years for substandard care.\n\nAmericans United for Life (AUFL) has been at the forefront of efforts to combat substandard care in abortion clinics. Over the past three years, eight states have enacted new comprehensive abortion clinic regulations or improved existing ones, in response to AUFL's call for protection of women from such clinics.\n\nOne of AUFL's key initiatives is the \"Abortion Patients' Enhanced Safety Act,\" model legislation that mandates abortion clinics meet the same health and safety standards as facilities performing other outpatient surgeries. Alabama recently enacted legislation inspired by this model, and Virginia has approved final regulations for abortion clinics, which are now considered a subset of \"hospitals\" and are required to meet rigorous and protective standards for patient care.\n\nThe debate over Virginia's abortion clinic standards illustrates the ongoing battle to ensure women's health and safety overrides profit margins and unregulated abortion practices. Virginia officials and pro-life advocates argue for licensing, regular inspections, operable emergency equipment, and sanitary facilities. Pro-abortion advocates countered that these standards would force clinics to close due to the cost of compliance.\n\nDespite evidence of substandard conditions in Virginia abortion clinics, pro-abortion advocates refused to acknowledge or contradict this evidence. In response to recurring health and safety violations and the failure of some clinics to fulfill \"plans of correction\" for previously documented violations, a representative from NARAL Virginia wrongly insisted that there was no demonstrated public health need supporting the regulations.\n\nHowever, documentation obtained by the Family Foundation of Virginia from the Virginia Board of Health confirms the widespread continuation of health and safety violations in Virginia's abortion clinics. Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation of Virginia, stated, \"These inspection reports are indisputable evidence that nothing could be further from the truth.\"\n\nThe \"right\" to abortion, as defined by the U.S. Supreme Court, does not grant abortion providers a \"right\" to practice without meaningful oversight and regulation, or to maim and kill women in unlicensed, substandard, and dangerous clinics. Denise M. Burke, vice president of legal affairs at Americans United for Life, emphasizes this point.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Aspirants' Healthcare and Busing Policies Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, several Democratic candidates vying to replace President Donald Trump are facing scrutiny for their healthcare and busing policies, with some drawing comparisons to Trump's own political style.\n\nCalifornia Senator Kamala Harris, one of the presidential hopefuls, has been under fire for her inconsistent stance on private health insurance. If elected and re-elected, Harris might have to address the question of whether Americans should be prohibited from having private health insurance, a system currently serving 18 percent of the U.S. economy.\n\nSeven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris endorsed \"Medicare for All\" and, when asked about private insurance, she stated that everyone would have access to medical care without the need to go through an insurance company. However, her subsequent statements have been described as \"waffling\" regarding private insurance, and she has been criticized for her inconsistency on the issue.\n\nAt the second Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Harris raised her hand when asked if she would abolish private insurance in favor of a government-run plan. This contradicted her later statement on MSNBC, where she claimed she does not support ending private health insurance.\n\nAnother contentious issue for Harris is her stance on school busing, a policy that ended 20 years ago. During a debate with former Vice President Joe Biden, she used busing as a cudgel, but her approach was met with criticism for reviving an unpopular policy that sparked controversy in the 1970s. In a 1973 Gallup poll, only 4 percent of whites and 9 percent of blacks chose busing as a means of achieving integration.\n\nBiden, too, has faced criticism for his evolving stance on political issues. He has been accused of contorting his convictions, such as his recent support for federal funding of abortions, a shift from his previous 40-year support for the Hyde amendment.\n\nThe debate over healthcare and busing policies among Democratic candidates highlights the challenges they face in presenting coherent, consistent, and popular platforms while differentiating themselves from President Trump. The candidates' evolving stances on these issues have led some to accuse them of imitating Trump's political style, with his campaign strategy of labeling America a \"hellhole\" and his inaugural address's depiction of \"American carnage\" being mirrored in their speeches.",
    " Title: Trump Promotes Plastics Production Amidst Corporate America's Environmental Shift\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed his support for plastic production, distinguishing himself from Democrats who have environmental concerns. This stance comes as corporate America, including companies like Google and Coca-Cola, attempt to align with environmentalists, reducing plastic usage and promoting recycling.\n\nIn a recent event, Trump took credit for a new plastic manufacturing plant being built by Royal Dutch Shell in Pennsylvania. However, the plant's planning dates back to 2012, and it was built with over $1 billion in tax credits from state taxpayers.\n\nTrump used the occasion to encourage Pennsylvanians to support his reelection, stating, \"Virtually every leading Democrat has vowed to eliminate fossil fuels.\" The plant will use a byproduct of fracking to produce pellets for various plastic products, including those used in cars and wind turbines.\n\nWhen asked about the excessive use of plastic before his speech at the new plant, Trump attributed the issue to other countries, particularly China. He stated, \"We have tremendous plastics coming over from Asia, from China, and various others. It's not our plastic. It's plastic that's floating over in the ocean and the various oceans from other places.\"\n\nTrump has made strides in addressing plastic waste, signing the bipartisan Save Our Seas Act to combat ocean garbage and plastic. However, he did not mention the word \"plastic\" at the signing event.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's reelection campaign is selling 10-packs of plastic Trump straws on its official website, raising over $450,000. The campaign's website states, \"Liberal paper straws do not work. STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today.\"\n\nCorporate America, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi, is making efforts to reduce plastic waste and improve their environmental images. Coca-Cola produced over 3 million tons of plastic packaging in 2017 and aims to recycle or collect the equivalent of everything it produces by 2030. Both companies have announced plans to sell their water in aluminum cans in addition to plastic bottles.\n\nRecent city laws limiting plastic straws have led to a backlash, prompting the Trump campaign's straw sale. However, some companies are moving away from plastic straws regardless of the laws. Starbucks, for example, has developed a recyclable lid for its iced drinks and is one of several companies phasing out plastic straws. The UK is banning plastic straws by 2020, and companies there are adjusting accordingly. McDonald's moved away from plastic straws in its UK and Ireland stores but found the new paper straws were not recyclable.\n\nGoogle has announced plans to include recycled plastic in its products by 2022, and Amazon, responsible for significant packaging, has moved toward paper-padded packaging that it claims is recyclable. Amazon also has a portion of its website dedicated to its sustainability and environment efforts.\n\nSupport for plastic bag bans, such as New York's ban on single-use plastic bags in grocery stores, has bipartisan backing. However, these bans can only do so much, as demonstrated by China's significant contribution to plastic waste in oceans despite having laws limiting single-use plastic bags.",
    " Title: Stephen Colbert Challenges Elizabeth Warren on Single-Payer Healthcare and Middle Class Taxes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent appearance on Stephen Colbert's CBS late night show, the host questioned Elizabeth Warren on the issue of single-payer healthcare, a policy she supports. Colbert pressed Warren on the potential increase in middle-class taxes to fund the program she and Bernie Sanders have proposed. Warren, seemingly taken aback, evaded the question multiple times.\n\nColbert, in a comedic tone, asked Warren, \"You keep being asked in the debates, how are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle class taxes?\" After a pause, he repeated, \"How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle class taxes?\"\n\nWarren responded by discussing increased costs for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations. However, Colbert interjected, \"Taxes, which is what you mean by 'costs'?\" Warren continued, stating that hardworking middle-class families would see their costs decrease.\n\nColbert then offered Warren advice on how to argue in favor of middle-class tax hikes for the greater good of single-payer healthcare. His critique stemmed from a place of support and agreement, aiming to help Warren present her argument more effectively.\n\nHowever, political experts have noted that openly admitting the need for significant tax increases is a politically risky move. A poll by Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that support for government-run single-payer systems plummeted when voters were presented with the possibility of delays in care or higher taxes, dropping to 26% and 37%, respectively.\n\nAnother challenge for Warren is that her plan would replace private healthcare plans for nearly 180 million Americans, making such coverage illegal. At the last Democratic debate, Warren attempted to downplay this issue by claiming that few Americans love their insurance companies. However, polling suggests that many Americans value their coverage and providers, making such uprooting a significant political liability for single-payer advocates.\n\nAccording to Gallup polling from late last year, 82% of Democrats reported receiving good or excellent healthcare, and 71% believed their health care coverage was good or excellent. Even when it comes to health care costs, 61% of Democrats were satisfied with what they paid. The same poll also noted that the vast majority of all Americans are satisfied with the quality of their health care and their level of coverage.\n\nFurthermore, a recent Kaiser poll found that 86% of Americans with private coverage were satisfied with it. Healthcare disruption is deeply unpopular, as both parties have learned in recent years. Warren may try to navigate around these facts, but she cannot deflect from the issues of higher taxes, illegal private coverage, and potential long wait times for care.",
    " Title: San Francisco Shooting: A Call for Smarter Immigration Enforcement, Not More\n\nArticle:\n\nThe shooting of Kate Steinle in San Francisco on July 1st has sparked a national conversation about immigration and crime. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant, was arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, while she was walking with her father on a busy pier. Lopez-Sanchez is reported to have been in the country without documentation and has a criminal history, including seven felony convictions.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the majority of immigrants in the United States, legal or otherwise. The Washington Post recently analyzed Donald Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants being drug dealers and \"rapists\" and found them to be incorrect. Being in the country without authorization is not a crime; it is a civil infraction.\n\nMost undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families. It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, grew from 1990 to 2010.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently announced it is rethinking its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals. This move is a step in the right direction, as it is time to start seriously targeting those immigrants who are a real threat to public safety. The government will be focusing its enforcement efforts on three categories of people: convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats.\n\nIt is important to remember that Lopez-Sanchez should not have been in the country, or he should at least have been behind bars. However, immigration authorities erred in not seeking a warrant or court order for his arrest, and he was released in accordance with city law in March. President Barack Obama's proposed executive action on immigration, currently tied up in a legal battle, might also have made a difference because it would have freed up resources to go after people like Lopez-Sanchez.\n\nThe executive action would have given deportation relief to parents of DREAMers, while allowing DHS to zero in on criminals. Instead, despite the fact that our country spends more on immigration enforcement than all other law enforcement agencies combined, our system failed Kate Steinle. Although Steinle's death was a tragedy, it was the alleged action of one man. All undocumented immigrants do not deserve to be vilified by false association.",
    " Title: New Hampshire Senate Debate Moderator Apologizes to Scott Brown for Geography Error\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent New Hampshire Senate debate, moderator James Pindell of WMUR apologized to Republican candidate Scott Brown for incorrectly disputing him on state geography. During the debate, Mr. Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, was asked about the economic conditions in Sullivan County, a county located on the western border of New Hampshire.\n\nMr. Brown responded by discussing the economic challenges faced by areas north of Concord, the state capital. He highlighted the presence of jobs, opportunities, and tourism, particularly in relation to ski areas and snowmobile trails.\n\nHowever, Mr. Pindell interrupted Mr. Brown, reminding him that the question was about Sullivan County, not the North Country. Mr. Brown clarified that he was referring to any area past Concord, and the challenges faced by the state as a whole.\n\nDespite Mr. Pindell's interruptions, Mr. Brown continued to discuss the economic challenges faced by northern counties. Later, Mr. Pindell admitted that Mr. Brown's geography was correct in a tweet, noting that Mr. Brown was referring to Mt. Sunapee, a ski resort in Sullivan County, which is north of Concord.\n\n\"I said that Sullivan County was west of Concord, not north of Concord. The truth is, it's both. So on this point, Scott Brown was right, I was wrong, and I apologize to Scott Brown and to both campaigns,\" Mr. Pindell said in his tweet.",
    " Title: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Indicted in Three Corruption Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted in three corruption cases, marking the first time a sitting head of state in Israel will face criminal charges. The indictment, announced Thursday, includes charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.\n\nThe indictment follows a four-day hearing last month with Netanyahu's defense team. The charges stem from three distinct cases:\n\n1. Case 4000: This case alleges that Netanyahu, during his tenure as communication minister, engaged in a quid pro quo deal with businessman and media mogul Shaul Elovich. The deal, as reported by Haaretz, involved Netanyahu spearheading regulations that helped Elovich gain roughly $500 million. In return, Netanyahu and his wife allegedly requested alterations to Walla News, which Elovich ran, to serve their political interests and undercut their opponents.\n\n2. Case 2000: This case accuses Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, of trying to limit the circulation of a rival paper in return for favorable media coverage.\n\n3. Case 1000: This case accuses Netanyahu of fraud and breach of trust for allegedly using his public role to receive gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and billionaire James Packer.\n\nIf convicted, Netanyahu could face up to 10 years in prison for bribery and a maximum of three years for fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, is not required to step down as a result of the charges. He can ask the parliament for immunity, though the establishment of a special committee to consider this request is currently delayed due to ongoing gridlock.\n\nThe indictment casts further uncertainty over Netanyahu's political future. Israel appears to be headed toward an unprecedented third election in less than a year after Netanyahu's chief rival announced Wednesday he would miss a deadline to form a ruling coalition.\n\nDuring the 21-day period following the announcement, the parliament can try to nominate any one of its 120 lawmakers to establish a coalition. Should that effort fail, an election would be triggered within 90 days.\n\nIf Netanyahu were to win a new election, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin would be forced to decide if he can give Netanyahu the mandate to form the next government given the criminal charges against him.",
    " Title: Republicans Push for Reduced Unemployment Benefits as Economy Shows Mixed Signs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe June jobs report, released this week, has sparked a renewed debate among political parties, with Republicans claiming victory following a reported growth of 4.8 million jobs and a decrease in the official unemployment rate to 11.1 percent. President Trump took to Twitter, proclaiming the numbers as \"HISTORIC JOBS NUMBERS!\"\n\nHowever, a closer look at the report reveals a more complex picture. Economist Jed Kolko, in his analysis, calculates a \"core\" unemployment rate, which includes permanent layoffs or quits, and the \"marginally attached\" people who express a desire to work but have not searched for a job in the past four weeks. This kind of unemployment has increased steadily since February and accelerated in June, rising from 5.0 percent to 5.9 percent.\n\nThe increase in jobs over the last month is primarily due to the reversal of temporary layoffs. While this is a positive development, the economy is still nearly 15 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels, and there is a growing problem of permanent unemployment as recessionary effects take hold and businesses shrink or close.\n\nMoreover, the June numbers are already outdated, as they are based on surveys conducted during the first two weeks of the month. The last two weeks have seen a surge in coronavirus cases across the country, and private economic activity indexes have shown a stalling out of spending. In states with high coronavirus case numbers, such as Texas and Florida, economic activity is going into reverse. Weekly unemployment claims have also plateaued over the last month or so, at levels many times higher than during the Great Recession.\n\nThe expiration of the $600 weekly unemployment supplement and the small business loan program, at least for the moment, has left millions of Americans without a crucial source of income. Economists and policymakers warn that without further government aid, the economic situation will worsen, and we may see a resurgence in unemployment and even bread riots.\n\nThe article argues that the U.S. government can borrow without limit as long as the economy has not recovered. Once the pandemic has passed, the focus can shift to restoring employment and production. The author suggests that universal checks could be increased to compensate for lower-income people taking jobs, addressing conservative complaints about labor incentives.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that Republicans' focus on shoving people into the labor market, regardless of the economic conditions, may harm President Trump's re-election prospects. The author argues that the U.S. government's primary duty should be to ensure the well-being of its citizens, and that this can be achieved through targeted economic aid during the pandemic.",
    " Title: California Senator Dianne Feinstein Introduces Comprehensive Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Senator Dianne Feinstein is set to introduce new gun control legislation today, aiming to reinstate the \"assault weapons\" ban of the Clinton era. However, the proposed legislation extends beyond the ban of firearms with a \"scary look\" to encompass a wide range of handguns, rifles, and shotguns.\n\nThe bill, to be introduced today, covers:\n1. Semiautomatic rifles, handguns, and shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one or more military characteristics.\n2. Semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe legislation aims to strengthen the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and various state bans by:\n1. Eliminating easy-to-remove bayonet mounts and flash suppressors from the characteristics test.\n2. Banning firearms with \u201cthumbhole stocks\u201d and \u201cbullet buttons\u201d to address attempts to \u201cwork around\u201d prior bans.\n\nThe bill also bans large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds. To protect legitimate hunters and the rights of existing gun owners, the legislation exempts over 900 specifically-named weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes.\n\nGrandfathered weapons must be registered under the National Firearms Act. This registration process includes certification from local law enforcement of the individual's identity and that possession would not violate State or local law. Fingerprinting for firearms that have been lawfully purchased is part of the proposed legislation.\n\nThe bill covers a wide range of firearms, with nearly every semi-automatic handgun in the United States having a detachable magazine. The term \"assault weapon\" is a political term not specific to any weapon, and it is typically used in reference to semi-automatic rifles. However, any weapon can be used to assault someone.\n\nThe legislation's provision for protecting legitimate hunters and existing gun owners has raised questions about who qualifies as a legitimate hunter, particularly considering many people may not hunt annually but only occasionally. The hunting argument is often used by pro-gun control advocates as a compromise on the issue, but the Second Amendment has no connection to hunting.\n\nThe success of Feinstein's legislation is uncertain, as it reflects extreme stances on the Second Amendment that many Democrats have already criticized as out of touch, wrong-headed, and an ineffective method of preventing school shootings.\n\nIn a related development, according to CNN, Feinstein has received permission from DC police to be flanked with semi-automatic rifles during a press conference today at 11 a.m. when the legislation will be officially introduced.",
    " Title: Clinton and Sanders Accused of Debate Date Dispute Ahead of Wisconsin Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nThe campaigns of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been engaged in a dispute over debate dates ahead of the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday. Clinton, who is the current Democratic front-runner, and Sanders, who has won five of the last six primaries or caucuses, have been readying their final appeals to Wisconsin voters.\n\nClinton, in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" expressed her readiness for a debate with Sanders in New York, her adopted home state, ahead of its April 19 primary. Sanders, a Brooklynite, has challenged Clinton to a debate in delegate-rich New York.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has offered a few dates, including a weekday morning and at the same time as Monday night's NCAA men's basketball championship, which the Sanders campaign and others view as less than optimal for viewership. Clinton, however, expressed confidence about the debate happening.\n\nOn Sunday, the Sanders campaign countered by stating that the candidate is available to debate on April 10, 11, 12, or 13. Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs also accused the Clinton campaign of being disingenuous, stating they announced a debate date when they knew Sanders already had park permits for a major rally in New York City.\n\nBriggs said in a statement late Sunday that Sanders accepted an invitation for a prime-time debate on April 10 on NBC News. \"Let's stop the silly political games,\" Briggs said. \"Let's get on with debating the candidates' stands on serious issues affecting New York and the United States.\"\n\nClinton had no public events Sunday in Wisconsin, where some polls show Sanders with a slight lead. Clinton, however, made clear that Sanders remains a political threat. \"I certainly have not moved on,\" she told NBC. \"I know that I still have work to do to win the nomination.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the top two Republican presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, were campaigning in Wisconsin. Trump, the Republican front-runner, doubled-down on his comments about the US should \"do a better deal\" with Japan, South Korea, and other allies, suggesting they should pay more for America's protection while taking a greater role in their defense, including building their own nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump also discussed his plans to change the nation's tax code by \"simplifying\" it. \"The very rich are probably going to end up paying more,\" he said, \"but there's an incentive for them to invest and create jobs in the country.\"\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich, the other Republican candidate, told ABC's \"This Week\" that the Republican convention, which could happen in July without a clear nominee based on delegate wins, could be a civics lesson for the country. \"Kids will spend less time focusing on Bieber and Kardashian and more time focusing on how we elect presidents,\" said Kasich, who has won only Ohio. \"It will be so cool.\"\n\nTrump called for Kasich to drop out of the race, arguing he should not be allowed to continue accumulating delegates if he has no chance of being the nominee. Trump has 736 pledged delegates, followed by Cruz with 463, then Kasich with 143\u2014with 1,237 needed to secure the nomination. Trump, however, after a difficult week, now trails Cruz in Wisconsin, after some polls showed him leading by double-digits several weeks ago. Trump said Sunday that Kasich could be considered as a nominee at the GOP convention in July even without competing in the remaining nominating contests.",
    " Title: Military Deployment to Puerto Rico: Pace of Relief Efforts Accelerates Amidst Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe deployment of military personnel to Puerto Rico, following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has been criticized for its slow pace, with approximately 5,000 National Guard forces and active military members currently assisting a population of 3.5 million. This number is significantly lower compared to the 22,000 troops deployed to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.\n\nIn the first six days after the hurricane made landfall, the Navy had deployed only two ships due to concerns about the damage to Puerto Rico's ports. However, harrowing reports of U.S. citizens struggling without electricity, food, and water have prompted the Pentagon to escalate the relief effort, despite not receiving specific requests from territorial officials.\n\nThe issue of port congestion has been raised as a reason for the slow response and the reluctance to waive the Jones Act. However, it appears that a lack of preparedness may also be a factor. For instance, the hospital ship USNS Comfort, which was announced to be on its way to Puerto Rico, is still not en route, despite being ready to deploy as soon as the call comes.\n\nThe Comfort, a mammoth ship, was docked Tuesday in its home port of Norfolk, Virginia, with a minimal crew, requiring up to five days to stock up and prepare. When reached by phone Tuesday afternoon, the commanding officer of the ship's hospital, Capt. Kevin D. Buckley, said, \"The Comfort is ready to go, if the call comes.\"\n\nThe order to move the Comfort finally came a week after the storm, but the ship is still not en route, a delay that could have been avoided if preparations had been made a week before Maria hit Puerto Rico, as soon as the power and course of the storm became clear. In comparison, during the Haiti disaster, the Comfort was ordered on its way immediately following the earthquake.\n\nWhile the White House has allowed foreign-built or flagged ships to deliver supplies during the emergency, it has restricted members of Congress from making official visits as part of official delegations to the hurricane-battered U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Congressional sources from both parties said Wednesday that the Trump administration is restricting these visits. The office of Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who had been organizing a visit to Puerto Rico by several representatives and senators from both parties, is now trying to find alternatives to assess the federal response thus far.\n\nThe San Juan Airport is open, though the speed of flights going in and out is severely restricted by the damaged infrastructure. The restriction on Congressional flights has some validity, though it has the notable side effect of preventing any Congressional oversight or evaluation of conditions on the ground.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Discusses High Expectations for Women in Public Eye\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview that aired on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Friday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed that high-achieving women in the public eye are often expected to perform at a higher level.\n\nDuring the interview, Clinton stated, \"I think Mika and I understand this, and maybe it's because still today, when you are a high-achieving woman\u2014particularly one in the public eye\u2014you really are just expected to perform at a higher level all the time.\"\n\nClinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner, was referring to her co-host, Mika Brzezinski, who was doing more preparation for the interview. Host Joe Scarborough had previously commented on Brzezinski's extensive preparation.\n\nClinton continued, \"And there are not enough experiences with different styles or different approaches that women make. Men, my goodness\u2014you know, there's a million different ways you could be successful, you could communicate and all the rest of it. And look, I'm not telling you anything you don't know.\"\n\nWhen asked by Scarborough if she ever looked at how her husband, former President Bill Clinton, did things and thought \"it's not fair,\" Clinton responded, \"I am not a natural politician like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama.\" She explained, \"So for me, it really came through the root of service; it really came from my deep conviction that we had to make sure that this country we all love kept producing opportunities for everybody, and I see that narrowing, and I see people being left out, and it upsets me.\"\n\nClinton further elaborated, \"And so I invest a lot of energy and a lot of my own emotion into what I do and I think sometimes, instead of that being as easy to understand as I would like it to be, it sometimes is a little nerve-wracking.\"",
    " Title: America's Progress and Comparative Analysis of Racism and Bigotry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the GLAAD Media Awards, pop icon Britney Spears expressed her thoughts on societal norms and individuality. The speech, while sincere and heartfelt, sparked a reflection on the perception of America's societal issues, particularly racism and bigotry.\n\nThe article discusses the observation made by political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset that those who only know one country cannot truly understand its norms and exceptionalities. This perspective is applied to the United States, where discussions about deep-seated racism and bigotry are prevalent.\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that discrimination exists in the United States, the article argues that it is a mischaracterization to claim that America is the most racist or bigoted country in the world. The author cites statistics from a 2014 study that ranked the United States 47th in opposition to having a racially different neighbor, with only 6% of the population expressing opposition.\n\nThe article also highlights the increasing trend of interracial marriages in the United States, with the rate rising from 3% in 1967 to 17% in 2015. This trend suggests a significant shift in societal attitudes towards race, the author argues.\n\nThe article also touches upon the progress made in terms of attitudes towards homosexuality, citing the similar trend in attitudes as race and the election of racial minorities as heads of state in the United States.\n\nThe author concludes by questioning the assertion that America is uniquely hostile to \"being different,\" suggesting that such a claim may have had some basis in fact in the past, but may be less accurate in the present day. The article emphasizes that while the United States is not without its problems, it is essential to recognize and acknowledge the progress that has been made.",
    " Title: Senate to Hold Briefing on Election Security Amidst Ongoing Opposition to Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate will hold a private briefing on election security on Wednesday, a move that Democrats have advocated for over several months. The briefing, which is expected to include officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, is taking place amidst Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's ongoing opposition to the consideration of election security legislation.\n\nWhile both parties have expressed concerns about potential foreign interference in the 2020 elections, Republican lawmakers have generally been more reluctant to take up concrete measures. This reluctance is partly due to McConnell's strong opposition, as he views these laws as potentially giving the federal government too much control over state and local elections, and as a means to benefit the Democrats.\n\nDespite repeated warnings from high-level government officials, the Republican-controlled Senate has allowed several bills addressing election security to fall by the wayside. Bills such as the Protecting American Votes and Elections Act, the Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act, and the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections Act have not been passed. As a result, the US Senate, which allocated $380 million in election security funds last year, is now effectively promoting a do-nothing approach to a subject that special counsel Robert Mueller and numerous national security officials have raised as a serious threat requiring additional action.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the information shared during the briefing will be enough to spur further action. The actions of the Republican-controlled Senate up until this point suggest they might not. McConnell's unwillingness to tackle election security is not just sending a political message, it could have major consequences. Democrats are hoping an in-depth briefing about the risks the US faces might push Republicans to change course.",
    " Title: Trump Sets Conditions for U.S. Participation in Iran Nuclear Agreement, Gives Congress 60 Days to Address Flaws\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and called for stricter conditions regarding Iranian behavior in order to maintain U.S. participation in the pact. In a speech on Friday, Trump stated that the agreement is under review and could be terminated if a solution cannot be reached with Congress and allies.\n\nThe president's speech outlined the growing threat from Iran, including its sponsorship of terrorism, missile program, and efforts to destabilize the Middle East. Trump's ultimatum was the most significant part of his speech, as he announced that he will terminate the agreement unless its flaws are addressed.\n\nCongress now has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose severe economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted by the nuclear agreement. Congress will also consider legislation addressing the agreement's shortcomings and \"triggers\" imposing sanctions in response to Iranian behavior.\n\nThe nuclear agreement's three major flaws, as identified by the president, include allowing Iran to enrich uranium, operate a plutonium-producing heavy-water reactor, and the deal's weak inspection provisions. Other issues, such as Iran's missile program, support of terrorism, and meddling in regional conflicts, should also be addressed.\n\nWhile there has been some discussion of extending the deal's \"sunset\" clause, such a fix would be meaningless without addressing the above changes concerning Iran's nuclear program. However, it is unlikely that these vital changes will be approved by Congress in legislation or agreed to by other nations who signed the Iran deal.\n\nCongress is unlikely to pass legislation with any substantial fixes to the agreement due to the need for 60 votes in the Senate, making it difficult to garner enough support from moderate Republican senators and Democratic votes. European states also plan to resist any efforts by U.S. officials to fix the nuclear deal, according to a senior European Union official.\n\nPresident Trump can reimpose most sanctions on Iran himself if Congress fails to act, and he could take such action as part of a withdrawal decision. The president's decision to give Congress and European leaders a final chance to fix the agreement before terminating it is a departure from President Obama's approach, which did not submit the pact to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.",
    " Title: HHS Reverses Obama-Era Policy, Defines \"Sex\" as Biological for Obamacare Nondiscrimination Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced a new rule that defines \"sex\" as biological for the purposes of the Affordable Care Act's (Obamacare) nondiscrimination policy. This rule reverses a regulation implemented during the Obama administration that redefined \"sex\" to include \"gender identity\" and \"termination of pregnancy.\"\n\nSection 1557 of Obamacare prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability in health-related programs or activities. In late 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas enjoined Section 1557's prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and termination of pregnancy. Last fall, the same federal judge vacated the regulation, stating that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nAs a result of these rulings, HHS could no longer enforce the Obama-era provision, and today's new rule brings federal policy into compliance with court rulings. Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, stated, \"What this regulatory reform does is update the books to reflect the reality that 'gender identity' and 'termination of pregnancy' have been deemed unlawful interpretations of civil-rights law. This final rule is merely conforming to that legal reality.\"\n\nThe new HHS rule also maintains the Obama administration's decision not to include \"sexual orientation\" as a protected category under the definition of sex discrimination. Some progressive advocates had urged the Obama-era HHS to add \"sexual orientation\" to its regulation, but it failed to do so.\n\nOpponents of the Obama administration's regulation had both health-care and religious-freedom concerns about its implications. Because the policy applied to any health programs or activities funded or administered by HHS, as well as any plans offered in Obamacare's health-insurance marketplaces, it affected a large number of health-care providers in the U.S.\n\nBy redefining \"sex,\" the policy required medical professionals to treat biological males who identify as women, and biological women who identify as men, according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex\u2014a practice that can lead to improper health-care decisions. There was, for instance, a documented case in which a biological female who identified as a male visited a hospital complaining of abdominal pain. Because the doctors were required to treat this person according to gender identity, this biological woman, who was unknowingly pregnant, ended up delivering a stillborn child.\n\n\"We agree with the court's rationale that the plain original meaning of'sex' under our sex-discrimination laws referred to the biological realities of sex, and this is particularly important for programs administered or funded by HHS, because we so often deal with the scientific reality of sex in our health and research programs,\" Severino explained.\n\nThe Obama policy also had negative implications for religious-liberty and conscience rights, particularly for health-care workers. \"There were religious-freedom concerns at play, as well as to the ability of doctors to be able to act according to their best medical judgment, as well as their conscience and religious beliefs,\" Severino said.\n\nThe decision to reverse the Obama-administration regulation will likely be met with fury by progressive activists and their allies in the media. When it first became public that the Trump administration was considering undoing the Section 1557 rule, the New York Times falsely asserted that \"Transgender\" Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration. Nevertheless, the move fulfills a key promise that President Trump made both on the campaign trail and throughout his time in office, voicing support for undoing Obama-era policies that redefined \"sex\" to include \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity.\" This move, though it comes near the end of his first term, is another step in showing his supporters, especially social conservatives, that he is willing to follow through.",
    " Title: Clinton's National Lead Over Trump Expands Amidst Email Scandal; James Carville Discusses 2016 Election Outlook\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton has maintained an average lead of over 5 percent against Donald Trump in national polls. This lead is even more substantial in traditional battleground states, where Clinton currently holds a double-digit advantage over her Republican rival. However, the latest chapter in Clinton's email scandal, involving the discovery of 15,000 previously undisclosed emails and documents, has prompted renewed criticism.\n\nThe new wave of scrutiny has led to fresh accusations that Clinton may have given preferential treatment to major Clinton Foundation donors and fostered a \"pay to play\" culture during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nPrior to the latest scandal, James Carville, a longtime Clinton confidant and political strategist who guided Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, spoke to * \u2588\u2588\u2588's Hive about Clinton's chances in the 2016 presidential election and the state of the Republican Party.\n\nWhen asked about the election's outcome, Carville expressed a belief that the Democrats were likely to secure a significant victory. He attributed this to the substantial and rapidly changing demographics in the country, which are unfavorable to the Republican Party, and the party's continued focus on non-college whites, a demographic that has not been successful in presidential years.\n\nBeyond the changing demographics, Carville pointed to the legacy of the last Republican presidency and the disastrous war and recession that marked that period. He suggested that these factors, combined with the Republican Party's primary appeal to non-college whites, were contributing to the party's struggles in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nRegarding Trump's hard-core supporters, Carville noted that they are not the same people who voted for candidates like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, or Jeb Bush. He attributed Trump's success to his alignment with a version of an ethnocentric, nationalistic party that differs significantly from traditional Republican views. Carville also suggested that as Republicans perceive their party shrinking, they have hardened in their views, which is damaging to their immediate-term prospects.\n\nCarville further commented on the concerns within the Republican Party, stating, \"Republicans are not so much worried about losing the election as they are about losing an entire generation.\" He suggested that many Republicans feel their influence is shrinking, and Trump's campaign appeals to those who feel their lives have not turned out as they expected or hoped. Trump's message resonates with those who feel the country is not the same as it was when they were growing up.",
    " Title: President Obama Highlights American Resilience, Calls for Vote on Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of recent natural disasters, former President Barack Obama emphasized the American spirit of unity and resilience, stating that Americans come together during trying times. He highlighted the country's progress in overcoming economic recession and war, and expressed optimism about the current economic recovery.\n\nObama pointed out that the middle class thrives when everyone receives a fair opportunity, contributes their fair share, and adheres to the same rules. He declared his intention to be an advocate for the aspirations of all Americans and encouraged citizens to vote on Tuesday.\n\nThe former president underscored the significant progress made during his administration, including the end of the Iraq war, the death of Osama bin Laden, the creation of nearly 5.5 million jobs in the last two and a half years, and the resurgence of the American auto industry. He acknowledged that the country still has work to do but emphasized the real progress that has been made.\n\nObama contrasted the two presidential candidates' visions for the country, stating that the path offered by his opponent, Mitt Romney, is a return to the policies that led to the economic crisis. He criticized Romney's proposed tax cuts for the wealthy, encouragement of job outsourcing, and deregulation of big banks and insurance companies.\n\nThe former president emphasized the need for education, job training, and investment in technology to create good jobs and stimulate economic growth. He highlighted his administration's efforts to make college more affordable, recruit math and science teachers, and train community college students for in-demand jobs.\n\nObama also emphasized the need for domestic investment in manufacturing, innovation, and infrastructure, as well as a shift in energy policy to prioritize clean energy and reduce oil imports. He also called for a reduction in military spending, using the savings to pay down the national debt and rebuild America's infrastructure.\n\nThe former president also addressed the need to reduce the deficit through spending cuts and tax reform, but opposed cuts to social welfare programs and the privatization of Medicare. He emphasized the need to support the American people, particularly those who are struggling, and to create opportunities for all, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nObama concluded by emphasizing the need to finish the work that has been started, to educate and train the workforce, create jobs, and provide opportunities for all Americans. He expressed optimism for the future and called on Americans to vote on Tuesday.",
    " Title: Florida High School Shooting Survivors Lobby for Assault-Style Rifle Ban in Tallahassee\n\nArticle:\n\nDozens of students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of a shooting rampage that left 17 dead last week, traveled to Tallahassee on Tuesday to advocate for a ban on assault-style rifles. The massacre, the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in U.S. history, has sparked a national debate about gun rights and stricter firearms controls.\n\nStudents from the South Florida high school were emotional as they stepped off buses in Tallahassee, greeted with waves, cheers, and somber applause from fellow teens. Diego Pfeiffer, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, told the crowd, \"We're here to make sure this never happens again.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, less than a week after the shooting, the Republican-controlled Florida House of Representatives rejected a bill to block sales of assault-style rifles in the state. Tyra Hemans, a 19-year-old senior who traveled to the state capital, said, \"I am not going back to school until lawmakers, and the president, change this law.\"\n\nStudent and parent activists from the high school in Parkland, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale, were expected to stage a rally on Wednesday at the statehouse. Fourteen students and three educators were killed, and 15 other people were wounded in the Feb. 14 attack. Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former student expelled from Stoneman Douglas High for disciplinary problems, was arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\n\nAuthorities say Cruz was armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault-style rifle that he legally purchased from a licensed gun dealer last year, when he was 18. Former classmates have described Cruz as a social outcast and trouble-maker with a fascination for guns, and police have acknowledged responding to numerous calls related to Cruz during the past few years.\n\nOn Tuesday, a member of the accused gunman's legal team from the Broward County public defender's office said Cruz saw his life unravel last year, when he was expelled and his mother died. In 2017, Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened an inquiry into Cruz after he was reported to have been cutting himself, but the case was closed in November of that year with the finding that he was receiving sufficient support, the agency said.\n\nThe youth-led protest movement that erupted within hours of the shooting attracted prominent celebrity supporters on Tuesday when film star George Clooney and his wife Amal, a human rights lawyer, said they would donate $500,000 to help fund a planned March 24 gun control march in Washington. Hollywood director Steven Spielberg and media mogul Oprah Winfrey later joined in contributing $500,000 each toward the march.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News opinion poll released on Tuesday showed 77 percent of Americans believe the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress is doing too little to prevent mass shootings, with 62 percent saying President Donald Trump, also a Republican, has not done enough on that front. Trump said on Tuesday he had signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to draw up regulations banning devices that turn firearms into machine guns, like the bump stock used in October's mass shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nStudents and parents elsewhere in Florida and in other states, including Tennessee and Minnesota, staged sympathy protests on Tuesday, according to local media reports. Gun violence on public school and college campuses has become so commonplace in the United States during the past several years that education officials regularly stage drills to train students and staff about what they should do in the event of a mass shooting on school grounds.\n\nGun ownership is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and remains one of the nation's more divisive issues. A federal ban on assault weapons, in force for 10 years, expired in 2004. Funerals continued for the young victims of Wednesday's attack. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point on Tuesday said it made a rare posthumous letter of acceptance to Peter Wang, a student of the school killed in the shooting. A Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet, Wang had aspired to attend the elite academy.",
    " Title: Five Tax Breaks Under Threat in Upcoming Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final 15 days before the Senate's deadline to reevaluate the entire Tax Code, two key senators, Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), are employing a \"blank slate\" approach. This strategy involves eliminating most special tax provisions, shifting the burden to colleagues to justify their inclusion. By July 26, senators must explain why each provision should remain.\n\nOne of the most significant tax breaks under scrutiny is the mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners to deduct up to $1 million in mortgage interest annually, including for vacation homes. This deduction, often considered the \"motherhood and apple pie\" of tax breaks, is projected to cost over $1 trillion over 10 years, making it one of the biggest tax expenditures.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the deduction will be completely abolished, it may undergo significant changes if tax reform progresses. Critics argue that the government should not subsidize the wealthy who can afford to spend $1 million on a home. Options to reduce the value of the deduction while maintaining it for middle-class homeowners include capping all deductions at 28%, as proposed by President Barack Obama, or focusing the write-off more on lower-income individuals by capping it at $500,000 and replacing the deduction with a credit. This change could save $213 billion, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nLobbyists, such as the National Association of Realtors, are expected to remind lawmakers of the ongoing housing market recovery and argue that curbing the break could negatively impact housing prices, particularly in vacation communities.\n\nAnother tax break under threat is the carried interest tax rate, which applies to hedge fund managers, private equity executives, and others working on Wall Street. Instead of paying ordinary income taxes, which top out at nearly 40%, carried interest is taxed as a capital gain, generally at a rate of 20%. Top earners started paying an additional 3.8% tax on their investment income this year. This break costs about $17 billion over 10 years.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that the break is unfair, as Wall Street executives' pay is taxed as capital gains rather than ordinary income. If lawmakers decide it is not worth spending time on the issue during tax reform, they may finally address this complaint. Lobbyists, such as the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, are expected to argue that higher taxes on carried interest would negatively impact the economy.",
    " Title: FBI Fails to Act on Tip Regarding Florida School Shooter Nikolas Cruz\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) admitted on Friday that it had received a tip more than a month before the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting on Wednesday, in which 17 people were killed. The tip, made on January 5, 2018, described Nikolas Cruz's gun ownership, his desire to kill people, erratic behavior, disturbing social media posts, and potential school shooting plans.\n\nAccording to the FBI, the tip should have been forwarded to the Miami field office for investigation, but that did not occur. The Miami field office did not receive the tip, and no further investigation was conducted at the time. The FBI stated, \"Protocols were not followed.\"\n\nThe FBI's failure to act on this tip is likely to generate scrutiny on how law enforcement handles its investigations in such cases. FBI Director Christopher Wray stated, \"We are still investigating the facts. I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing the processes for responding to information that we receive from the public.\"\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott called for Wray's resignation, stating, \"We constantly promote'see something, say something,' and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act.\" Scott emphasized, \"See something, say something' is an incredibly important tool, and people must have confidence in the follow-through from law enforcement.\"\n\nIn addition to the call to the FBI tip line, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel stated at a press conference on Friday that his department had received about 20 calls regarding Cruz in the past few years. He did not provide details about the calls but stated he would investigate each one to ensure it was handled appropriately.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a tweet on February 15, 2018, appeared to blame \"neighbors and classmates\" for not reporting Cruz to authorities. The FBI's statement is the latest piece of evidence that many people not only saw red flags in Cruz's behavior but tried to report them, and those warnings were not thoroughly pursued or fell on deaf ears.\n\nThis failure of the FBI to act on the tip comes after questions over a YouTube comment posted last fall by someone named \"nikolas cruz\" that read, \"Im going to be a professional school shooter.\" A man in Mississippi saw the comment on his YouTube channel and flagged it to both YouTube, which removed it, and the authorities. The FBI has stated that they were unable to identify the commenter despite conducting database reviews and checks.",
    " Title: Uninsured Rate Among Low- and Middle-Income LGBT Americans Decreases by a Quarter Since Affordable Care Act Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a report from the Center for American Progress, the uninsured rate among low- and middle-income LGBT Americans has decreased by a quarter since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The report, which relies on surveys of LGBT Americans earning less than 400 percent of the poverty line, shows that the uninsured rate fell from 34 percent in 2013 to 26 percent in 2014.\n\nThe decline in the uninsured rate among LGBT individuals has been slightly faster than the drop among the general population, where the uninsured rate fell by about a quarter. The gains were particularly large among lower-income groups, which were eligible for bigger insurance subsidies or the Medicaid expansion. The uninsured rate for LGBT individuals earning between 139 and 200 percent of the poverty line fell by 18 percentage points.\n\nThe report indicates that 26 percent of LGBT Americans under 400 percent of the poverty line are uninsured, while the number is 20 percent among the general population. LGBT people can face unique obstacles in gaining coverage, as there is no federal law requiring all companies to offer health benefits to their employees' same-sex partners. The report also suggests that some individuals could miss out on coverage due to anti-LGBT bias in hiring, which may push many LGBT people into unemployment or low-wage jobs that do not offer benefits such as health insurance coverage.\n\nOnly 38 percent of LGBT people under 400 percent of the poverty line have an offer of insurance through either their own or their spouse's employer, while the number stands at 58 percent among the general population. The report also highlights disparities in coverage rates within the LGBT community, with gay and bisexual individuals having higher insured rates than lesbian women, and the uninsured rate among transgender populations being especially high. The report suggests that the uninsured rate among transgender populations has come down significantly under the Affordable Care Act, although the 2013 survey only included a smaller number of transgender individuals.\n\nA correction has been made to an initial version of this story, which misstated the size of the decline of the uninsured rate for LGBT people. It is 24 percent, not 25 percent.",
    " Title: Historic Flooding in Texas Expected to Worsen as Hurricane Harvey Brings Record Rainfall\n\nArticle:\n\nCatastrophic flooding in the U.S. state of Texas is expected to worsen in the coming days as waters continue to rise following Hurricane Harvey, a storm of historic proportions. The city of Houston has already received a record 30 inches (75cm) of rain, turning roads into rivers. Forecasters predict the total rainfall could nearly double later this week.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has promised swift action to help those affected and is due to visit Texas on Tuesday. He stated, \"Recovery will be a long and difficult road, and the federal government stands ready, willing, and able to support that effort.\" He added that he was dealing with Congress on funding, warning, \"It's going to be a very expensive situation.\"\n\nHarvey made landfall as a category-four hurricane late on Friday, bringing unprecedented flooding. It was later downgraded to a tropical storm. More than 3,000 people have been rescued in and around Houston, where about 6.6 million people live in the metropolitan area. Helicopters have plucked victims from rooftops.\n\nAt least nine people are reported to have died in incidents related to the storm, according to Texan officials. Six members of the same family died trying to flee rising floodwaters, relatives told U.S. media, but the incident has not been confirmed.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott has activated the entire Texas National Guard - some 12,000 \"civilian soldiers\" - to assist national forces in search and rescue operations. The area is expected to have received a year's rainfall within a week.\n\nOfficials expect half a million disaster victims to seek assistance in Texas and 30,000 people to be housed in emergency shelters. The National Hurricane Center expects \"catastrophic and life-threatening flooding\" to continue across south-eastern Texas, with additional rainfall accumulations of 15 to 25 inches expected.\n\nArmy engineers have begun releasing water from two dams controlling water flowing along a major river into the heart of Houston. Officials said they were opening the Addicks and Barker dams to stop water spilling into neighboring communities, but that this could cause further damage down the Buffalo Bayou.\n\nMany schools are closed, as are Houston's two main airports, with runways completely flooded. The Texas Gulf Coast is a key center of the U.S. oil and gas industry, and some of the largest refineries in the country have halted operations.\n\nIn the suburbs to the west of Houston, hundreds of families waded cautiously along a road they usually take to the shops, to school, and to work. It was an exhausting journey of well over a mile in waist-high flooding. All night, as water lapped into their homes, people had been calling for help, they said, but no-one came. Eventually, a lone police officer arrived, but by then, people had taken matters into their own hands, forming a makeshift armada of little boats, jet skis, blow-up mattresses, and even rubber rings.\n\nSimilar levels of 15-25 inches of rain are predicted for south-western and central Louisiana. The state suffered huge destruction following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Observers have drawn comparisons with the disastrous evacuation of homes in New Orleans ahead of Katrina, which left thousands of people stranded in squalid conditions at that city's stadium.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been ordered to leave parts of Fort Bend County, about 35 miles south-west of Houston, where a river is set to crest this week. Dallas, 240 miles north of Houston, will set up a \"mega shelter\" at its convention center to house 5,000 evacuees, city officials said. However, Houston authorities have not issued a mass evacuation order.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner on Sunday defended the decision by citing the \"crazy\" logistics of planning an evacuation of 2.3 million people. Meanwhile, Police Chief Art Acevedo said officers were focused on protecting the city from looters, with four people arrested on Monday.\n\nFor further information or to speak to a BBC journalist, please contact the provided contact number or use the given methods.",

In an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Warren stated, \"I'm not running for president.\"\n\nWhen asked about calls for genetic testing to resolve the heritage controversy, Warren shared a family history as told by her parents and grandparents. She said, \"It's a part of who I am, and no one's ever going to take that away.\"\n\nSenator Warren, who is seeking a second Senate term this year, has been accused of claiming Native American heritage to secure jobs, including a position as a Harvard law professor. She has acknowledged identifying as a minority but denies using such status to advance her career.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly referred to Warren, a Wall Street critic and potential White House rival, as \"Pocahontas,\" a notable American Indian woman in colonial history, to highlight the controversy.\n\nIn the interview, Warren shared details about her family, stating, \"My mom and dad were born and raised out in Oklahoma, and my daddy was in his teens when he fell in love with my mother. She was a beautiful girl who played the piano. And he was head over heels in love with her and wanted to marry her. And his family was bitterly opposed to that because she was part Native American.\"\n\nWarren went on to describe the hardships her parents faced during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, and how they raised three boys, all of whom went off to the military. She concluded by saying, \"They raised me. They knocked around, and it was tough, but they hung together. They hung together for 63 years.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Justices Align on Prisoner's Supervised Release Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh formed a majority on Monday, ruling that a criminal defendant can be sentenced for violating their supervised release, even if the release expires while they are incarcerated awaiting new charges. Ginsburg's vote was swapped with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan in their dissent.\n\nThe case in question involves Jason Mont, who was indicted by a grand jury for multiple drug and firearm offenses. Mont was released from federal prison on March 6, 2012, but was found guilty of two counts of cocaine trafficking while on supervised release, and tested positive on several drug tests. His supervised release date was set for June 28, 2017.\n\nThe District Court issued a warrant on March 30, 2017, and ultimately set a supervised-release hearing for June 28, 2017. Two days before that hearing, Mont challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court, based on the fact that his supervised release had initially been set to expire on March 6, 2017. The court concluded that it had authority to supervise Mont, revoked his supervised release, and ordered him to serve an additional 42 months' imprisonment to run consecutive to his state sentence.\n\nIn his opinion, Justice Ginsburg wrote, \"Under our view, in contrast, time in pretrial detention constitutes supervised release only if the charges against the defendant are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted. This ensures that the defendant is not faulted for conduct he might not have committed, while otherwise giving full effect to the lawful judgment previously imposed on the defendant.\"\n\nThis unexpected alliance between Ginsburg and Thomas comes a week after a tense argument between the two justices over the case Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc. The Court decided against taking up the question of the Sex Selective and Disability Abortion Ban, which, as Justice Thomas described it, bans abortions in which \"the mother is seeking the abortion solely because of the child's race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, disability, or related characteristics.\"\n\nIn a 20-page opinion, Thomas wrote about how the abortion rights movement was starting to look a lot like eugenics. \"This case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation,\" he wrote. \"Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was particularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes.\"\n\nA frustrated Ginsburg said that Thomas's diatribe \"displays more heat than light.\" She reasoned that, \"A woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a'mother.'\"\n\nToday, the justices managed to find an issue on which they have common ground.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Bill Includes Industry-Specific Provisions for Meat, Ski, and Cruise Industries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 844-page bipartisan immigration bill, various senators have included provisions that cater to specific industries in their respective states. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has advocated for more visas for the meat industry, a significant employer in his state. New York Democrat Sen. Charles Schumer has pushed for special treatment for Irish workers, given the large Irish population in his state. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio has sought assistance for the cruise-ship industry, a major business in his home state. Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet has included a boost for ski areas.\n\nThe new work-visa program, allowing up to 200,000 low-skill workers, was not part of the initial deal. However, additional visas for meat, poultry, and fish cutters were added due to the efforts of Sen. Graham, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The final bill sets aside up to 20,000 additional visas for meat cutters and trimmers.\n\nIn South Carolina, broilers (chickens raised for meat) are the primary commodity, generating nearly 27% of all agricultural cash in the state in 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union is not in favor of the visas for foreign workers, stating there is no labor shortage in the industry.\n\nSen. Bennet, working with an association representing most of Colorado's ski resorts, crafted a provision to make it easier for them to hire foreign ski instructors. Instead of using a visa program for temporary, low-skilled workers, ski instructors would be eligible to come to the U.S. under the same program that professional athletes use.\n\nFor Sen. Schumer, the immigration bill provided an opportunity to include an extra 10,500 visas for Irish people with at least a high-school degree. An aide to Sen. Schumer stated the provision aims to rectify a 1965 change to immigration law that allegedly made it difficult for Irish immigrants to obtain visas, despite their strong cultural ties to the U.S.\n\nSen. Rubio, from hurricane-prone Florida, inserted an opportunity for foreigners to work on relief operations after state or federal disasters for 90 days. He also included a provision allowing certain foreigners to repair cruise ships made abroad, as well as other transportation equipment. Florida drew $6.7 billion in direct spending from the cruise industry in 2011, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.\n\nThe construction industry has been critical of immigration-bill provisions, but it fared better than expected. Sen. Rubio and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) were not able to get a cap lifted that limits construction visas to 15,000, but they did include a provision allowing foreigners to work in higher-skilled jobs such as electricians, plumbers, and welders.\n\nDespite the victory, various construction groups stated in interviews they would fight the overall cap on construction jobs. \"Obviously, this is just the first step of a long road,\" said Marco Giamberardino, executive director of government affairs at the National Electrical Contractors Association.",
    " Title: Martin Family Calls for President Obama to Investigate Trayvon Martin's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a television interview on Thursday, Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, and his father, Tracy Martin, called on President Barack Obama to thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the shooting death of their son. The request was made during an appearance on CBS This Morning.\n\nWhen asked what they wanted the president to do, Sybrina Fulton responded, \"That's pretty tough. To say the least, at least investigate what happened. At least go through it with a fine-tooth comb and just make sure all the T's were crossed and all the I's were dotted, because this is sending a terrible message.\"\n\nFulton expressed concern about the impact the verdict might have on American teenagers, stating, \"It's sending out a terrible message to young teenagers. Trayvon was walking too slow, so should they be walking too fast? You know, so I don't think teenagers in whole know exactly what to do now.\"\n\nThis was the first time Martin's parents had given television interviews since the verdict was announced. Following the verdict, a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin. President Obama released a statement urging calm but has not spoken publicly about the verdict.\n\nThe Department of Justice is considering whether to bring a civil rights case against Zimmerman, but the White House has stated that Obama will not be involved in the decision-making process. Martin's family attorney, Benjamin Crump, stated that they were examining legal options for a potential civil suit and were seeking the Justice Department's input.\n\nTracy Martin spoke on NBC's Today show on Thursday, stating, \"Obviously, any time you have a person that makes an assumption that a person is up to no good, there's some type of profiling there. Was he racially profiled? I think that if Trayvon had been white, this wouldn't have ever happened. So obviously race played some type of role.\"\n\nThe family also urged protesters to remain peaceful and not to damage property or get arrested. Sybrina Fulton stated on NBC, \"We have always maintained to do things decent and in order, and we think the protests should be peaceful protests. We're not saying for them not to protest, because they have a right to protest, they have a right to be heard. But we just want to make sure that it is peaceful, that nobody gets hurt, that nobody gets arrested, that you don't damage your own property.\"\n\nMartin's parents also discussed the emotional impact the case has had on them. Tracy Martin stated, \"I was in a bit of shock. I thought surely that he would be found guilty of second-degree murder, manslaughter at the least, but I just knew that they would see that this was a teenager just trying to get home.\"\n\nSybrina Fulton responded to one of the jurors who spoke anonymously with CNN and placed some of the blame for Trayvon's death on him. Fulton stated, \"I don't think she knows Trayvon. Trayvon is not a confrontational person. So instead of placing the blame on the teenager, we need to place the blame on the responsible adult. There were two people involved. We had an adult that was chasing a kid, and we had the kid, who I feel was afraid.\"",

The event, attended by Bush's family, including his daughters Jenna and Barbara, as well as former President George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush, was marked by humor and camaraderie.\n\nDuring his speech, Bush jokingly compared his portrait to that of George Washington, stating, \"I am pleased that my portrait brings an interesting symmetry to the White House collection: It now starts and ends with George W.\" He also playfully advised Obama to \"gaze at his portrait\" whenever he had a significant decision to make and ask himself, \"What would George do?\"\n\nThe audience, which included Bush administration officials and friends, erupted in laughter. The Obamas, in the midst of their re-election campaign, were seen focusing on the shared experiences of living in the White House and the pressures of the job.\n\nPresident Obama thanked the Bush family for their assistance during the transition in late 2008 and for the advice given to his daughters Malia and Sasha. He noted that the advice, which included enjoying the White House and its experiences, had been taken to heart by his daughters.\n\nDespite the political differences between the two administrations, the event was marked by a spirit of mutual respect and appreciation. White House spokesman Jay Carney stated, \"There were differences, I'm sure, in the past when incumbent presidents have presided over these ceremonies. But there is so much in common for the men thus far who have occupied this office and for their families who have lived in the White House, that I think there is a great deal of respect and appreciation held by everyone who is participating.\"\n\nThe event, while not addressing the political differences between the two administrations, provided a moment of unity and camaraderie in the White House.",
    " Title: Tech Privacy Concerns and Voluntary Information Sharing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent events, actress Scarlett Johansson's nude photos were leaked after a hacker obtained them from her computer, and a Pennsylvania high school remotely activated the cameras on laptops issued to students while they were away from school. These incidents highlight the growing concern over privacy in the digital age.\n\nIndividuals' personal data, including browsing habits and credit card information, is often collected by websites and companies. This information is used for targeted advertising and other purposes. In response, some individuals opt to use anti-virus software and change passwords, but the risk of data breaches remains.\n\nThe distinction between voluntary and involuntary information sharing is a key factor in privacy concerns. While individuals may willingly provide personal information to companies like Amazon or Facebook, they do not have the same level of control over government agencies accessing their data.\n\nThe National Security Agency's data mining, for example, gathers patterns of phone numbers, but does not listen to calls or know individuals' names, according to their claims. However, the important difference is whether the information sharing is voluntary.\n\nIndividuals can decide whether to use Facebook or allow private sites to install cookies to track their information. Scarlett Johansson did not give the hacker permission to steal her photos, and individuals do not give government agencies permission to access their information.\n\nWhile some argue that sharing information with companies is as involuntary, the truth is that individuals often do not check privacy policies thoroughly. The lack of concern over company data breaches is often due to the limited consequences compared to government data breaches, such as the potential for SWAT teams or imprisonment.\n\nIndividuals have adapted their behavior online, being cautious about what they email and aware that their activities may be monitored. However, the freedom to choose when to share information is a crucial aspect of privacy.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal for mandatory black box recorders in all cars raises privacy concerns, as the bureaucrats aim to track travel patterns for infrastructure planning and accident investigation. While the data collected is intended to improve road safety, the potential for misuse remains a concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the value placed on privacy varies, and individuals are often willing to give up some privacy for convenience or benefits. However, the freedom to choose when and with whom to share personal information is a key aspect of privacy that should be preserved.",
    " Title: Police in the United States Use Various Non-Lethal Weapons During Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nPolice forces across the United States have been employing a range of non-lethal weapons during ongoing protests against the police killing of George Floyd. These weapons include tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, which have at times resulted in serious injuries to protesters.\n\nTear gas, also known as CS or CN gas, is a chemical compound powder that is sprayed from canisters, causing a burning sensation in the eyes and mouth that incapacitates. Images from Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 30, 2020, depict police officers discharging tear gas amidst protesters.\n\nIn addition to tear gas, police have used pepper spray, both from handheld devices and projectiles. Pepper spray, chemically distinct from tear gas, produces similar effects: a burning and watering of the eyes and skin.\n\nPolice have also deployed pepper balls, small projectiles containing chemical irritants. These projectiles can contain PAVA spray, an irritant similar to pepper spray, as well as CS gas. They can be shot from launchers or modified paintball guns.\n\nFlashbang grenades, which explode with bright light and sound to stun and disorient demonstrators, have also been used by police.\n\nProtesters have reported being hit by a variety of rubber, plastic, and \"sponger\" bullets. In some instances, journalists in Minneapolis were shot by police with 40mm hard plastic projectiles during a protest on Saturday.\n\nIn Los Angeles, police have used rubber projectiles, and Mayor Eric Garcetti has stated that the police department will minimize their use going forward.\n\nA 2017 survey published by the British Medical Journal found that injuries from such \"kinetic impact projectiles\" resulted in death in 2.7% of cases. Protesters have also reported police using sting ball grenades, which upon explosion spray the surrounding area with rubber pellets. In addition to the rubber balls, the grenades can contain chemical agents.\n\nProtesters in Columbus, Ohio, have reported being shot with wooden bullets by police forces. Images online showed wooden dowel-shaped rods sliced into small, bullet-sized projectiles. The Columbus Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.",
    " Title: Germanwings Co-Pilot Concealed Illness, Tore Up Medical Leave Note Before Plane Crash\n\nArticle:\n\nGerman prosecutors have stated that Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot responsible for deliberately crashing a German airliner into the Alps, concealed an illness from his employers and tore up a doctor's note calling for him to go on medical leave on the day of the tragic incident.\n\nPolice found the medical certificate and other documents during a search on Thursday at Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf. Germanwings, the budget airline for which Lubitz worked, stated that it had received no such sick leave note for the day of the ill-fated flight. Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, previously declared that Lubitz was \"100% fit to fly.\"\n\nThe statement from the Dusseldorf prosecutor's office revealed no suicide note or claim of responsibility from Lubitz, who investigators believe deliberately crashed the plane on Tuesday, resulting in the deaths of all 150 people on board. The officials also stated that no evidence of a political or religious background linked to the tragedy was found.\n\nThe statement said police found medical documents \"indicating an existing illness and corresponding medical treatment.\" A torn-up current sick note, also valid for the day of the incident, was among the documents, the prosecutor said, adding that this \"would -- according to preliminary evaluation -- support the assumption that the deceased had concealed his illness towards his employer and his occupational environment.\"\n\nThe nature of Lubitz's illness remains undisclosed, although German media outlets reported he may have suffered from depression. Dusseldorf University Clinic stated that Lubitz visited the facility in February and March, most recently on March 10, for diagnosis but denied he was treated there for depression, according to Sky News reports.\n\nGermany's Federal Aviation Office has requested that Lufthansa provide access to Lubitz's medical records, DPA reports. The information would then be sent to French investigators, the news agency said.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder revealed that Lubitz deliberately locked the pilot out of the cockpit and then initiated a descent that led to the deaths of all aboard the plane bound from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, French prosecutor Brice Robin said Thursday. He provided no motive.\n\nInvestigators searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf and the home of his parents in Montabaur, about 40 miles from Bonn. They were seen removing boxes and large blue bags from both residences.\n\nUnconfirmed reports circulating in the German media suggest that Lubitz, by all official accounts a skilled pilot with a distinguished training record who was not being monitored by security services, may have been suffering from depression.\n\nBild reported that on several occasions, Lubitz's training at Lufthansa's flight school in Phoenix, Ariz., was interrupted for mental health reasons after he had a \"serious depressive episode.\" The German tabloid reported that Lubitz may have undergone treatment after being what it called \"demoted\" several times during his training in the United States.\n\nThe newspaper referred to him as a mass murderer. It said the \"episode\" was noted on his medical records held by the aviation authorities. Der Spiegel also separately reported the findings that have not been confirmed.\n\nGermany's Federal Aviation Office would not confirm the report. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Thursday that Lubitz's training was \"interrupted\" six years ago, but declined to elaborate.\n\nThomas Winkelmann, the low-cost carrier's chief executive, released a statement Friday saying that the airline has begun setting up a family assistance center in Marseille, France, and that briefings with family members will start there on Saturday.\n\n\"The suffering and pain this catastrophe has caused is immeasurable,\" he said in the statement. \"No words can express it and no amount of consolation is sufficient but we want to be there for visiting family members and friends if our support is desired.\"",
    " Title: NBC News Poll: Christie Trails Clinton in Hypothetical 2016 Match-Up, Faces Divided GOP\n\nArticle:\n\nAn NBC News poll released on Tuesday morning indicates that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical 2016 presidential match-up. The poll also suggests a divided Republican Party.\n\nThe poll, which is one of many early surveys conducted at the start of the election cycle, has Christie trailing Clinton by 53% to 40%. However, it is important to note that neither Clinton nor Christie have officially declared their candidacy for the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe first contest, if no changes occur, will be the Iowa caucuses, likely in January 2016. The general election is more than 1,000 days away.\n\nThe accuracy of polls taken at such an early stage is a matter of debate. For instance, President Rudy Giuliani had high poll numbers in 2007 due to his time as the take-charge mayor of New York on 9/11, but his poll numbers faded quickly once the GOP primaries got underway. Similarly, other potential candidates such as President Colin Powell, President Mario Cuomo, President Gary Hart, President Edmund Muskie, and others have seen their poll numbers fluctuate or decline after initially high numbers.\n\nWhile the polls will become more meaningful as the election cycle progresses, it is still early in the process. The author of the article, who covers politics full-time, expresses a desire to take a breather and focus on other issues before the election season heats up. The article concludes by noting that there are other important issues to discuss and examine in the meantime.",
    " Title: U.S. President Donald Trump to Meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg, Germany. The meeting, which will be attended by Tillerson, the U.S. Secretary of State, and Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, among others, has raised concerns due to the potential for an unpredictable outcome.\n\nAccording to reports, the meeting will involve six individuals: the presidents, Tillerson, Lavrov, and two translators. This small grouping has been criticized as a potentially dangerous approach to an already tense encounter. Lavrov, who has served as Foreign Minister since 2004, is known for his diplomatic skills and execution of Putin's foreign policy. Tillerson and the U.S. diplomatic corps have reportedly been sidelined by Trump, who appears to trust only military personnel.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, a well-informed and diplomatically astute U.S. president might use this meeting to address the issue of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. This president would acknowledge the meddling, support investigations into the matter, and pledge to take action against future interference. The president might also threaten to expose the financial dealings of senior Kremlin officials as a means of undermining Russia's status as a great power.\n\nHowever, it is expected that this meeting will not follow such a course. Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, has indicated that the president will approach the meeting informally. The outcome of the meeting remains uncertain, and the potential for unforeseen consequences is a cause for concern.\n\nIn a press briefing, the U.S. president might expand on his comments to Putin, emphasizing the seriousness with which the U.S. views Russian interference in elections, including those of NATO allies. In the event of Russian hacking into foreign elections, the U.S. might invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, which stipulates collective defense, and work with allies to respond swiftly and proportionately.\n\nThe exact nature of the meeting and its aftermath remains to be seen. The U.S. president's approach to the meeting, and his subsequent comments, will likely be closely scrutinized.",
    " Title: Indiana Primary Polling: Uncertainty Surrounds Trump and Cruz as Indiana Voting Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Indiana prepares to vote on Tuesday, the state's primary contests have received less attention due to a limited number of public telephone surveys. Only seven public telephone surveys have been conducted in Indiana over the past month, compared to nine in Wisconsin and 17 in New York before their respective primaries.\n\nThe relative scarcity of public polling, along with varying results, has added a layer of uncertainty to Tuesday's high-stakes primary. The two leading candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, could potentially strengthen their chances to win a majority of delegates on the first ballot at the convention with a decisive victory in Indiana or Cruz could gain a significant boost.\n\nTed Cruz's campaign has been eager to dismiss the new Indiana surveys showing the Texas senator trailing Trump. Cruz stated on Mike Gallagher's syndicated conservative-talk-radio show that \"Indiana is neck and neck.\" Of the seven public polls conducted over the past three weeks, Trump leads six, with Cruz's only advantage coming from an Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne survey that showed Cruz with a massive 16-point lead.\n\nAndy Downs, IPFW pollster, expressed surprise when the results came back with Cruz way on top, even questioning if the results for Cruz and Trump were incorrectly reversed. The IPFW poll differs from the other surveys in two ways: a longer, 15-day field period and not weighting results according to demographic targets.\n\nThe other public polls show Trump ahead, but by varying margins. Trump's slimmest lead came in a one-day survey conducted last Wednesday by Clout Research, with a 2-point advantage over Cruz (37% to 35%). Trump's largest lead, 17 points, was in a poll conducted last Thursday and Friday by Gravis Marketing, a prolific but less-respected firm.\n\nThe most recent reliable poll, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey conducted last Wednesday-Friday and released on Sunday, showed Trump with a commanding 15-point lead over Cruz (49% to 34%). The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll, cited two newsmaking maneuvers the Cruz campaign has attempted, such as the deal with Ohio Gov. John Kasich and naming Carly Fiorina as Cruz's running mate, as potential reasons for the results.\n\nLee Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, acknowledged that the poll may have been off in the past but emphasized their overall good track record in the primaries. IPFW's Downs acknowledged that his poll is out on a limb showing Cruz ahead but stressed that he doesn't yet know why his numbers differ from other pollsters.",
    " Title: Rep. Ilhan Omar Calls for Impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh Amid New Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has called for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following a report in The New York Times on Saturday. The report alleged that an eyewitness saw friends of Kavanaugh push \"his penis into the hand of\" a female student at a college party.\n\nHowever, on Sunday evening, The Times added to its piece that the female student did not recall the incident, according to friends, and declined to comment. An earlier version of the article, adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include this element of the book's account. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\n\nBefore The Times added what amounted to a walk-back of the new allegation, Democrats, including Omar, began calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment. On Sunday, Omar tweeted, \"Nothing terrifies this corrupt president more than the idea of Congress upholding the rule of law. We must open impeachment inquiries against Trump * and * Kavanaugh immediately. It's our constitutional duty.\"\n\nOmar has not commented or taken back her tweet as of Monday. The Times piece was adapted from a forthcoming book by two Times journalists, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, titled The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\n\nThe walk-back of the allegation was prompted by backlash from conservative media commentators and journalists, led by The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who had received an early copy of the book and noted that the book itself said that the alleged victim did not recall the incident.\n\nAfter The Times acquiesced in an \"Editors' note,\" the paper was criticized by the right and the left for omitting the important detail that the alleged female victim did not recall the incident. MSNBC's Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough questioned why The Times originally left out that the alleged victim could not recall the episode.\n\n\"Everybody makes mistakes,\" he said Monday, according to the Washington Examiner. \"We were on the phone yesterday asking each other, wait a second, there's a woman who [Max] Stier claims was abused by Kavanaugh. Has she denied this? Has she claimed this happened? Why is there this glaring omission in the New York Times story?\"\n\n\"I could not believe the New York Times would write this piece without that information contained in it,\" he added. The Times piece also failed to mention that the person making the new allegation, Max Stier, had served on former President Bill Clinton's defense team during impeachment proceedings. Kavanaugh had served on independent counsel Kenneth Starr's team.",
    " Title: The Increasing Polarization in American Politics: A Look at the Factors Influencing the Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, over the past decade and a half, has experienced a significant increase in political polarization, a concept that has become a common topic of discussion. Some argue that the nation is as divided as it was during the Civil War. This article explores the factors contributing to the polarized attitudes among Americans.\n\nOne factor identified is the influence of geographical location on political views. The BBC's video, \"The Tribes of America,\" investigates how the neighborhood in which a person resides can impact their political beliefs. Additionally, hyper-partisan news and social media contribute to Americans living in ideological isolation, allowing them to remain in an echo chamber if they choose. This isolation, fueled by anger or disenchantment towards the opposing side, discourages open dialogue and understanding of opposing viewpoints.\n\nIn the past, American politics did not exhibit such a stark divide. For instance, in 1994, moderates comprised a majority of voters, and the ideological gap between Democrats and Republicans was not as wide. However, over the past two decades, the number of moderates has significantly decreased, and Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in terms of finding common ground.\n\nThe question remains: Can America find common ground again? While it is hoped for the future, the current state of affairs does not indicate a quick resolution. Each American strives for what they believe is best for the country, but understanding complex issues and determining effective solutions is a challenging task.\n\nIn the future, it is hoped that Americans and American media will strive for integrity in the sharing of information, allowing voters to comprehend that they are in this together, whether they recognize it or not. By promoting factual and unbiased information, Americans can work towards bridging the ideological divide and finding common ground.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidate Amy Klobuchar Vows to Counter Abortion Laws, Supports Late-Term Abortions in Certain Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nPresidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has expressed her opposition to new abortion laws in Republican-led states, promising to take action if she wins in 2020. Several states, including Georgia and Alabama, have passed \"heartbeat bills,\" which prohibit abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically after six weeks - a time when many women may not yet be aware they are pregnant. Last week, Alabama enacted a law that bans nearly all abortions at any point in time, even in cases of rape or incest.\n\nKlobuchar, during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday,\" described these new laws as \"dangerous\" and \"a place that we have never seen.\" She noted that these laws would effectively make it impossible for women to obtain abortions, while also mentioning that some states are attempting to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, which could limit access to contraception.\n\nLawmakers, such as the sponsor of the Alabama law, have made it clear that the purpose of passing such sweeping restrictions on abortion is to provoke a legal challenge. Their aim is to have a case reach the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority might overturn Roe v. Wade, a landmark 1973 decision that established a woman's right to an abortion under the Constitution. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, individual states would be able to decide whether or not to keep abortion legal.\n\nTo counter this, Klobuchar promised that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, \"I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law.\"\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans have expressed concern over bills that were proposed in states including Virginia and New York, which make broad allowances for abortion, permitting it at any time during a pregnancy under certain circumstances. The Virginia bill, which sparked outrage when Delegate Kathy Tran stated it would allow abortion up until birth, failed in the state legislature. In January, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act, which removed certain restrictions on third-trimester abortions and allowed the procedure at any point in a woman's pregnancy in certain situations.\n\nKlobuchar was asked about laws like this and whether she supports legislation that permits late-term abortions. She stated that she does, in cases where the mother's life or health are in jeopardy. \"That is exactly what the Supreme Court ruling says and I am OK with that,\" she said.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders' Lead in New Hampshire Challenges Hillary Clinton's 'Inevitability'\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders is currently leading in the New Hampshire primary, according to recent polls. This development has been met with approval from some, despite the fact that Sanders is not considered a strong contender in the general election. The reason for this support lies in the belief that Sanders' presence in the race serves to challenge the perceived inevitability of Hillary Clinton's nomination.\n\nClinton continues to lead in national polls by a significant margin, with few formidable opponents challenging her for the Democratic nomination. This lack of competition has been criticized as irresponsible, given the baggage Clinton and her husband carry. The Democratic party is in need of more serious and viable candidates, or those poised to enter the race at a moment's notice.\n\nThe primary concern surrounding Clinton's campaign is the ongoing email scandal, which has been a source of controversy since it was first reported in March. The handling of the scandal, the swirl of half-truths, denials, reversals, and revelations, as well as the potential for new explosive information to come to light, has caused unease among many.\n\nFor the past five months, the email scandal has been a source of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-inspired dread, reminiscent of the scandals that plagued the Clinton family during the 1990s. The handling of the scandal, the counter-attacks from the Clinton machine, and the backtracking and self-doubts from journalists have led to a sense of uncertainty about the true nature of the story.\n\nIn addition to the email scandal, there are other concerns surrounding Clinton's campaign, including the potential for further revelations about the Clinton Foundation, Bill Clinton's sexual behavior, and his association with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire investor with a history of associating with underage prostitutes.\n\nThe timing of any potential scandals remains uncertain, but many believe it is only a matter of time before another scandal emerges, potentially impacting Clinton's campaign. The email scandal, in particular, has been a source of concern for some, with the potential for it to explode before or after the primaries, before or after the convention, or before or after the debates. The impact of such a scandal on Clinton's campaign remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen's Guilty Plea and the Obsessive Focus on Political Scandals\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Cohen, former lawyer to President Donald Trump, pleaded guilty to multiple crimes on Tuesday, including making false statements to Congress and orchestrating payments to two women to prevent them from disclosing allegations about Trump. The revelations have sparked a renewed wave of criticism towards the president, with many interpreting the developments as vindication.\n\nHowever, the impact of Cohen's court appearance on public opinion regarding Trump remains questionable. The author expresses doubts about whether the latest developments will significantly alter anyone's view of the president. The author further reflects on the potential consequences of the nation's fixation on political scandals, citing several pressing issues that require the government's attention.\n\nFor instance, it was revealed on Tuesday that the Russian military attempted to hack the websites of conservative think tanks. The United States continues to engage in low-intensity wars in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen without a clear strategic goal or measure of victory. Additionally, an assertive and self-confident China is constructing islands in the South China Sea for potential military bases, posing a threat to crucial trade routes.\n\nThe author argues that the nation's preoccupation with the \"gory details of illicit but consensual sex between adults\" and West Wing intrigue detracts from addressing these critical issues. The author expresses exhaustion and boredom with the psychodramas that consume an unnatural amount of public attention.\n\nThe author asserts that this focus on petty personal corruption serves as a harmful distraction, regardless of political affiliation. The author suggests that if individuals disagree with the president's policies, they should voice their opinions, but the fixation on personal scandals is unproductive. The author compares the current focus on Trump's alleged indiscretions to the media frenzy surrounding Bill Clinton's \"bimbo eruptions\" during his presidency.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses China and EU of Currency Manipulation, Threatens Tariffs on All Chinese Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized China and the European Union for manipulating their currencies and interest rates, stating that a stronger U.S. dollar and rising interest rates are undermining America's \"competitive edge.\" In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump indicated his readiness to impose U.S. tariffs on all Chinese imports, amounting to approximately $500 billion, the value of all U.S. imports from China last year.\n\nTrump's comments come during a week when he is facing growing pressure over his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The president's lukewarm support during a news conference with Putin for the finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 election has drawn criticism.\n\nThis marks the latest twist in an escalating trade war with countries the president accuses of trading unfairly. Until now, Trump has mostly focused on using tariffs as leverage to try to convince China and other nations to open up their markets.\n\nTrump's comments on currency and monetary policy break with decades of tradition that presidents avoid commenting directly on these matters. The Federal Reserve, which sets U.S. monetary policy, and the U.S. Treasury secretary, who is typically the chief spokesman on the dollar, are usually the primary sources of information regarding these issues. For years, the U.S. has hewed to the idea that a strong dollar is good for the U.S. economy.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to face questions about the U.S.'s dollar policy and the Fed's independence during two days of talks with G-20 counterparts in Buenos Aires this week. Mnuchin has faced criticism from international counterparts about the U.S. talking about currencies before.\n\nTrump's comments contradict a Treasury Department semi-annual report released in April that refrained from naming any country a currency manipulator based on specific criteria. The president also criticized the Fed's series of rate increases on Thursday, breaking with more than two decades of White House tradition of avoiding comments on monetary policy out of respect for the independence of the U.S. central bank.\n\nThe U.S. economy has so far proven resilient to Trump's threat of taking a trade conflict to the next level. The president has already angered allies by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum, and he is considering a widely-criticized move to levy duties on auto-imports. Trump earlier this month imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with another $16 billion to follow soon. The administration has also released a list of 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods, which could take effect as early as next month. China retaliated on the first wave of tariffs by slapping duties on the same dollar amount of U.S. imports, and Beijing has said it will fight against any further U.S. actions.",
    " Title: California Senator Diane Feinstein to Propose Legislation Banning Semi-Automatic Firearms and Large-Capacity Magazines\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Senator Diane Feinstein has announced plans to introduce legislation in January that would ban the import, export, manufacturing, sale, and transfer of semi-automatic firearms, often referred to as \"assault weapons.\" The term \"assault\" is a political one, and the proper name for the guns Feinstein is trying to ban is \"semi-automatic,\" which can include both handguns and rifles.\n\nIn an interview with NBC's David Gregory on \"Meet the Press,\" Feinstein stated that ammunition clips holding more than 10 bullets would be banned should her bill become law. \"It [the bill] will ban the sale, the transfer, the transportation, and the possession,\" Feinstein said. \"Not retroactively, but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums, or strips of more than 10 bullets.\"\n\nFeinstein's proposal is aimed at removing \"weapons of war off the streets of our cities.\" Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is protected by armed security, has been advocating for more gun control since last Friday. Bloomberg stated that gun control should be President Obama's top priority and that most gun owners support an assault weapons ban.\n\nHowever, support for the reinstatement of an assault weapons ban is at an all-time low, according to Gallup. For the first time, Gallup finds greater opposition to than support for a ban on semi-automatic guns or assault rifles, with 53% opposed and 43% in favor. In 1996, the numbers were nearly reversed, with 57% in favor and 42% opposed.\n\nDespite Mayor Bloomberg's assertions, mass shootings are not exclusive to the United States. There have been numerous instances of mass shootings in other countries, such as the predawn attack in Afghanistan on March 11, 2012, that resulted in the deaths of 16 villagers, including nine children. Similarly, there was the twin attack in Norway on July 22, 2011, in which self-styled anti-Muslim militant Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people.\n\nPresident Obama implied last night at a memorial service in Connecticut for the victims of last week's rampage that he will use his executive power to push through new gun control measures before the new Congress starts. The details of these measures have not been disclosed.",
    " Title: New York Introduces Alcohol-Filled Traps to Combat Rat Infestation\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York City officials have introduced a new method to combat its rat infestation problem. The solution involves a machine, a trap door, and a pool filled with an alcohol-based liquid. The rodents are lured by the machine and sent through a trap door into the pool, where they are knocked unconscious and eventually \"drown.\"\n\nAccording to Anthony Giaquinto, the president of Rat Trap, the importer of the device, the rodents die in the tank, which can hold up to 80 rat carcasses. During a trial in Brooklyn, a total of 107 rodents were lured and killed.\n\nRat sightings have reportedly increased by almost 38% to 17,353 last year, according to OpenTheBooks, a non-profit watchdog group. This new solution has been described as \"humane and environmentally friendly\" by Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who stated it would be rolled out in some of Brooklyn's most rat-infested districts.\n\nHowever, animal rights group PETA has criticized the new method, describing it as \"cruel and frightening.\" Elisa Allen, PETA's director, argues that the method will not effectively control overall rodent populations in the long run, as the animals remain fertile. She states that drowning, like poisoning, will be ineffective in the long run.\n\nThe city previously announced a $32 million (\u00a326 million) program in July 2017 to cull thousands of rodents by installing rat-resistant bins and trialing a liquid bait that could make rats infertile.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Criticize Trump for Requesting China to Investigate Biden\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) has joined two other Republican senators in criticizing President Donald Trump for asking China to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nCollins stated on Saturday, according to the Bangor Daily News, \"I thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent.\" She added, \"It's completely inappropriate.\"\n\nCollins joins Senators Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) in speaking out against the president's actions. House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry against Trump over his pressuring the Ukrainian president to probe the former vice president and his son over business dealings in the country.\n\nTrump's request for China to investigate the Bidens comes as Hunter Biden had business dealings in China as well. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) had a contentious exchange with NBC's Chuck Todd after the \"Meet the Press\" host asked him about comments he made to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJohnson had said he \"winced\" at the suggestion that Trump was holding back military aid from Ukraine if the country didn't probe 2016 election meddling. Asked about the comments on Sunday, Johnson attacked the CIA, FBI, and the news media.\n\n\"Can we please answer the question I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you are not criticizing him?\" Todd said. \"I'm just trying to ask a simple question of what made you wince.\"\n\nJohnson eventually explained that he didn't want aid tied to an investigation. \"When I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. He adamantly denied it. He vehemently, angrily denied it. He said, 'I'd never do that,'\" Johnson said, defending Trump.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) suggested that Trump was kidding when he said Thursday morning that \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\" Rubio stated, \"He's pretty good at getting everybody fired up. I don't think it's a real request.\"\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a top Trump ally in the House of Representatives, made similar comments on ABC's \"This Week.\" Jordan said, \"I don't think he really meant go investigate. Do you think China's going to investigate him? We know they're not. I just don't think that's what the president was really saying.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Twitter, Trump was defending his requests to Ukraine and China to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings in the two countries. Trump wrote, \"There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!\"",
    " Title: Ethan Couch's Extradition Raises Questions on Equal Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nEthan Couch, a Texas teenager who was sentenced to probation and a California rehabilitation center in 2013 for manslaughter after a drunk-driving crash that resulted in four deaths, is likely to face a tougher sentence as he is extradited from Mexico following his arrest for parole violation. The case has once again sparked discussions about equal justice under the law, with some observers noting the juxtaposition of Couch's case with the recent grand jury decision not to bring charges against the police officers involved in the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014.\n\nIn 2013, Couch was sentenced by a Texas judge to probation and rehabilitation after pleading guilty to four counts of manslaughter. The case gained national attention when a psychologist, during the trial, coined the term \"affluenza\" to describe Couch's condition, suggesting that his wealthy upbringing had led to a lack of accountability for his actions. The term sparked controversy and was later regretted by the psychologist.\n\nThe timing of Couch's capture in Mexico coincides with the grand jury decision not to bring charges against the police officers who killed Tamir Rice, a black 12-year-old who was playing with a pellet gun in a park when he was fatally shot. The case has raised questions about the application of neutral rules based on cultural factors, according to Daniel Filler, a law professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Couch case has been compared to the death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot and killed in 2012. The verdict in the Couch case was seen by many as evidence of separate justice systems in the United States, with Ethan Couch becoming a symbol of wealth and privilege.\n\nThe terms of Couch's parole suggest he could now face up to 10 years in prison, which would represent half the amount requested by prosecutors after the crash. The sentence came after Ethan pleaded guilty to four counts of manslaughter.\n\nThe Couch case has raised questions about the U.S. justice system and its treatment of different demographics. A growing list of disparities has affected how Americans think about how punishment is meted out in the United States. According to a report by the Pew Research Center, only 32 percent of Americans think the country has made enough changes to its justice system, down from 49 percent in 2014. Likewise, the percentage of Americans who say that more change is needed has risen from 46 to 59 percent in the same span.\n\nProfessor Filler suggests that events like the capture of Couch in Mexico raise public awareness about glitches in the promise of equal protection, which in turn can act as a check on the law. \"Every time you add a layer of risk that someone will detect misconduct, I think you increase the chances that misconduct [in the justice system] will be reduced,\" Filler says.",
    " Title: Tea Party Groups Focus on Immigration Bill, Threatening President Obama's Speedy Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Senate has approved its version of the immigration bill, the focus of Tea Party groups has shifted from the IRS targeting scandal to the immigration bill, potentially posing a challenge to President Obama's hopes for swift approval. The bill now rests with the House, where Republicans plan to take up their own version.\n\nDuring his Africa trip, President Obama called on the House to \"get this done\" before the August recess. However, House lawmakers are already facing conservative calls to slow down the process. If the debate extends into August, when Congress takes a nearly month-long recess, the prospects could become more uncertain.\n\nIn the 2009 August recess, the Tea Party famously helped stall ObamaCare by organizing town hall meetings and other events. Tea Party groups may be preparing to mount demonstrations during the summer break. Even if the House passes a bill this month, it's unlikely the two chambers would agree on a unified piece of legislation by August, leaving the work unfinished going into recess.\n\nThis week, dozens of conservative groups, including the Cincinnati Tea Party, sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner urging him to declare the Senate package \"dead on arrival.\" They expressed concerns that the Senate bill, by offering up to 11 million illegal immigrants a path to legal status, would make life harder for U.S. workers struggling to reach the bottom rung of the economic ladder.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Tea Party's grassroots efforts on the immigration bill remains uncertain, as the Republican Party and base are split on the issue. On health care, the movement benefited from a largely anti-Obamacare stance. On immigration, the party is divided, with 14 Republican senators voting for the bill that passed the Senate last week.\n\nSeveral influential conservative economists argue that immigration legislation would be beneficial for the economy, with newly legalized workers and an enhanced legal immigration system providing the economy with the boost it needs. Tea Party supporters, however, question the claim that the so-called \"amnesty\" would coincide with enhanced border security. They warn that mass legalization will override any security improvements.\n\nPolitical strategists view immigration as an important issue that the Republican Party should not ignore. However, Tea Partiers have a powerful tool at their disposal - the ability to threaten wavering lawmakers with a primary challenge. In South Carolina, Tea Party activists staged protests at Sen. Lindsey Graham's office, a key Republican who helped draft the bill. Ron Hughes, with the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition, stated that activists would \"love\" to see Graham face a primary challenge.\n\nHouse Republicans have stated they will proceed at their own pace, working on their own bills when it comes to immigration. Last Sunday, they dismissed a prediction by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) that the House would simply pass the Senate bill. \"The House will not simply take up and pass the Senate bill,\" a Boehner spokesman said. \"Our legislation will reflect our principles, particularly on border security.\"",
    " Title: Fox News Reduces Coverage of President Trump's Rallies Ahead of Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's rallies, a staple of his political strategy, are no longer receiving the prime-time coverage they once did on Fox News. During three rallies last week, Fox News aired clips and highlights from Trump's speeches but largely stuck with its regular weekday prime-time programming. On some occasions, the network did not air live rallies, with C-SPAN opting for other programming instead.\n\nSince Trump took office, CNN and MSNBC have mostly declined to air his campaign rallies, though they will typically carry any presidential speeches or comments to reporters. The loss of national coverage is concerning for both the White House and the candidates Trump is traveling to support.\n\nA Senate Republican campaign staffer stated, \"It exposes us to a national audience that we normally don't get to. We tend to see lots of new sign-ups and small-dollar donations. There's obviously folks streaming [rallies] online, but being able to be onstage with the president in front of a prime-time audience is huge for a campaign trying to reach conservatives across the country who will open up their wallets.\"\n\nA source close to Trump described the declining coverage as a \"huge loss on the state and local level for Republicans because they're certainly not going to get any of that on other cable networks.\"\n\nFox News and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The decrease in coverage is attributed to a variety of factors, including the sheer number of rallies, the repetitive nature of Trump's speeches, and the impact on advertising revenue during long speeches.\n\nIn 2017, Trump's events at times drew over 4 million viewers on Fox News, a number he hasn't come close to in 2018. This year, numbers have typically ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 million, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 assessment of Nielsen ratings.\n\nTrump has increased his campaign travel considerably in the final weeks before the midterm elections, leaving Fox News to decide between wall-to-wall coverage of his rallies or more selective airtime for the president. One GOP campaign operative stated, \"If every night Trump does a rally, a station carries it, you just become the president's station.\"\n\nThe president has not faulted the network for recent changes to its programming. At his Tuesday-night rally in Iowa, which wasn't aired, he heaped praise on his \"great friends\" at Fox News.",
    " Title: American Service Members Thwart Train Attack in Europe\n\nArticle:\n\nOn August 21, two American service members, U.S. Airman Spencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos, a specialist in the Oregon Army National Guard, prevented a potential tragedy on a train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris. Two people were injured in the attack, one of whom was a person with dual French/American citizenship, who was shot, and Airman Stone, who was cut by the attacker.\n\nAccording to Skarlatos, the incident lasted less than two minutes. Skarlatos, who was returning from Afghanistan, said he and Stone, a friend, noticed the attacker carrying an AK-47 and a handgun. Skarlatos stated, \"I looked over at Spencer and said, 'Let's go.' Spencer got the guy first, grabbed the guy by the neck, I grabbed the handgun.\"\n\nThe suspect was identified by French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve on Saturday as a 26-year-old Moroccan man known to Spanish authorities as belonging to \"the radical Islamist movement.\" However, Cazeneuve cautioned that the French police had not yet fully confirmed his identity. French officials had identified the man as a security risk, but he was not under surveillance and had apparently spent little time in France.\n\nAfter being arrested in Arras on Friday night, the suspect was taken early Saturday to the headquarters of the antiterrorism police outside Paris, Mr. Cazeneuve said, and was being interrogated. French news reports said that he had denied having terrorist aims and that he had said he merely intended to rob the passengers.\n\nHowever, the arsenal described by the minister suggested otherwise: a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a Luger automatic pistol, nine cartridges, and a sharp blade\u2014a \"cutter,\" the interior minister said, which he used to wound Airman Stone.\n\nThe violent encounter was over in barely two minutes. If not for the quick action by the two American servicemen and the suspect's malfunctioning automatic rifle, many lives could have been lost. Chris Norman, a British businessman who helped restrain the suspect after he had been subdued, stated, \"The guy actually came up, he pulled out a cutter, started cutting Spencer. He cut Spencer behind the neck, he nearly cut his thumb off. We eventually got him under control.\"",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Compromise on DACA, TPS, and Asylum in Bid to Break Immigration Stalemate\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's latest immigration proposal represents a shift in policy on three contentious areas, marking an attempt to break the long-standing impasse on the contentious issue. The areas in question are the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and a new path for asylum for children in Central America.\n\nIn a reversal of his previous stance, President Trump has proposed restoring and legalizing these programs, offering to enshrine them in law, providing them with a level of permanence that was not achievable during the Obama administration. In return, he is seeking $5.7 billion for his border wall project and changes to facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrant families and address abuses in the asylum system.\n\nThe proposal also includes items that both sides generally agree on, such as more technology to scan for drugs in vehicles at legal border crossings and an increase in the number of immigration judges to address the backlog of cases.\n\nVice President Mike Pence described the proposal as a \"compromise offer\" during a press briefing following President Trump's announcement. The embrace of the DACA program is a significant change, as President Trump had previously stated he would not act until the Supreme Court had ruled on his 2017 attempt to phase out the program, which protects approximately 700,000 \"Dreamers.\"\n\nIn the case of TPS, the Homeland Security Department has signaled an end to protection for as many as 300,000 individuals, some of whom have been protected for two decades. The Trump administration, in immigration negotiations last year, resisted adding protected status holders into any deal, but this resistance has reportedly dissipated.\n\nRegarding the Central American Minor program, which was canceled in 2017, President Trump is proposing to restart the program, offering full legal protections this time.\n\nDemocrats have expressed preference for a full pathway to citizenship for the 1.5 million people who could qualify for DACA and the hundreds of thousands under TPS. They also criticize the proposal as disingenuous, stating that President Trump has put Dreamers and TPS recipients at risk by rescinding their protections.\n\nThe Senate, led by Republicans, is scheduled to vote on President Trump's plans next week. However, House Democrats are unlikely to support the proposal. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, has rejected the president's proposal and stated that her chamber will vote instead on areas of overall agreement, such as immigration judges and scanning technology.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Jr.'s Speech: No Evidence of Plagiarism, According to Speechwriter\n\nArticle:\n\nThe allegations of plagiarism against Donald Trump Jr. following his speech at the Republican National Convention have been refuted by his speechwriter, Frank Buckley. Buckley, who also wrote the essay that Donald Jr.'s speech in Cleveland was based on, stated that the repetition was not a case of plagiarism, but rather a repurposing of a previous insight with permission.\n\nCritics persisted, arguing that self-plagiarism is unethical in an academic setting. However, the context of the political arena was emphasized, and the defense mounted by the Obama campaign during the 2008 cycle was brought up. In that instance, Barack Obama was accused of using unoriginal passages without attribution, a claim that was dismissed with the argument that the granting of permission made it acceptable.\n\nJon Favreau, one of Obama's former speechwriters, echoed this point on Twitter, stating that if the lines in Donald Trump Jr.'s speech were not plagiarism because the author gave permission, neither was the Obama riff from Deval, who also did not receive permission for his lines.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of plagiarism in the political arena is a complex one, with the granting of permission being a key factor in determining its acceptability. It is important to note that the sitting Vice President has also been accused and admitted to plagiarism in the past.",
    " Title: Ex-Congresswoman Halvorson Leads in Race to Fill Jackson's Seat Despite Previous Defeat\n\nArticle:\n\nDebbie Halvorson, a former Democratic congresswoman with an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA), is the front-runner in the race to replace Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. in a majority-black district that encompasses Chicago and its surrounding areas. The district, which has inner-city neighborhoods affected by gun violence, is historically represented by African-American lawmakers.\n\nDespite Halvorson's defeat in a primary against Jackson last year and the district's predominantly African-American demographic, Halvorson's support base in suburban and rural areas of the district could potentially secure her the Democratic nomination. With a crowded field of 16 candidates, a candidate could win the Democratic nomination with as little as 20% of the vote, given the district's liberal leanings.\n\nBlack leaders, concerned about Halvorson's lead in the polls, are planning to make gun control a central issue in the contest. The goal is to portray Halvorson as an NRA ally who is too conservative for the seat and insensitive to Chicago's rising tide of gun violence.\n\nHalvorson, who has described herself as a conservative Democrat, voted with her party more than 90% of the time in Congress. She supported cap-and-trade bills, President Barack Obama's health care and economic stimulus measures, and positions herself as an experienced hand who can quickly adapt to Washington after Jackson's resignation in November.\n\nHowever, it is her stance on guns that is drawing the most attention. Despite her primary rivals not directly attacking Halvorson, the campaign's focus on guns is seen as a way to differentiate herself from the front-runner.",
    " Title: Young Conservatives Advocate for Shift in GOP's Stance on Same-Sex Marriage\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of young conservative activists is advocating for a change in the Republican Party's approach to social issues, particularly regarding same-sex marriage. They argue that the GOP's current stance on the issue is driving away younger voters who would otherwise support the party.\n\nRyan Rauner, a leader of NextGen GOP, organized an event last week in Arlington, Virginia, to discuss this issue. Rauner stated, \"We need more compassion, empathy, and tolerance, and, unfortunately, sometimes tolerance means tolerance of intolerance. What we can never tolerate is the power of government being used by one group against another because they disagree with their beliefs or their lifestyle. That's not freedom; that's not equality.\"\n\nAccording to Gallup polling released Wednesday, a record 60 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage, a 5-percentage-point increase from last year and a 20-point jump since 2009. Among younger Americans, the issue is even more settled, according to conservative activists.\n\nJerri Ann Henry, the campaign manager for Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry, stated, \"There are a lot of LGBT people out there who are brilliant small business owners, who hold to the principles of limited government, strong families, fiscal conservatism, and strong national security\u2014things that we as Republicans love\u2014but they don't have a place in the Republican Party right now.\"\n\nWhile support for traditional marriage helps Republicans more than it hurts, only 26 percent of voters said it is a make-or-break issue, and a candidate must share their opinion on the issue to win their vote. Among those who oppose gay marriage, 37 percent said a candidate must agree with them, compared to only 27 percent who support recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nRepublican analysts doubted that the 2016 elections will see any major policy shifts for Republicans on the issue, stating that even for most young voters, it's not a threshold issue. Mary Anna Mancuso, a former campaign director for former Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack's Senate race and founder of Political Hype, said, \"I think that it's an issue that polls well, but I'm not sure it's an issue that's going to vote well.\"\n\nIn reaching young voters, harnessing a digital campaign will likely be critical, and Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio, two already-announced candidates, have done well on that score, according to Alex Patton, owner of Ozean Consulting. However, on a national level, it would be in a candidate's best interest to stress issues that rank higher on the scale of importance for millennials like job security and growing the economy rather than same-sex marriage, Mr. Patton said.\n\nThe issue could matter in certain swing states with large youth populations, such as Florida, according to Mr. Patton. \"All of these little small things will add up. None of them will be decisive on a national scale, but it could matter in a state as important as Florida, where the line is razor-thin,\" Mr. Patton said. \"A tenth of a point here can be the difference between winning and losing.\"\n\nThe conservatives at the rally said they don't expect same-sex marriage to be the tipping point in the 2016 election, but they want to see more Republicans embrace it. Sara Coleman, a realtor who attended the rally, stated, \"Overwhelmingly, Republicans across the country are still going to be viewed as anti-that, anti-equality, and [anti-] marriage, and it's a shame. But all you can do is develop these little core groups, let them rise up, and eventually they will become the norm. So in this election, no, I don't think that marriage equality will be the deciding factor or big issue, but as the nation develops through the course of the years, eventually we will be on the right side of history.\"",
    " Title: Trump Submits Written Answers to Mueller's Probe, Avoids Post-Election Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has provided written answers to questions from Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with the Trump campaign. This was announced by Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Tuesday.\n\n\"We answered every question they asked that was legitimately pre-election and focused on Russia,\" Giuliani said in an interview. \"Nothing post-election. And we've told them we're not going to do that.\"\n\nGiuliani stated that Trump did not plan to answer any questions from Mueller regarding whether he attempted to obstruct the investigation after taking office, such as by firing former FBI Director James Comey.\n\n\"It is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion,\" the lawyer said in a statement earlier on Tuesday, announcing that Trump's answers had been submitted in the probe, which Trump has repeatedly referred to as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nTrump signed the submission on Tuesday before departing Washington to spend the Thanksgiving holiday in Florida, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 to probe \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\" into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to try to tip it toward Trump by undermining Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nAmong the topics Trump answered questions about on Tuesday was a June 2016 meeting between the president's son Donald Trump Jr., other members of Trump's campaign team, and a group of Russians. Trump has denied knowing about the Trump Tower meeting with the Russians, who had promised damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nOther questions may have touched on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally with ties to WikiLeaks, who is also under investigation.\n\n\"There were no real big surprises in the questions. They were detailed, complex, they were multipart,\" Giuliani said. He would not say how many questions there were.\n\nMueller has already brought charges against some former Trump aides, including his former campaign chairman and his former national security adviser, as well as a number of Russian individuals and entities. U.S. prosecutors are also preparing to pursue a criminal case against Assange, having obtained a sealed indictment that was revealed in an unrelated criminal case filing last week.\n\nWikiLeaks is known for publishing documents that were previously not public. During the campaign, the group published Democratic emails that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded were hacked by Russia. Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign.\n\nGiuliani said in the statement on Tuesday the president had provided \"unprecedented cooperation\" with the probe over the past year and a half, noting that more than 30 White House-related witnesses had been questioned and 1.4 million pages of material turned over before Trump responded to the pre-election questions in writing.\n\nHe added that \"much of what has been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry.\"\n\nGiuliani later told CNN there was \"very little hope\" Trump would sit for an interview with the special counsel. Trump's lawyers have been negotiating with Mueller's prosecutors since last year over whether the president would sit for an interview. Trump himself has offered mixed responses.\n\nIn an interview that aired on Sunday, he told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he was unlikely to do so, explaining that \"we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt, and the answer is, probably, we're finished.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Mueller would subpoena him to testify, likely setting off a legal and political battle. Earlier this month, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointed Matthew Whitaker as his replacement on an acting basis, renewing calls for legislation to protect Mueller's work. As a private citizen, Whitaker criticized the Mueller probe. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed such legislation.\n\nLisa Kern Griffin, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Duke University, said she was skeptical much of what had been asked was outside the scope of legitimate authority, as Giuliani maintained.\n\n\"The special counsel has a broad mandate to determine what took place during the campaign and to determine whether there has been an effort to obstruct that investigation,\" Griffin said. \"As other presidents have found out, they are not above the law.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Debate Expected to Break Viewership Records as Clinton and Trump Prepare for High-Stakes Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump is anticipated to be one of the most-watched political events in American history, with viewership potentially reaching 80 million, akin to the audience for the 1980 debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. One-third of voters consider the debates crucial in deciding their presidential preference, making it a significant opportunity for both candidates to present their case for the presidency.\n\nThe first presidential debate, along with the subsequent debates on October 9 and October 19, is expected to be characterized by political and personal attacks, departures from the truth, particularly from Mr. Trump, who has a history of disregarding factual constraints.\n\nIn an effort to appeal to undecided or third-party-leaning voters, approximately 20% of likely November voters, Mrs. Clinton must either attract these voters to her camp or prevent them from supporting Mr. Trump. Historically, the Democratic candidate has won more votes than the Republican candidate in five out of the last six presidential elections, suggesting that if Mrs. Clinton can mobilize regular Democratic voters, she will be in a strong position on Election Day.\n\nTo achieve this, Mrs. Clinton is expected to address the concerns of today's Democratic coalition, a multiracial, multicultural, and multilingual group with diverse interests. She is likely to emphasize her commitment to social justice issues and a reform of the U.S. immigration system, and remind black and Hispanic voters of Mr. Trump's past comments questioning President Barack Obama's birthplace.\n\nMrs. Clinton is the second least popular major-party presidential nominee in the history of modern polling, with Mr. Trump holding the top spot. While it is important to offer voters someone to support, Mrs. Clinton must be careful not to allow Mr. Trump to redefine himself as a candidate who could be a viable president for suburban women and college-educated white voters, who are swing demographics that Mr. Trump lags behind in what a Republican needs to win a national election.\n\nTo counter Mr. Trump's attacks, Mrs. Clinton will need to challenge him in real-time on inaccurate statements he makes during the debate. Mr. Trump's unpredictability, a trait that has seen him make provocative statements, such as boasting about the size of his genitalia during a primary debate, is his biggest advantage. However, his unpredictability also presents a risk, as there is no guarantee of what he will do on the biggest stage of the campaign.\n\nAlready, Mr. Trump has demonstrated this unpredictability, as evidenced by his Twitter invitation to Gennifer Flowers, with whom Bill Clinton reportedly had an affair, to attend the debate as his guest. This move was later clarified by Trump's running mate Mike Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, stating that she had not been invited.\n\nTo win over voters and appear presidential, Mr. Trump will need to demonstrate a command of policy sufficient to run the federal government. Refreshing his long-cemented image will be a challenging task, but if he is to achieve it, he will need to display discipline and preparedness during the debate that he has not demonstrated to date.\n\nMr. Trump's biggest opening lies in Mrs. Clinton's unpopularity. He would be wise to weave issues such as her use of a personal email server and questions about the Clinton Foundation's fundraising practices into his responses. However, Mr. Trump must exercise caution in presenting his case against Mrs. Clinton, avoiding exaggerations and falsehoods that could distract from his message.\n\nRyan Praises Trump's Outreach to Black Voters: 'Half of It Is Just Showing Up' - This statement is a separate news item and not directly related to the upcoming presidential debate.",
    " Title: GOP Divided Over Bill Allowing Undocumented Immigrants to Serve in U.S. Military\n\nArticle:\n\nA split within the Republican Party has emerged over a bill that would allow undocumented immigrants, often referred to as Dreamers, to serve in the U.S. military. Cesar Vargas, a Dreamer and co-director of the Dream Action Coalition, has advocated for legislation to provide a path to citizenship for immigrants like him, with the goal of becoming a military lawyer.\n\nVargas, who was brought to the United States from Mexico illegally when he was 5 years old, expressed his desire to serve the country he calls home. \"This is the reality for us,\" Vargas said. \"This is the country we call home... What it really comes down to is the commitment to serve the country you call home, the country you want to wear a uniform for.\"\n\nRep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) has been a proponent of a bill that would grant legal status to young undocumented immigrants who serve in the military. An amendment, sponsored by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), to a must-pass defense-policy bill encourages the Pentagon to consider allowing immigrants brought to the country as children to serve in the military.\n\nHowever, this amendment has faced opposition from conservatives, led by Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, who argue that it threatens the passage of the $612 billion defense-policy bill, which typically passes with broad bipartisan support. In a letter to the House Rules Committee, more than two dozen House Republicans threatened to oppose the defense bill if the immigration provision was not removed.\n\nBrooks claimed that the amendment could lead to the Pentagon exempting Dreamers from citizenship and lawful immigrant requirements to serve in the military. \"That is not the sense of Congress,\" Brooks said, \"and it's certainly not the sense of the American people to put already struggling American families in the position of not only having to compete in the private sector with illegal aliens, but also trying to compete for military service positions.\"\n\nGallego's amendment passed with the support of House Armed Services Committee Democrats and six Republicans, including Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), who served in both Iraq wars. Coffman, who supports immigration reform, expressed his disappointment with his Republican colleagues for opposing the amendment. \"I'm disappointed in my colleagues for fighting this,\" Coffman said. \"I'm not sure why they're so opposed to this. I've been in the Congress side by side with people who are opposed to this, but yet they themselves did not want to serve. These young people ought to have the opportunity to serve.\"\n\nThe bill is expected to be taken up by the full House this week and then must go to the Senate, where Arizona Sen. John McCain leads the Armed Services Committee. McCain has stated that there will not be a similar provision included in his committee's version of the bill.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Freeze on Vehicle Fuel Economy Requirements, Challenging California's Emissions Authority\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed to freeze vehicle fuel economy requirements at the 2020 level and revoke California's authority to set more stringent tailpipe emissions standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) jointly proposed on Thursday to cap fleetwide fuel economy at 37 miles per gallon starting in 2020, a move that would reverse the gradual increase to roughly 47 mpg by 2025 under the Obama administration's plan.\n\nThe proposal also aims to revoke California's authority under the Clean Air Act, which has allowed the state to set rules more stringent than federal ones limiting tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions and an electric-vehicle sales mandate. The move is seen as an aggressive step to dismantle one of the most significant efforts to combat climate change.\n\nThe proposal begins a 60-day period of public comment, during which California's leaders and environmentalists are expected to respond vigorously. Automakers, who have expressed misgivings about accommodating a patchwork of federal and state standards, are also likely to comment on the proposal.\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao stated, \"There are compelling reasons for a new rulemaking on fuel economy standards for 2021-2026. More realistic standards will promote a healthy economy by bringing newer, safer, cleaner, and more fuel-efficient vehicles to U.S. roads, and we look forward to receiving input from the public.\"\n\nIn March 2017, President Donald Trump announced his administration would reopen a review of the Obama automobile rules, citing their unfairness. The Trump administration's rule-making proposal also presents several other options for modifying the Obama targets, while recommending the proposed freeze starting in 2020, the most severe of the scenarios.\n\nIn a separate move, the proposal also asserts that a 1975 law prohibits states from setting their own greenhouse gas limits, a view two federal district judges have already rejected. A 60-day comment period will begin once the proposal is published in the Federal Register, and a final rule could be finalized by the end of 2018 or early next year.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that its proposed freeze will have a \"negligible\" impact on air quality and boost the Earth's temperature by 3/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100. The administration also claims that its preferred plan for fuel economy will reduce society-wide spending by $502 billion for vehicles built between 1975 and 2029.\n\nCritics question the administration's cost estimates, with Nic Lutsey, an engineer at the International Council on Clean Transportation, stating, \"This would be utterly unprecedented. Nobody in any regulatory agency has ever done a cost-benefit analysis anything like this. There's no evidence that efficiency regulations have depressed sales and added fatalities as a result -- in any market in the world.\"\n\nThe efficacy of the administration's cost estimates will shape the plan's public acceptance and its ability to withstand court challenges. California, 16 states, and the District of Columbia have already filed a lawsuit challenging the plan's scientific underpinnings.",
    " Title: Trump Warns Iranian Government Amid Ongoing Protests Over Downed Plane Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of escalating protests and public outrage in Iran, President Donald Trump issued a direct warning to the Iranian government on Sunday via a Twitter post. \"To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,\" Mr. Trump stated. \"Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!\"\n\nThe protests in Iran intensified on Sunday following the Iranian government's admission that it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane last week, resulting in the deaths of all 176 passengers and crew members and sparking international condemnation. The incident occurred shortly after Iran launched ballistic missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq, bringing Washington and Tehran to the brink of all-out war.\n\nThe demonstrations across Iran reveal a growing internal anger towards the Iranian government itself. Initially, Iranian leaders denied responsibility for the downing of the plane, only to later reverse their stance as the truth became apparent.\n\n\"They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here,\" a group of Iranian protesters reportedly shouted during a demonstration in Tehran, according to Reuters. Protesters also reportedly chanted \"Death to the dictator,\" referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIranian leaders have since apologized for the incident and pledged to prosecute those responsible.\n\nTrump administration officials on Sunday reaffirmed their willingness to engage in negotiations with the Iranian government for a permanent end to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Simultaneously, U.S. officials sought to exploit the growing protests and create a rift between the government in Tehran and Iranian citizens.\n\n\"They want the same things that most people around the world want. They want prosperity,\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" program on Sunday. \"They want the ability to live their lives, to raise their children. And we do support those same aspirations for people wherever they are. I just think you see a very corrupt regime that the Iranian people are finally standing up and trying to hold them accountable.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Announces New Healthcare Price Transparency Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced new rules that will require hospitals and insurance companies to disclose the actual prices for common medical tests and procedures. The aim is to promote competition and reduce costs. However, these sweeping changes face opposition from the healthcare industry and could potentially be challenged in court.\n\nThe final rule will apply to hospitals, while a proposed regulation will apply to insurance plans. The disclosure requirements for hospitals will not take effect until 2021, and the timing for insurers is unclear. The rules do not directly affect doctors.\n\nThe new rules are intended to illuminate the complex maze of healthcare prices, enabling informed patients to find quality services at the lowest cost. For instance, the cost of an MRI scan can vary by hundreds of dollars depending on the location.\n\nInsurers will be required to provide individualized estimates of what patients would owe out-of-pocket due to deductibles and copayments.\n\nThe healthcare industry and insurance companies argue that the push for disclosure goes too far. They contend that the government would force them to publicly disclose rates negotiated as part of private contracts, which are typically beyond the purview of authorities.\n\nInsurers also express concern that the plan could lead to providers raising their prices if others are getting more. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar dismissed this concern, calling it a \"canard,\" stating that transparency does not lead to higher prices in any other area of the economy.\n\nIf the industry decides to take legal action, it could be a prolonged process before consumers see any significant changes.\n\nThe new rules will require the publication of negotiated rates for the 300 most common services that can be scheduled in advance, such as a knee replacement, a Cesarean-section delivery, or an MRI scan. Hospitals will also have to disclose what they would accept if a patient pays cash. The information will be updated annually.\n\nIn addition, hospitals will be required to publish all their charges in a format that can be read on the internet by other computer systems. This will allow web developers and consumer groups to create tools that patients and their families can use.\n\nThe administration is also working on creating an online tool that policyholders can use to get a real-time personalized estimate of their out-of-pocket costs for all covered healthcare services and items, from hospitalization to doctor visits, lab tests, and medicines.\n\nThe disclosure requirements will implement an executive order signed by President Donald Trump this summer.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Decision in Eric Garner Case Sparks Outcry and Calls for Federal Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the announcement of a grand jury decision on Wednesday not to indict a New York police officer in the death of Eric Garner, politicians and community leaders have weighed in, expressing their views on the incident and its implications for police-community relations.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder stated that the Department of Justice will investigate the cases of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand expressed her condolences to Garner's family and called for accountability, stating, \"Nobody unarmed should die on a New York City street corner for suspected low-level offenses.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged the tragedy of Garner's death and the need for respect for the legal process and rule of law. He also suggested that the federal government may conduct additional investigations and reviews in this case, and that improvements could be made to better the system.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-Brooklyn/Queens, questioned the grand jury's decision, stating that it was difficult to understand how the officer's actions did not result in charges of second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton has called for a national march in Washington, D.C. on December 13 to halt police brutality and ask for the Department of Justice to prosecute NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer in the Garner case. Sharpton's National Action Network will meet with the National Urban League, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, and the Black Women's Roundtable on Thursday in New York City to discuss further action.\n\nGarner's mother, Gwen Carr, questioned the justice system's ability to protect minority communities, stating, \"How could we put our trust in the justice system when they fail us like this?\"\n\nStaten Island Borough President James Oddo called for calm and asserted that disagreeing with the grand jury's decision and peacefully protesting is a right. Police commissioner Bill Bratton assigned extra police for Staten Island in anticipation of potential protests.\n\nPatrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, issued a statement expressing remorse for Garner's death but not accepting responsibility for his actions during the incident. Garner's attorney, Stu London, stated that the officer was relieved and emotional upon learning of the grand jury's decision.\n\nGarner's mother, Gwen Carr, and his wife, Emerald Garner, have consistently carried themselves with grace during the past four months, expressing their heartache and demanding accountability for their husband and father's death.",
    " Title: Death Toll Rises to 50 in Las Vegas Shooting: Witness Accounts and Latest Updates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a deadly shooting incident at a country music festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night, survivors and witnesses recounted their harrowing experiences as the death toll rose to 50 and over 400 people were reported injured.\n\nThe attack occurred during a concert by Jason Aldean at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, with the gunman opening fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. The two gold towers of the Mandalay Bay overlook the concert site.\n\nWitnesses described the initial confusion as the gunfire began, with some mistaking the sound for issues with the speakers. Jason Aldean continued playing through three rounds of gunfire before the concertgoers took the incident more seriously.\n\nSurvivors spoke of running for their lives, jumping walls, and climbing cars to escape the hail of bullets. Some huddled together for protection, while others were trampled in the chaos.\n\n\"It was hysteria,\" said Jackie Hoffing, still in a state of trauma. \"There were people trampled. We jumped walls, climbed cars, ran for our lives. I've never run that hard or been that scared in my whole life.\"\n\nThe gunshots were described as sounding as though they were coming from different directions and getting closer each time the shooter reloaded. Many took cover under tables, behind buildings, and behind police cars.\n\n\"I didn't want to get up because I didn't want to get mistaken for a bad guy and get shot,\" said Kevin Kropf, who took cover under a table and waited for tactical police units to arrive.\n\nThe streets between the concert grounds and the nearest medical center were a non-stop convoy of ambulances and police. Survivors emerged from apartment buildings, motels, parking garages, and other emergency shelters, with nowhere to go as the Strip remained on lockdown.\n\nReports of gunmen and shootings at other hotels circulated on social media, adding to the chaos and panic. The authorities have not confirmed these reports.\n\nAs of the time of this report, the identity of the shooter has not been officially confirmed by the authorities, and the motive behind the attack remains unknown. The investigation is ongoing.",
    " Title: Yang Proposes Licensing Reform to Boost Mobility and Economic Dynamism\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has introduced a plan to reform licensing requirements in an effort to stimulate mobility and economic dynamism in the United States. The proposal aims to help lower-income individuals move to areas with better job prospects by increasing state-by-state recognition of occupational licenses.\n\nAccording to data from the Tax Foundation, mobility in the U.S. has significantly decreased over the years. In 1948, 22.2% of Americans moved, but this figure dropped to an all-time low of 11.2% in 2015-2016.\n\nYang's plan includes increasing state-by-state recognition of occupational licenses, a practice currently adopted by only three states: Arizona, Montana, and Pennsylvania. Licensing requirements often restrict workers from moving to different states and continuing their profession due to the lack of out-of-state recognition of their licenses. This results in additional costs and burdensome licensing processes when workers relocate.\n\nA 2017 paper by labor economists Janna Johnson and Morris Kleiner found that more than 33% of U.S. professions now require a state-issued license. The researchers discovered that workers in licensed professions were, on average, 36% less likely to move across state lines than workers in non-licensed professions.\n\nIn addition to licensing reform, Yang's plan includes a tax credit of up to $1,000 for moving expenses. The tax code previously provided for an above-the-line deduction for similar claims, but this provision was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nGarrett Watson, Special Projects Manager at the Tax Foundation, suggests that Yang's proposed tax credit for moving expenses could stimulate the economy. However, Watson cautions that it would need to be part of a larger set of reforms, including reducing licensing burdens and zoning laws that drive up housing costs, to make a significant impact.",
    " Title: Trump's Town Hall Performance in Wisconsin: A Focus on Salesmanship Over Substance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a town hall setting moderated by Greta Van Susteren on Fox News in Madison, Wisconsin, Donald Trump delivered an hour-long performance that left the impression of a skilled salesman rather than a political candidate. The event took place amidst what is believed to be a challenging week for Trump's campaign.\n\nDuring the town hall, Trump did not clarify or retract any of his controversial statements on various topics, including his stance on abortion, NATO, and trade deals. He reiterated his plans to repeal Obamacare, lower taxes, renegotiate trade deals, and bring jobs back to the United States, but provided few details on how these plans would be executed.\n\nTrump emphasized his intention to address the drug epidemic in New Hampshire, offering specifics on this issue. He also mentioned his plan to speak with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to address the issue of drug trafficking.\n\nThe Republican nomination battle remains ongoing, with Trump continuing to campaign. Ted Cruz, on the other hand, reportedly gained at least 18 delegates in North Dakota during the same evening, a significant development in the long-running race.\n\nTrump's approach to the town hall meeting has been compared to Muhammad Ali's \"Rope a Dope\" strategy, where the boxer would evade punches to wear out his opponents. Trump's strategy appears to involve talking extensively without providing specifics, a tactic that has been a hallmark of his campaign.\n\nDespite the lack of detailed policy discussions, Trump maintained a positive outlook, promising a \"greatest,\" \"cheapest,\" and \"best-looking\" presidency. However, the specifics of his plans remain unclear.",
    " Title: Trump's Unorthodox Foreign Policy Approach: Achievements and Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who was primarily elected on domestic issues, has made a significant impact on foreign affairs in his first 16 months in office. The president's international actions, such as withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, are the latest in a series of substantial foreign policy moves.\n\nIn contrast, Trump's major domestic achievements have been limited to the passage of a large tax cut in December and the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice over a year ago. However, in the international arena, the list of substantive actions is far longer.\n\nTrump has initiated efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula with a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a historic event. He has also pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, made gains against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and increased troop levels in Afghanistan.\n\nRepublican strategist Alex Conant, who worked for Trump rival Sen. Marco Rubio during the 2016 primaries, acknowledged that when it comes to foreign policy, \"He has exceeded the expectations of his critics. He is very unorthodox, but that isn\u2019t to say he hasn\u2019t seen some early successes.\"\n\nTrump's approach seems to be driven less by any putative Trump doctrine and more by instinct. Few experts are sure of Trump's exact position on the ideological spectrum when it comes to foreign policy, given his zigzags on issues including North Korea and Syria.\n\nTrump loyalists see this trait as an asset, showing a useful flexibility. Detractors, however, insist that the president's approach breeds new instabilities. Joel Rubin, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of State during the Obama administration, said that Trump \"really lacks a clear, coherent approach around which adversaries, allies, and the agencies\u2014the three As\u2014can orient themselves.\"\n\nRubin cited the example of the recent visit to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron's primary hope as he crossed the Atlantic was that the Iran nuclear deal could somehow be saved. But he ultimately failed to sway Trump or even get significant concessions, despite having taken significant political risks in making the trip.\n\nTrump, however, clearly thinks that foreign policy figures in both parties are not so wise as they believe themselves to be. Exhibit A in defense of the president's unorthodox approach is North Korea. When Trump blasted Kim and threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea during a speech at the United Nations in September, numerous experts predicted a downward spiral in relations\u2014and feared that war was a real possibility.\n\nInstead, Trump executed an abrupt change of tack in March, agreeing to a meeting with Kim in response to an offer conveyed through South Korea. Skeptics note there is no guarantee that anything of substance will emerge from the Trump-Kim summit, set for June 12 in Singapore. But the mere fact that it is happening\u2014the first-ever meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. president\u2014is a considerable boost for Trump's approach.\n\nSupporters argue that it is part of a broader picture in which Trump is persistently underestimated. \"He doesn\u2019t articulate and conceptualize things in the way a traditional bureaucrat does,\" said James Jay Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. \"There is the showman Trump and the serious Trump. We just see the showman\u2014the tweets and everything else. But you can\u2019t understand the foreign policy just by looking at the surface.\"\n\nCarafano argued that the idea of Trump as a chaotic figure was exaggerated. \"This is not a scattershot president. This is not a presidency lurching from fire to fire,\" he said. \"This is a president going out very deliberately and pursuing policy. [The administration] clearly have a policy direction. They have made all the big policy decisions and now they are just in execution mode.\"\n\nTrump has found that executing foreign policy is in some respects easier than domestic policy. The president's frequent campaign trail promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, foundered during his first year in office. Another huge campaign slogan\u2014building a wall on the southern border\u2014is still a long way from realization, with Congress balking at providing funding.\n\nAmid those frustrations, Trump and Republicans see his foreign policy record as something to tout. It may be difficult for Trump to reap many electoral benefits from his moves, however. \"Voters primarily care about what impacts them and their families,\" said Conant. \"Faraway threats that don\u2019t directly involve American lives can be hard to get voters to prioritize.\"\n\nThere may be political gains to be harvested by incorporating foreign policy achievement into a broader narrative, however. As the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem opened on Monday, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, in rare public remarks, stated: \"While presidents before him have backed down from their pledge to move the American Embassy once in office, this president delivered. Because when President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it.\"\n\nThe idea that Trump keeps his promises is repeated often by his allies, even as it is fiercely contested by critics. \"The world looks to the United States for predictability and stability. When you look at the world today, few people say it needs more instability. That\u2019s the concern many people have when it comes to foreign policy.\"",
    " Title: Al Franken's Impact on Political Polarization in Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nThe search for a culprit responsible for the polarization, gridlock, and negative feelings in Washington D.C. can be traced back to Senator Al Franken. This is not a personal attack on Franken, but rather an examination of the potential consequences of his narrow victory in the 2008 Minnesota Senate race.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, if Franken had lost the Senate race by several hundred votes instead of winning by a razor-thin margin that prompted months of recounts, the Democratic Party would have had only 59 votes in December 2009. This would have required them to corral at least one Republican vote to pass ObamaCare.\n\nPresident Obama faced little real resistance in Congress to start his presidency, and this lack of opposition set the stage for the polarization to come. Without a Democratic supermajority, Obama would have been forced to negotiate with Republicans (or, at least, former Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine) and settle for incremental health care legislation that his then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel recommended. The GOP would still have been opposed to any Democratic health care reforms, but the antipathy would have been muted because a few Republicans would have supported the legislation.\n\nInstead of provoking a pitched partisan showdown that culminated with then-House Minority Leader John Boehner exclaiming that the Congress had \"shattered the bonds of trust\" with the American people, Obama could have tempered the wrath of the Republican opposition.\n\n\"In a democracy, you can only ignore the will of the people for so long and get away with it,\" Boehner presciently argued before the House's fateful ObamaCare vote. \"If we defy the will of our fellow citizens and pass this bill, we are going to be held to account by those who have placed us in their trust.\"\n\nImagine, for a moment, the state of the 2010 midterms without ObamaCare in the equation. Republicans would have run against the stagnant economy with some success. But without the galvanizing opposition to Obama's health care law\u2014Republicans netted a whopping 63 House seats that year\u2014Democrats would likely have narrowly kept control of Congress, and continued to press forward with Obama's agenda. There would be tea-party-aligned Republicans elected, but absent the wave, not enough to form the concerted opposition that emerged. Veteran Blue Dog Democrats like Reps. Ike Skelton, Gene Taylor, and Chet Edwards (among others) would likely have been reelected, and become bridge-builders between parties.\n\nThe notion of moderate pragmatism prevailing might sound like fantasy to readers who have watched the political cage-fighting over the last seven years. But even in our polarized times, politics is still primarily about self-interest.\n\nObama acted against his political self-interest in pushing ObamaCare through Congress, but given the divided government that ensued, it then made some sense for him to play to his base in his reelection campaign and stick to his liberal principles after winning. At the same time, Republicans would have been committing political malpractice if they ignored the tea-party tsunami that enveloped the country in 2010. With intensifying energy on the Right, the biggest political threat to members emerged from within their own party, and they adapted accordingly.\n\nThe question then becomes: Who started the fire? Obama certainly deserves some of the blame, and he has admitted recently that one of his biggest regrets as president was the polarization that he's leaving behind. The problem is that he hasn't connected his early actions with what transpired.\n\nThe notion that Obama was fated to face an intransigent Republican opposition has always been off-base. He won a historically-high 53 percent of the vote in 2008, bringing Democratic congressional seats that they hadn't won in decades, including ones in rural Alabama and Louisiana. He even won 40 percent of non-college-educated whites\u2014a remarkable tally given how despised he is among this constituency today. Democrats had all the political tools they needed to press Obama's widespread personal popularity into an agenda that could pick off enough moderate Republicans to succeed. (Just consider an alternate reality in which legislation addressing income inequality, job-skills training, and the costs and quality of college education were the centerpieces of an Obama agenda after the recession.)\n\nBut it's also understandable that Obama, eager to be seen as a historically-consequential president, would want to spend all of his political capital early on the Democratic dream of expanding public access to health care\u2014political backlash be damned.\n\nThat's where Al Franken comes in. If it weren't for 312 voters in Minnesota, Obama's ambitions would at least have been curtailed by legislative realities, and the trajectory of his presidency would have looked much different. Franken, the first insult comic to get elected to the Senate, circuitously paved the way for the rise of a much different type of entertainer\u2014Donald J. Trump.",
    " Title: Donald Sterling's First Amendment Rights Intact Despite NBA Scandal, Says Legal Expert\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent uproar surrounding Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling's racist remarks about black people, many have questioned whether his First Amendment rights were violated. However, according to legal expert Marc J. Randazza, while Sterling's privacy rights may have been violated, his First Amendment rights remain intact.\n\nThe First Amendment protects individuals from governmental punishment due to their speech. The National Basketball Association (NBA), as a private club, has the right to discipline Sterling as it sees fit. The criticism leveled against Sterling is not a violation of his First Amendment rights, but rather an example of the marketplace of ideas in action.\n\nRandazza points out that the recording of Sterling's conversation may have been illegal, and the leaking of the recording was morally wrong. The recording, featuring Sterling and V. Stiviano, may have been the result of a crime, as California law requires the knowledge or consent of both parties to record a conversation.\n\nRandazza argues that we all have private conversations that we might not share publicly, and we should have the freedom to make the choice of whether to make those ideas public. The Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who made his own controversial and bigoted statements, is an example of someone who chose to make his statements public and faces the consequences.\n\nRandazza warns that the public character execution of Sterling could lead to a world where individuals fear expressing unpopular views, even in private conversations. He compares this to George Orwell's novel \"1984,\" where the Telescreen, a device that beamed information into the home but also spied on people constantly, represents a world where there is no privacy.\n\nRandazza concludes that the Sterling story is not just about finding a bigot and condemning him, but about the breakdown of privacy and trust in society. He questions whether we now live in a world where we can trust nobody and where there is no privacy. Randazza suggests that we should condemn the complete breakdown of privacy and trust at least as loudly as we condemn Sterling's racist remarks.",
    " Title: New Congress Takes Office, Prioritizing Healthcare Reform, Regulatory Rollbacks, and Cabinet Confirmations\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Congress took office in the nation's capital on Tuesday, with the swearing-in ceremony led by re-elected Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. The 115th Congress, which opens with Republicans in full control of both chambers and the White House for the first time in almost a decade, is eager to get to work.\n\nTop on the agenda is the potential scrapping of President Barack Obama's signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Republican lawmaker Cory Gardner of Colorado stated, \"We'll work to repair the damage of Obamacare.\" He added, \"A law that was sold on broken promises to the American people. A law that has led to soaring premiums, failing insurance markets, and dwindling choices.\"\n\nHouse lawmakers are also planning bills to roll back thousands of federal regulations imposed by the Obama administration on various sectors, including the environment, drilling, and businesses.\n\nThe confirmation of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet nominees is another priority. Democrats are reportedly planning to target at least eight of Trump's 15 cabinet picks, according to The Washington Post. However, the confirmation process may present challenges, as Democrats have vowed not to make it easy.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed concern that the incoming administration might \"lose their nerve\" in taking on the Democrats. He stated, \"I worry that when they realize how big the problem is, that they decide that they're just going to do the best they can and give in.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans have already backed down from a controversial last-minute plan to revise congressional oversight, following heavy criticism from both sides. The plan involved reining in the independent Congressional Ethics Office and putting it under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee.\n\nPresident-elect Trump has also expressed concern about this decision, tweeting, \"With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority?\"\n\nIn foreign policy, President Trump will face a series of challenges, including dealing with Russia, the ongoing battle to defeat ISIS, the ongoing chaos in Syria, and North Korea's recent announcement of its plans to test launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. On Monday, Trump tweeted about North Korea's missile ambitions, saying, \"It won't happen\" on his watch.",
    " Title: Justice Department Declares Case Against Andrew McCabe Closed Following Allegations of Lying to Investigators\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department announced on Friday that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will not face charges following an investigation by the department's inspector general that he lied to investigators about a leak to the media. In a letter to McCabe's attorneys, the department stated, \"based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known to the government at this time, we consider the matter closed.\"\n\nThe decision is unlikely to be welcomed by President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized McCabe online and in public remarks. McCabe has long been a target of Republican leaders who allege political bias within the FBI. McCabe's wife ran for the state legislature in Virginia as a Democrat, prompting early attacks that he might be going easy on Hillary Clinton. Later, McCabe was fired after investigators concluded he lacked candor about an episode involving the release of information to a reporter. He was relieved of duty in March, hours before he was set to retire.\n\nMcCabe has maintained his innocence and has called himself the victim of political vengeance. In a statement on Friday, McCabe's lawyers said, \"At long last, justice has been done in this matter.\" They added, \"We said at the outset of the criminal investigation, almost two years ago, that if the facts and the law determined the result, no charges would be brought.\" The lawyers continued, \"We are pleased that Andrew McCabe and his family can go on with their lives without this cloud hanging over them.\"\n\nThe allegations against McCabe stemmed from a Justice Department Office of Inspector General's report, which found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" when he told investigators that he did not know who authorized an aide to talk to the Wall Street Journal about the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe Justice Department's decision not to pursue charges against McCabe comes a day after Attorney General William Barr publicly criticized Trump, saying his tweets \"make it impossible for me to do my job.\" McCabe has sued the Justice Department, alleging that his March 2018 firing by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions was a politically motivated act of retribution by Trump and \"unlawful.\"",
    " Title: Virginia Democrats Face Political Quandary as Three Top Officials Accused of Misconduct\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, a political quandary has arisen in Virginia as three top officials, including Governor Ralph Northam, Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, and Attorney General Mark Herring, face allegations of misconduct. The situation is particularly challenging for the Democratic party due to the historical presence of black and female candidates in the race.\n\nState Senator J. Chapman Petersen, a white Democrat, commented on the potential optics of the situation, stating, \"To show a firm grasp of the obvious, the optics would be difficult and the substance would be difficult.\"\n\nThe Democrats' recent political successes, such as their 40-seat win in the House midterm elections in November and their 2017 triumph in the top Virginia races, have been significantly influenced by women and African-American voters. With Republicans barely holding onto their legislative majority in the Virginia Capitol, these two blocs are crucial for the Democrats' victory in the upcoming election of all 140 delegates and state senators.\n\nGiven the current situation, some Democrats are turning to their most loyal constituency: black women.\n\nShortly after Vanessa T. Carroll, a Duke University alumna, accused Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault in 2000, several senior Virginia Democrats began advocating for State Senator Jennifer McClellan to replace Fairfax if he resigns or is impeached. However, it is unclear whether Governor Northam could appoint any successor to Fairfax due to conflicting provisions and interpretations of the Virginia Constitution and state law.\n\nSenator McClellan, who is black, is a longtime Richmond legislator with statewide ambitions and a close relationship with Senator Tim Kaine. When asked about McClellan, C. Richard Cranwell, a former state Democratic chairman and legislator, stated, \"Jennifer would make an exceptionally good lieutenant governor.\"",
    " Title: House of Representatives Votes to Protect State Medical Marijuana Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that aligns with recent public opinion surveys, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted early Friday to prohibit the federal government from interfering with medical marijuana laws passed by 32 states and the District of Columbia. The vote saw 218 yes votes, with 49 of these coming from actual Republicans.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a former employee of Ronald Reagan, the president who made the \"War on Drugs\" a national priority, was among the leading advocates for the measure. Rohrabacher argued that the strict federal policies, particularly in the case of medical marijuana, were causing more harm than good.\n\n\"Some people are suffering, and if a doctor feels that he needs to prescribe something to alleviate that suffering, it is immoral for this government to get in the way,\" Rohrabacher said. \"The state governments have recognized that a doctor has a right to treat his patient any way he sees fit, and so did our Founding Fathers.\"\n\nHowever, not all Republicans supported this view. Virginia's Frank Wolf, who chairs the House committee that wrote the $50 billion appropriations bill on which the marijuana language was tacked, questioned the legitimacy of medical marijuana. Wolf pointed out that several medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Glaucoma Society, and Glaucoma Research Foundation, among others, opposed medicinal marijuana.\n\nTwo doctors who are also members of Congress, Louisiana Republican Rep. John Fleming and Maryland GOP Rep. Andy Harris, expressed concerns about the impact of marijuana on brain development and the imprecision of marijuana prescriptions, respectively.\n\nIn response, Georgia Republican Rep. Paul Broun countered with his own medical expert, stating that the components in marijuana are useful for some conditions. \"It's actually less dangerous than some narcotics that doctors prescribe all over this country,\" Broun said.\n\nThe vote result surprised even those who had been lobbying for it over the past decade. Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, noted that the proposal had received the most votes previously in the House (165 in 2007).\n\n\"We expected that we'd get close to passing it, and then pass it next year,\" Tvert said. \"But clearly things are moving forward very quickly at the federal level just as they are at the state level. People are fed up with the current state of marijuana laws.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal has only cleared the House, and Rohrabacher and his Democratic co-sponsors acknowledged that they did not have Senate supporters lined up yet to move the language in that chamber. Democratic Rep. Jared Polis, whose state of Colorado allows non-medicinal marijuana, stated that focusing on what happens next in the congressional process misses the larger point.\n\n\"The will of the House is important on this issue,\" Polis said. \"Congress is far from leading the country in this regard. Rather, we're catching up with where the country already is.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Offer Criticism of Biden, Discussions on Buttigieg's Speech Emerge\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape is shifting, with the Democratic party expressing encouragement following recent polling results, while maintaining criticism towards President Joe Biden and offering thoughts on the speeches delivered by candidate Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThe polling data indicates a challenging outlook for President Donald Trump, with his approval rating significantly lower than in the 2016 election in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa - states he won during that election. However, it is important to note that much can change between now and the November 2021 election, and it is true that state-level polls underestimated Trump's support in 2016.\n\nThe head-to-head polling does not provide a clear picture of events 18 months in the future, but it does suggest that there is no counterintuitive process whereby Trump secures the votes of people who disapprove of his presidency. The public, for the most part, expresses a desire to vote for any Democratic candidate, with better-known Democrats performing better than less-known ones.\n\nDemocrats are advised to take a modest amount of reassurance from Trump's poor polling numbers and focus on other issues. The ongoing debate within the party centers around Biden's assertion that if Trump is no longer in office, Republicans in Congress will negotiate with a Democratic president in good faith. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has stated that he will continue to obstruct any legislation from a Democratic president, while promising to further pack the Supreme Court if a vacancy arises during an election year.\n\nBiden and other Democratic candidates are encouraged to run against McConnell and the Trump Republicans in Washington. Some argue that Biden may be attempting to woo Obama-to-Trump voters and upscale white suburbanites who are reportedly dismayed by Trump's behavior. However, there is evidence to suggest that Biden believes he brings unique skills at bipartisanship to the table, having made deals with the Republicans in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nRegarding Buttigieg's speech, opinions are divided. Some view Buttigieg as an heir to Obama's cautious and intellectual worldview, while others see him as a liberal internationalist who aims to bridge the gap between the Obama and Clinton wings of the party. The debate revolves around Buttigieg's ability to articulate his vision and policies effectively, as he seeks to set a generous narrative of national identity against Trump's narrow and uncompromising vision.\n\nIn conclusion, the political landscape is evolving, with the Democratic party offering criticism towards President Biden and discussing the speeches delivered by candidate Pete Buttigieg. The polling data suggests a challenging outlook for President Trump, while the debate within the Democratic party centers around bipartisanship, national identity, and the role of the wealthy in politics.",
    " Title: \"Caution Advised in Interpreting 2020 Presidential Polls Due to Persisting Challenges from 2016\"\n\nArticle:\n\nSeveral Republican officials and pollsters have expressed concerns about the reliability of 2020 presidential election polls, citing the inaccurate polling results from the 2016 election. In a recent report, more than 50 Republican officials interviewed from across the country have expressed optimism for President Donald Trump's re-election prospects, attributing the optimism to unreliable polls, a rebounding economy, and a fading pandemic.\n\nNeil Newhouse, a veteran GOP pollster, stated that there is a \"shy Trump supporter,\" or voters unwilling to disclose their support for President Trump during phone surveys. He believes that this group could account for at least 2 to 3 percentage points in the vote count. The \"shy Trump supporter\" phenomenon was a factor in the flawed polling of the 2016 election, with national polls showing Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by 3 percentage points, but she ultimately won by only 2 points. Election-eve polls in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan also failed to predict Trump's victories in those states, which ultimately decided the Electoral College.\n\nThe Trump campaign has seized on the \"shy voter\" theme, leading to headlines such as \"Trump has a point about the polls.\" The polling community, particularly in battleground states, is still grappling with the same issues they faced in 2016, including shy voters and possibly inadequate consideration of non-college-educated white voters.\n\nCourtney Kennedy, director of research at the Pew Research Center and the lead author of a report on 2016 polling flaws, warned that the fundamental, structural challenges that came to a head in 2016 are still in place in 2020. This warning is significant for both campaigns and voters, as it suggests that if pollsters do not address these issues, both parties must behave as if the polling might be off. In other words, when it comes to polls, caveat emptor - buyer beware.",
    " Title: Romney Shifts Strategy, Emphasizes Policy Prescriptions and Foreign Policy in Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, is altering his campaign strategy, focusing on a broader range of issues beyond the economy in response to recent polls showing President Barack Obama leading in crucial swing states. Chief strategist Stuart Stevens revealed this shift in strategy to \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe new strategy, which includes a more comprehensive focus on policy prescriptions, marks a departure from Romney's long-held strategy of emphasizing the struggling economy almost exclusively. However, Stevens emphasized that the economy will remain the dominant focus of the campaign.\n\nThe change in strategy comes as polls indicate Obama gaining ground in states like Ohio, a critical battleground state. Romney advisers concluded that a course correction was necessary to counter this trend.\n\nThe new strategy will see Romney's ads and speeches addressing a wider array of issues, including foreign policy, the threat from China, debt, and the tone in Washington. Stevens stated that the central question of the campaign will be: \"Can we do better on every front?\"\n\nOn Monday, Romney unveiled a new ad, \"The Romney Plan,\" which counters Obama's emphasis on growing the economy for the middle class and outlines Romney's plans. In the ad, Romney says, \"My plan is to help the middle class. Trade has to work for America. That means cracking down on cheaters like China. It means opening up new markets.\"\n\nA second ad, \"Failing American Families,\" released on Monday, is more critical, with a male narrator stating, \"Barack Obama: More spending. More debt. Failing American families.\"\n\nThe new ads represent a concession to internal critics of Romney's previous ad series, the 16 \"A Better Future\" ads, which were customized for nine swing states. Each ad begins with a clip of Romney at the convention, followed by a quick statistic arguing that Obama has failed that particular state, and ending with Romney's plan to help the state (defense in Colorado, home values in Florida, manufacturing in North Carolina).\n\nRomney also plans to emphasize policy solutions when he speaks Monday to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles. In prepared remarks, Romney criticizes Obama for not discussing the unemployed and not unveiling a jobs plan at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nRomney, who is losing the Hispanic vote to Obama, also includes a pitch to improve \"legal immigration.\" He states, \"I will work with Republicans and Democrats to permanently fix our immigration system. I believe we can all agree that what we need are fair and enforceable immigration laws that will stem the flow of illegal immigration, while strengthening legal immigration.\"\n\nStevens argued that Romney is performing better than many pundits recognize, and the Middle East unrest and continuing economic unease will help Romney regain momentum and alleviate concerns among GOP insiders.",
    " Title: Kupperman Lawsuit Halts Testimony in Trump Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nCharles Kupperman, former White House official and top aide to John Bolton, failed to appear for a scheduled deposition with House investigators on Monday as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Kupperman filed a lawsuit on Friday, seeking a court ruling on whether he should comply with the House subpoena to testify or comply with a White House order to stay away.\n\nHouse investigators had expected Kupperman to corroborate key elements of a top U.S. diplomat's account that Trump built a shadow foreign policy team around his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate a political rival, and that Trump held up U.S. military aid for Ukraine as leverage.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, rejected Kupperman's move as a ploy to delay his appearance. However, Schiff also stated that House Democrats do not intend to wait for the court ruling and are prepared to move ahead with their impeachment inquiry.\n\nKupperman's lawyer, Charles Cooper, stated in a Friday statement that his client seeks only to carry out whichever constitutional obligation the Judicial Branch determines to be lawful and binding on him. House investigators called the lawsuit a stall tactic and accused Kupperman of working with the White House to stonewall Congress.\n\nNicholas Rostow, who served as legal adviser to the National Security Council in George W. Bush's White House, expects the congressional subpoena to take precedence over the White House claim, but cautioned that the court may take a different view. Rostow, who has long worked with Bolton and knows Kupperman, said the court may have to wrestle with the question of whether the House has officially voted on the impeachment inquiry, potentially allowing executive privilege to still apply.\n\nPeople who know Kupperman describe him as honest, straightforward, and not swayed by politics or ideology. Former Trump administration officials note that Kupperman is known for following procedures and served various roles in President Reagan's administration, including in the White House and on an advisory committee on arms control. Kupperman worked as an executive at defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed Martin before joining the Trump administration in January. He left the White House on Sept. 20, 10 days after Bolton and Trump parted ways.\n\nKupperman has expressed some controversial hard-line views in his past work with Frank Gaffney, the founder of the Center for Security Policy, who has advocated curtailing immigration and has repeatedly denounced Muslims. However, a former Bush administration official noted that Kupperman was also known to be \"quietly instrumental\" in helping to strengthen and build National Security Council staff during his time in Trump's White House.\n\nKupperman started at the National Security Council two months after Bolton's first deputy, Mira Ricardel, was pushed out of her post following an argument with first lady Melania Trump's office. Despite their political differences, Ross said he never knew Kupperman to be anything but straightforward. \"It'll be the real facts,\" Ross said. \"It won't be something else. It won't be alternative facts.\"",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senator Ted Cruz Engage in Debate over Government Shutdown and Obamacare Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senator Ted Cruz have engaged in a heated debate over the potential government shutdown due to the funding of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Senator Cruz, who has been leading the charge to defund Obamacare, accused Senator Reid of being unwilling to negotiate or compromise on the issue.\n\nCruz stated that Senator Reid's position is that \"100 percent of Obamacare must be funded in all instances, and other than that he's going to shut the government down.\" Cruz also mentioned that early Sunday morning, the House passed a compromise bill, which would delay the implementation of Obamacare for a year, rather than defund it entirely.\n\nSenator Cruz argued that although he believes Obamacare should be repealed, he is currently fighting only to defund it. He stated, \"That's the essence of a compromise.\" In response to criticism from some of his fellow Republicans that his efforts may harm the party if the government is shut down, Cruz compared his stance to that of former Senator Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who in 1993 opposed the Clinton healthcare initiative. Gramm's arguments persuaded other Republicans to oppose what Cruz called \"Hillarycare Lite.\"\n\nSenator Cruz also addressed the argument that the public is not protesting in the streets against the Affordable Care Act. He responded, \"The only people who are not listening to the argument are the career politicians in Washington.\" The article concludes with a call-to-action for readers to visit NBCNews.com for more information.",
    " Title: Democrats Show Flexibility on Revenue Targets in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing negotiations regarding the fiscal cliff, incoming House Democratic Caucus chair Xavier Becerra has indicated a willingness to negotiate on the revenue target, signaling a shift from the party's hardline stance on tax rate increases for top-wage earners and resistance to major entitlement changes.\n\nWhile Democrats continue to advocate for tax rate increases on the wealthy and avoid significant revisions to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, they are not necessarily tied to the multitrillion-dollar revenue target proposed by President Barack Obama, which Republicans deem unrealistic.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Xavier Becerra, the incoming Democratic Caucus chairman, stated, \"So long as you come out with a balanced approach, you could come up with almost any number.\"\n\nThe year-end tax debate has primarily focused on the extent to which Republicans are willing to accept tax increases. House Democrats, who have been largely excluded from talks between House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Obama, could play a significant role if a year-end budget package is negotiated.\n\nDemocrats in the House, who lost the majority in 2010, will likely be called upon to move the package across the finish line to offset potential GOP defections. While most Democrats are unlikely to oppose the White House, the administration is already adjusting its revenue goals.\n\nAfter initially requesting $1.6 trillion in revenue, the administration presented Republicans with a proposal this week that reduced the request to $1.4 trillion. Most Democrats aim for a deal that closely aligns with Obama's opening bid and reject the $800 billion in revenue offered by Republicans as insufficient.\n\nIf lawmakers were to pursue a middle ground between the Republican and Democratic offers, they would find themselves in the vicinity of $1.2 trillion. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) stated that this revenue goal is acceptable.\n\n\"Without me committing Democrats, what I would say is we are open to an idea that is in that range,\" she said.\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means panel, also suggested a deal could be reached at $1.2 trillion, but not lower.\n\n\"The president could come down to $1.2 trillion,\" he said. \"I don't think he'll go any lower if he did.\"\n\nOther Democrats argue there is room for negotiation. In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) has discussed a deal that raises $1 trillion in revenue.\n\n\"There is a lot of middle ground between $1.6 trillion and $800 billion,\" said Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA), who will join the Ways and Means Committee next year.\n\nAnother incoming Ways and Means Democrat, Pennsylvania's Allyson Schwartz, stated, \"Nothing is set in stone.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Distance Themselves from Obama's Policies Amidst High Approval Ratings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2020 Democratic presidential race, several candidates are distancing themselves from former President Barack Obama's policies, despite high approval ratings among Democratic voters. While many voters are searching for a candidate reminiscent of Obama, the candidates argue that Obama's administration failed on immigration, healthcare, and trade.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who once referred to Obama as his \"brother from another mother,\" criticized Obamacare, the trade deal negotiated during the Obama administration, and the high number of deportations during Obama's tenure. When asked if he would continue Obama administration deportation policies, Biden said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nSenators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey also criticized Obama's immigration and healthcare policies, respectively. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized the Obama Justice Department's handling of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, a black man who died in a chokehold by city police during his arrest for selling cigarettes on the street.\n\nIn response, Biden defended the Obama immigration record, citing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) deportation amnesty granted to illegal immigrant \"Dreamers.\" He argued that the number of deportations was not a fair measure of the administration's accomplishments.\n\nDemocratic strategist Zach Friend, who worked on Obama's 2008 campaign, stated that it was a mistake to criticize Obama's legacy, as his popularity among Democrats has been as high as 97% in recent polls. Friend argued that the focus should be on President Trump's current policies rather than criticizing Obama's legacy.\n\nThe Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit NAACP, agreed, stating that the focus should be on Trump \"because his record is destroying the nation and who we are.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez made it clear that Obama's legacy remains popular, stating, \"Am I the only one who misses Barack Obama in this room?\" during the debate.\n\nCriticizing Obama's time in the White House is a risky move for any of the 2020 hopefuls, as they risk alienating the party's voters who romanticize Obama's not-so-long-ago days. It is particularly treacherous for Biden, who is running as Obama's political heir with the promise of restoring the normalcy of the Obama era.\n\nObama voters were irked by the attacks on the former president's policies at the debates. Francois Demonique, a professional chauffeur in Detroit, stated, \"I felt bad seeing Obama's legacy dragged through the mud.\" Demonique, who moved to the U.S. from Liberia more than 30 years ago and got his U.S. citizenship to vote for Obama, was especially distraught that Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts want to replace Obamacare with \"Medicare for All\" government-run health care.\n\nIowa-based Democratic strategist Jeff Link stated that it is smart for Biden to keep Obama close, as the good in the eyes of primary voters far outweighs the bad. Link stated, \"I wouldn't put a lot of distance between [Biden] and President Obama on anything.\" Link also noted that Biden's words against Obama may have been \"in the heat of the moment\" of the debate and that Biden tried to repair any damage afterward.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Party has moved dramatically to the left since Obama was in office. Some of the strongest challengers to Biden, who remains the front-runner, are far-left champions Senators Sanders and Warren. Another powerful contender, Senator Harris, is more moderate but also is embracing parts of the far-left agenda, including a variation of Medicare for All.\n\nAccording to Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, it is an effective strategy for Biden to tap into Obama's popularity with the party's voters. West stated, \"That may well be Biden's best claim to the nomination. However, in the current political environment, it will be hard to defend Obama's record on deportation and trade, as the party has moved well to the left on those issues, and no one is going to accept those policies as the right ones at the current time.\"",
    " Title: Colin Kaepernick's Controversial Protest and Its Impact on American Sports\n\nArticle:\n\nColin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, has been making headlines for his controversial decision to not stand during the national anthem, a move that has sparked both criticism and support. Kaepernick, who is currently not playing due to his limited career success, has been using this controversy to keep his name in the spotlight.\n\nKaepernick's actions have been compared to the marketing strategies of athletes like Dizzy Dean and Muhammad Ali, who were known for their boastful and charismatic personalities. However, unlike Ali, who backed up his claims with exceptional athletic performance, Kaepernick's career has been moderately successful at best.\n\nKaepernick's protest is a response to what he perceives as the oppression of black people and people of color in America. He stated, \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.\" He has vowed to continue his protest until there is \"significant change\" and he feels the flag represents the country as it should.\n\nThe country, as a whole, may not meet Kaepernick's exacting standard, and it is unclear if it ever will. Kaepernick, who is 28, may not recognize himself in 10 years. He was raised by white foster parents, and his relationship with them is not widely known.\n\nThe anthem, originally an English drinking song called \"To Anacreon in Heaven,\" has been the national anthem since 1931, beating out \"America, the Beautiful.\" Angry football fans have resorted to burning Kaepernick's jersey, a move that, ironically, still generates revenue for the athlete due to jersey sales.\n\nThe internet has been ablaze with reactions to Kaepernick's actions, with some taking pride in the unique American right of free speech he is exercising, while others have expressed disdain for his actions. The greater glory of America, as some have pointed out, is the right to peacefully protest, a right that has been protected and preserved by many who have given their lives in service to the country.",
    " Title: First Lady Michelle Obama Urges Fundraising Support for Democrats Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama called upon supporters in Chicago on Thursday to contribute the maximum allowable amount to Democratic campaign committees in an effort to bolster the party's chances in the upcoming midterm elections. The fundraising push comes as President Barack Obama, who has been actively fundraising in recent weeks, concluded a three-day West Coast tour that raised millions of dollars for the committees.\n\nIn her address to donors, Michelle Obama stated, \"We need you to write the biggest, fattest check that you can possibly write.\" She emphasized, \"Writing those checks is the single-most impactful thing that you can do right now.\"\n\nThe midterm elections in November present a challenging landscape for Democrats, with their chances of taking control of the House appearing slim, and Republicans aiming to secure the six Senate seats necessary to take over the chamber.\n\nPresident Obama's approval ratings remain at record lows, which has left many incumbent Democrats hesitant to campaign alongside him. However, the President remains a draw at high-dollar fundraisers, having attended events in New York, Texas, Colorado, Washington state, and California over the past month.\n\nDuring his recent West Coast trip, Obama made stops in Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, including a star-studded event at the home of \"Scandal\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" creator Shonda Rhimes.\n\nIn addition to official Democratic committees, Obama has also appeared at several events for two Democratic super PACs, despite his past opposition to outside groups with unlimited fundraising potential. These events, while not officially labeled as fundraisers, do not have official price tags, and organizers claim they are not fundraisers.\n\nAlthough Obama does not explicitly ask for funds during these super PAC events, attendees are generally understood to be high-dollar donors who write substantial checks before departing. There is no limit to the size of contributions to super PACs. Neither the White House nor the organizations themselves have disclosed the attendees at the four events Obama has attended for the groups.\n\nIn her fundraising pitch on Thursday, Michelle Obama acknowledged \"there's too much money in politics,\" but argued that Democrats could not afford to trail behind Republicans in that area. \"We can't just stake out the moral high ground and feel good about ourselves\u2014we need to act,\" she said.\n\nDuring her remarks, Obama expressed continued faith in her husband's ability to bring about positive change, a campaign slogan from 2008 that Vice President Joe Biden seemed to suggest had not yet materialized last week. \"When folks ask me whether I still believe everything we said about hope and change back in 2008, I tell them that I believe it more strongly than ever before,\" she said. \"While we still have plenty of work to do, we have truly made so much of that change we've been talking about.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Opposition to NSA Phone Data Collection Program\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Representative Justin Amash (R-Michigan), has introduced a measure to end the National Security Agency's (NSA) bulk collection of phone records. The push for the measure has found an unexpected ally in Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wisconsin), one of the principal authors of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n\nSensenbrenner, in a statement, expressed his opposition to the program, stating, \"The time has come to stop it.\" The program, he argued, was not in line with his original intent when authoring the PATRIOT Act.\n\nOpposing this measure are not only President Barack Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, but also leaders of the nation's defense and intelligence establishment. On Tuesday, the director of the NSA, General Keith Alexander, provided classified briefings to lawmakers regarding the program, and the White House issued a statement urging lawmakers not to approve the measure.\n\nOn Wednesday, James L. Jones, the retired Marine Corps general who was President Obama's national security adviser from 2009-10, added his name to an open letter in support of preserving the NSA programs. The letter, signed by more than half a dozen top national-security officials from the Bush administration, stated, \"Denying the NSA such access to data will leave the nation at risk.\"\n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers (R-Michigan), a supporter of the NSA program, took a personal swipe at Representative Amash, stating, \"This is not a game, this is real. It will have real consequences.\"\n\nDespite these overtures, many rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats appear impervious to such arguments. Representative Jared Polis (D-Colorado) and a supporter of the amendment, stated that if the Obama administration felt strongly about defending the program, President Obama would have spoken out personally. Instead, the White House released a statement under the name of the press secretary, Jay Carney.\n\n\"The press secretary says hundreds of things every day,\" Mr. Polis said.\n\nThe divisions in Congress seem to reflect the ambivalence in the nation. In a CBS News poll released Wednesday, 67 percent of Americans said the government's collection of phone records was a violation of privacy. At the same time, 52 percent called it a necessary tool to help find terrorists.",
    " Title: Clinton's Personal Fundraising for Super PAC Sparks Controversy Among Progressive Critics\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton's decision to personally raise funds for a super PAC supporting her presidential campaign has sparked criticism from progressive Democrats, who view the move as a contradiction to her populist rhetoric. The former Secretary of State's involvement with Priorities USA, a super PAC, has highlighted the contrast between her and her only declared rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, as well as other potential Democratic candidates.\n\nClinton's campaign has explained the decision as a matter of political necessity, citing the need for resources to compete against Republican candidates and their reported reliance on super PACs. However, the move has been met with criticism from progressive activists who find the prominent role of super PACs in elections distasteful.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has aggressively opposed super PAC donations. As a long-shot candidate without a national fundraising operation, Sanders has no chance of matching Clinton's fundraising haul and has little to lose by going after millionaire and billionaire donors.\n\nThe development has also exposed a core tension for Democrats, who have increasingly embraced super PACs at the same time that they decry the explosion of soft money in national politics. Critics argue that Clinton's personal involvement with Priorities USA underscores a perceived disconnect between Clinton and middle-class voters.\n\nPhil Noble, a South Carolina Democratic activist and supporter of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a potential Democratic candidate for president, said the development underscores what progressives view as a \"fundamental disconnect\" between Clinton and middle-class voters.\n\nActivists who are pushing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton see campaign finance reform as a major issue. \"Being a true champion for working families like Elizabeth Warren is about clearly and unequivocally supporting such critical priorities as a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United,\" said Erica Sagrans, campaign manager for Ready for Warren, a movement dedicated to drafting Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 race.\n\nThe 2016 money race is well underway on the other side of the political aisle. Declared GOP candidates including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as expected candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, are on a fundraising tear. They have shown no signs of distancing themselves from super PAC money.\n\nSome progressive leaders argue that the stiff competition against Republican money is a reality that cannot be ignored. Former Vermont governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said it would be unwise for Clinton to reject super PAC money. \"Unfortunately, if you don't play by the same rules everybody else does, you end up losing elections,\" said Dean, founder of Democracy for America, one of the groups behind the draft Warren movement. \"The key is to change the rules, and I think we have a much better chance of doing that with her as president than we do with one of the Republicans.\"",
    " Title: Mueller's Office Disputes BuzzFeed News Report on Trump and Cohen\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare public statement, special counsel Robert Mueller's office on Friday disputed a report from BuzzFeed News that alleged President Donald Trump directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie in his testimony before Congress. The BuzzFeed report, which received worldwide coverage and intense interest, claimed that Trump instructed Cohen to lie about the Trump Organization's pursuit of a deal to build a luxury residential high-rise in Moscow, hoping to conceal these actions during his presidential bid.\n\nMueller's office, which has remained mostly quiet on reports regarding the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, took the rare step of calling BuzzFeed's story \"not accurate.\" Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller's office, stated, \"BuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate.\"\n\nThe BuzzFeed report also asserted that Mueller's office knew of the president's alleged actions after obtaining information through internal emails, text messages, and multiple interviews. The report revived discussions about the possibility of impeaching Trump and emboldened House Democrats who vowed to investigate the allegations.\n\nWhile Mueller's office disputed how BuzzFeed characterized statements, documents, and testimony in its story, the statement did not include specifics or a sweeping denial of the story's overall theme: that the president directed Cohen to lie to Congress. BuzzFeed responded Friday, saying the news organization remained \"confident in the accuracy of our report.\"\n\nThe news organization's Editor-In-Chief, Ben Smith, asked that Mueller's office be more clear as to what was inaccurate in the story. \"In response to the statement tonight from the Special Counsel's spokesman: We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he's disputing,\" Smith said on Twitter.\n\nThe president, who frequently calls the media \"fake news,\" lashed out about the report and Cohen's credibility. \"Lying to reduce his jail time!\" the president wrote on Twitter. Michael Cohen, 52, is expected to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to federal financial crimes, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress, which was at the heart of the BuzzFeed story.\n\nCohen admitted he was not truthful when he told the Senate and House Intelligence Committees that all discussions about a Moscow development had ceased in January 2016, knowing that such efforts had continued through at least June \u2013 in the heat of the campaign and as Trump repeatedly denied any links to Russia. Prosecutors have asserted in court documents filed late last year that the tower project \"likely required the assistance of the Russian government.\" The court documents did not address whether Cohen's false statements about the Moscow tower discussions were prompted by any other consideration than an attempt to personally shield the campaign from public association with Russia.",

The request comes amid controversy surrounding the summit, with questions arising over the details of the private conversation between the two leaders.\n\nAt their first bilateral summit, held in Helsinki on Monday, the two presidents met privately for two hours with only their interpreters present. Despite ongoing investigations into alleged Russian state interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Mr. Trump proceeded with the meeting.\n\nConfusion over Mr. Trump's position took another turn when he appeared to reject suggestions that Russia might try again to influence American elections, prompting a hasty denial by the White House. Democrats argue that, as the only other American official present in the room, Ms. Gross can and should provide details of what the two presidents said to each other.\n\nSenator Menendez stated, \"We want the interpreter to come before the committee. We want to see the notes. We're going to have a massive effort to try to get to what happened.\" Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell added, \"Congress and the American public deserve to know the details of their private conversation.\"\n\nIf Ms. Gross declined to appear before the committee, she should be subpoenaed, he wrote. \"We need public testimony by the only American present at this meeting to ensure Trump did not further undermine our intelligence or law enforcement communities,\" he said.\n\nInterpreters are typically meant to be all but invisible at summits, and Ms. Gross is a U.S. State Department employee with years of experience translating at the highest level, according to CNN. However, Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed reservations about the idea.\n\n\"They're not policy people,\" he told reporters. \"They are in some cases contract folks. In the future, would any notes even be allowed to be taken if you started doing this kind of thing?\" He also pointed out that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Helsinki with Mr. Trump, would be questioned by the committee next week.\n\nIn Russia, Konstantin Kosachev, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, said the idea of questioning an interpreter set a dangerous precedent that threatened the \"whole idea of diplomacy.\" The Associated Press reports this view.\n\nGamal Helal, an Arabic interpreter and senior adviser to four U.S. presidents and seven secretaries of state, told CNN he could not remember such a situation. \"It would be a horrible precedent if a president was not free to talk one-on-one with a head of state... If he [Mr. Trump] spoke in English, there would be no other way for Congress to know what he said, except to ask the president himself. Or Putin.\"\n\nWhile the summit was held behind closed doors, the two leaders gave a news conference afterwards at which Mr. Trump shocked many by defending Russia over the allegations of election interference. Contradicting his own intelligence agencies, he said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote. A day later, Mr. Trump came out to say he had \"misspoken\" and did actually accept U.S. intelligence agencies' findings that Russia had interfered.\n\nHowever, a new row developed when the U.S. leader appeared to disagree with U.S. intelligence over whether Russia was still targeting American elections. Investigations into the alleged interference, denied by Russia, continue, and last week, the U.S. justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in 2016.",
    " Title: Democratic Representatives Boycott State of the Union Address Over President Trump's Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida Representative Frederica Wilson has announced her decision to boycott President Trump's State of the Union address, joining a growing list of Democratic lawmakers who have expressed discontent with the President. Wilson's decision stems from President Trump's \"recent racist and incendiary remarks about Haiti and African nations.\"\n\nIn a statement released late Sunday, Wilson stated, \"For the first time since I began serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, I will not be attending the president's State of the Union address.\" She further expressed her belief that the address would be filled with \"innuendo, empty promises, and lies.\"\n\nRepresentatives Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), John Lewis (D-Ga.), and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) have also announced their intention to boycott the event.\n\nRepresentative Waters, in an interview with MSNBC over the weekend, stated, \"Why would I take my time to go and sit and listen to a liar?\" She added, \"Someone who lies in the face of facts, someone who can change their tune day in and day out. What does he have to say that I would be interested in?\"\n\nRepresentative Lewis made his announcement on Friday, citing reports that Trump had referred to some African countries as \"s--tholes\" in a conversation with lawmakers about immigration. Lewis stated, \"I can not in all good conscience be in a room with what he has said about so many Americans.\"\n\nRepresentative Blumenauer had announced his intention to skip the event before Trump's remarks became public, stating that it would be a waste of time and that he would be working at home instead.\n\nIn response to the accusations of racism, President Trump stated, \"I'm not a racist,\" adding, \"I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed.\"\n\nIn addition to the State of the Union boycott, other protests planned by Democrats include Representative Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) wearing black in solidarity with victims of sexual harassment, and inviting victims of sexual assault to attend the President's first State of the Union address.\n\nOther ideas, such as holding mock trials with women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, have been proposed but not yet implemented.\n\nIn 2016, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) skipped former President Barack Obama's last State of the Union address, and three conservative Supreme Court justices - Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Antonin Scalia - were also a no-show. Scalia, who died in 2016, had missed the State of the Union address more than a dozen times and called the event \"a childish spectacle.\"",
    " Title: Florida Senate Rejects Assault Weapons Ban, Advances Bill to Arm Some Teachers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a party-line vote, the Florida Senate rejected a proposal to ban assault weapons and advanced a measure to arm some teachers, following the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history that occurred on February 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The assault weapon ban amendment, attached to a wider bill, was voted down on Saturday, with the final tally being 20-17 against the ban. Two Republicans joined all 15 Senate Democrats in support of the proposal, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nThe full bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, is expected to pass the state Senate on Monday and then move to the Florida House. Following the Senate's rejection of the assault weapon ban, Stoneman Douglas student Jaclyn Corin tweeted, \"This breaks my heart, but we will NOT let this ruin our movement. This is for the kids.\" Fellow classmate David Hogg, who has become one of the school's leading activists on gun safety, tweeted, \"Elections are going to be fun!\"\n\nAn amendment to remove a provision to train and arm some teachers also failed. The bill raises the minimum age to buy a rifle or a shotgun to 21 from 18 and bans the use, sale, or possession of bump stocks, which were used in the October 1 shooting deaths of 58 people in Las Vegas. The device effectively turns semi-automatic weapons into automatics.\n\nThe bill includes $400 million in funding for schools to address mental health issues, the Herald reported. Nikolas Cruz, the accused 19-year-old shooter who was expelled from Stoneman Douglas, had a history of run-ins with the law and school officials. The Broward County school system and sheriff's department have been criticized for not acting on red flags regarding Cruz's mental health problems and potentially violent behavior.",
    " Title: The Role of Politics and Government in Society: A Reflection on the 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe conclusion of the 2016 election serves as a reminder of the significant role politics plays in modern society, and the potential consequences of elevating politics to a central position in our lives. The article suggests that a less politically-centric approach might lead to a more content and self-sufficient society.\n\nThe piece argues that politics, when given undue prominence, attracts individuals with questionable intentions who promise to solve all problems in exchange for votes. These promises, if kept, would eliminate the need for further political engagement, but they are rarely fulfilled. The author uses examples such as the Affordable Care Act, the removal of Confederate battle flags, and Title IX regulations to illustrate this point.\n\nThe article also touches on the tendency of both major political parties to impose their agendas, with Democrats being compared to strict schoolmarms and Republicans to overzealous enforcers of centrally conceived projects. The current obsession with Title IX rules governing sex on college campuses is cited as an example of political types benefiting from drawing up rules and regulations.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of character and personal conduct, suggesting that these aspects were once the foundation of moral law and discourse in civilized societies. The author questions the role of bureaucracy in shaping individual character and calls for a reevaluation of the purpose of politics and government in a democratic society.\n\nThe piece concludes by asserting that the role of a democratic society is to protect the inborn right to a life of freedom, virtue, and contentment, a right that is less familiar to Americans today compared to the past. The author suggests that this right is being undermined by excessive political involvement and calls for a return to a more self-reliant, self-sufficient society.",
    " Title: Kentucky's Affordable Care Act Enrollment: A Double-Edged Sword for Sen. Mitch McConnell\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the closely watched Senate race between Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and his Democratic opponent, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as \"Obamacare,\" has become a significant campaign issue. However, the effectiveness of this strategy may be questionable, as the ACA has been implemented smoothly in Kentucky, and more than 1 in 10 residents are now covered by \"kynect,\" the state-run exchange under the ACA.\n\nAccording to Stephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, the ACA may be a \"wash\" as a political issue in Kentucky. Voters in the state recognize the ACA's flaws, but they also appreciate the assistance it provides, particularly through kynect.\n\nIn 2014, more than 413,400 people were enrolled in kynect by mid-April. Surveys of enrollees show that 75 percent had no health insurance prior to kynect. Moreover, more than half of those signed up are under the age of 35, a significant demographic for this crucial age bracket.\n\nKentucky's popular Democratic governor, Steven Beshear, embraced the ACA's provision to expand Medicaid, health care for the poor. Statewide, about 80 percent of kynect customers are covered by the Medicaid expansion, and the other 20 percent have chosen the exchange's private plans.\n\nIn areas devastated by the recent collapse of the coal industry, such as Hazard, the coverage for the poor is particularly welcome. In the past year, more than 10,000 jobs have been lost in eastern Kentucky, where unemployment now stands at 14.5 percent.\n\nStephen Kelly, a young man with a wife and two sons and a master's degree in Christian ministry, recently moved to Hazard on the promise of a job that then fizzled. After signing up in person for Medicaid under kynect, which he found to be a \"convenient, simple\" process, he underwent a physical and lab tests, which he had not had \"in quite some time.\" This is the first time he has had health insurance.\n\nWhile the ACA is helping him and his family, Mr. Kelly has mixed feelings about the law. While it is helping those who need it, he notes that it is causing insurance costs to skyrocket for those who already had insurance, such as his parents.\n\nThe ambivalence of Kentuckians toward the ACA is reflected in an April poll by The New York Times/Kaiser Family Foundation. People don't like the health-care law, but they don't want to scrap it either. A majority \u2013 55 percent \u2013 disapprove of the health-care law. However, a majority also say their representative in Congress should work to improve the law, not repeal it and replace it with something else.\n\nThis ambivalence is also seen in other states with hotly contested Senate seats, such as Louisiana and North Carolina. In Arkansas, another state with a close Senate race, a plurality \u2013 48 percent \u2013 want Congress to fix, rather than repeal, the ACA.\n\nSen. McConnell's Democratic opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who favors the keep-and-fix approach, has avoided discussing the health-care law. Her supporters call kynect \"Beshearcare,\" after the governor.\n\nState Sen. Robert Stivers (R) predicts that people will experience \"sticker shock\" when health insurance enrollment notices go out for the new year, just before the election. If this occurs, Sen. McConnell may benefit from his anti-ACA message. However, until then, the new law \"loses its power as an issue\" due to the ambivalence about it, according to Professor Voss.",
    " Title: Former Vice President Biden's Marijuana Policy Stance and Its Impact on 2020 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent public appearance, a potential 2020 Democratic candidate, speaking as a parent of a middle school student, expressed concerns about the growing market for marijuana sales in middle schools. He stated that in the black market, sellers do not verify the age of buyers, disregarding the need for identification.\n\nThe Democratic candidate who may face the most scrutiny on marijuana policy is former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who, during the 1980s and 90s, was a prominent figure in the \"war on drugs.\" He advocated for laws imposing strict mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, including marijuana possession, leading to an era of mass incarceration with significant economic and social consequences for minorities.\n\nJohn Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution specializing in state and federal marijuana policy, stated that Biden's history on criminal justice issues is his most significant liability in the 2020 primary. Hudak noted that Biden's stance in 1994, while mainstream at the time, is now \"almost offensive\" in the context of current Democratic politics.\n\nIn 1994, Biden supported a law that mandated harsher penalties for crack cocaine compared to powder cocaine, a distinction that disproportionately affected African-Americans and whites. Biden has since acknowledged this law as a \"big mistake.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Biden, who has reportedly told aides he is 95 percent committed to entering the presidential race, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTwo Democratic senators who oppose federal marijuana legalization, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, represent Midwestern battleground states with politics less progressive than the coastal states that have led the way in legalizing cannabis for adult use.",
    " Title: ASEAN Foreign Ministers Express Concern Over South China Sea Tensions, Seek Meeting with China\n\nArticle:\n\nForeign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have expressed serious concern over recent developments in the disputed South China Sea region and have agreed to seek a meeting with China to discuss the issue. The concern was voiced at the end of their annual retreat, which took place in the Laotian capital of Vientiane this year.\n\nThe strategically important South China Sea is at the heart of a territorial dispute involving China on one side and several ASEAN countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Tensions have escalated since China began a massive land reclamation program in 2013. Recent satellite imagery suggests that China has installed surface-to-air missiles in a disputed area in the Paracels chain, leading to accusations that Beijing is militarizing the area.\n\nIn a joint statement, the ASEAN foreign ministers expressed their concern over \"recent and ongoing developments\" and took note of the concerns expressed by some members regarding land reclamations and the escalation of activities in the South China Sea. The activities, they said, have \"eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions, and may undermine peace, security, and stability in the region.\"\n\nVietnam's foreign minister, Pham Binh Minh, stated as he left the meeting that he was \"seriously concerned about the situation\" and called for the \"non-militarization\" of the South China Sea. Cambodia's foreign minister, Hor Namhong, said ASEAN would seek a meeting with China over the matter, though no date or venue has been set.\n\nIn addition to the South China Sea issue, other matters were on the agenda. The ministers reiterated their perennial call for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They also addressed Islamic extremism, in the wake of an attack in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta in January that left eight people dead.\n\nMalaysia's foreign minister, Anifah Aman, said, \"The threat is real. It's no longer fictitious or mere imagination.\"\n\nOther topics included ways to bring about ever closer economic cooperation since the advent of the ASEAN Economic Community at the end of last year.",
    " Title: Rowan County Clerk's Absence Leads to Issuance of First Same-Sex Marriage License\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events at the Rowan County Courthouse in Kentucky, a gay couple, James Yates and William Smith, were issued a marriage license after five previous unsuccessful attempts. The event took place on a morning that saw an emotional and contentious scene, with protesters both condemning and cheering the couple as they entered the clerk's office.\n\nThe couple arrived at the courthouse as the sun began to rise, passing by protesters on their way to the clerk's office. The county clerk, Kim Davis, who had previously denied them marriage licenses on five occasions, was in jail due to being held in contempt by a federal judge on Thursday for defying the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage. In her absence, Deputy Clerk Brian Mason handled the couple's application.\n\nYates and Smith became the first same-sex couple to receive a marriage license from Rowan County. After a brief process, Mason congratulated the couple and handed them an envelope.\n\nOutside the courthouse, the couple was greeted with chants of \"Love has won.\" Yates expressed his feelings about Kim Davis' incarceration, stating, \"I don't want her in jail. No one wanted her in jail. We just wanted the licenses given out.\" He further added, \"This is not a blessing. It's an official license.\"\n\nYates' sentiments were that civil rights should not be subject to personal beliefs. \"This means, at least for this area, civil rights are civil rights and they're not subject to beliefs,\" he said.\n\nKim Davis' husband, Joe Davis, was also present outside the courthouse with a group of protesters who considered this a moral fight. Joe Davis stated, \"We don't hate these people. That's the furthest thing from our hearts. We do not hate nobody. We just want to have the same rights that they have.\" He further added, \"They're saying, 'Hey we're going to make you accept us.' But they don't want to accept our beliefs. But they want us to accept theirs.\"\n\nThere is some question regarding the legality of the marriage licenses issued today, as they do not bear Kim Davis' signature.",
    " Title: Attorney General Jeff Sessions Responds to President Trump's Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare move, Attorney General Jeff Sessions responded to repeated criticism from President Donald Trump by defending his tenure at the Department of Justice (DOJ). Sessions' statement comes after Trump's interview with Fox and Friends host Ainsley Earhardt, in which the President criticized Sessions for not taking control of the DOJ.\n\nSessions' statement emphasized the department's success in enforcing the President's agenda, reducing violent crime, and promoting economic growth, among other achievements. He also reiterated his commitment to upholding the rule of law and maintaining the highest standards within the DOJ.\n\nThe President's criticism of Sessions in the Fox interview was not limited to his perceived lack of control over the DOJ. Trump also suggested that Sessions should have informed him of his intention to recuse himself from the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and that he only appointed Sessions due to his loyalty. In a personal attack, Trump questioned Sessions' masculinity and ethics.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has publicly criticized Sessions, but it is the first time Sessions has directly responded to such attacks. In February, Sessions responded to Trump's tweets about the Inspector General's investigation into potentially massive FISA abuse, stating that he had initiated the appropriate process to address complaints against the DOJ.\n\nSessions' latest statement seems to be a response to Trump's recent frustration over the conviction of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the plea deal of former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, both of which are outcomes of the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. Trump has expressed his belief that the investigation is illegal and that Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russian interference investigation is the root of his political problems.\n\nHowever, most legal experts view Sessions' recusal as the right decision, given his role as a prominent surrogate for Trump during the 2016 campaign and his failure to disclose several interactions with Russians during his confirmation hearings. Despite Trump's criticism, he has not fired Sessions, with Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani stating in late May that Trump has no intention of doing so before the Mueller investigation concludes.\n\nWith Sessions' statement, it appears he is challenging Trump to fire him, seemingly unwilling to be bullied into resigning or being forced out of his post.",
    " Title: President Obama Promotes Infrastructure Investment Plan in Miami\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the port of Miami on Friday, President Barack Obama advocated for his \"Rebuild America Partnership\" plan, which aims to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure to stimulate job creation and economic growth in the United States.\n\n\"There are few more important things we can do to create jobs right now and strengthen our economy over the long haul than rebuilding the infrastructure that powers our businesses and our economy - our roads, our bridges, our schools, and our ports like this one,\" President Obama said.\n\nThe \"Rebuild America Partnership\" consists of three components: the creation of a $10 billion national infrastructure bank, the establishment of new \"America Fast Forward Bonds\" for infrastructure investment, and the expansion of funding for the TIGER and TIFFIA infrastructure programs.\n\n\"Let's rebuild this country we love. Let's make sure we're staying on the cutting edge. Let's make sure we've always got the best ports. Let's make sure we've got the best airports. Let's make sure we've got the best rail lines. Let's make sure we've got the best roads. Let's make sure we've got the best schools,\" he said. \"We're going to push on this issue each and every day and make sure we get the middle class going again.\"\n\nBefore delivering his speech, the president toured a tunnel project at the port of Miami, which is undergoing a $2 billion renovation funded by government and private money.\n\n\"Breaking ground on more projects like this tunnel that I just saw means more good construction jobs that can't be outsourced,\" Obama said. \"They have to be done right here in America, and they end up getting people good pay and good opportunities to raise their family.\"\n\nAlan Krueger, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, stated that the program will total $21 billion but vowed that it would not increase the deficit. Details of the costs of the program will be outlined in the president's budget, which will be presented on April 10.\n\n\"They will not increase the deficit by a dime because they are paid for in our budget,\" Krueger told reporters aboard Air Force One Friday. The president stood in front of a crane manufactured by a Chinese company called ZPMC during his speech.",
    " Title: Charlotte Police Allege 70% of Arrested Protesters Were Out-of-State Residents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, Todd Walther, spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police, stated to CNN's Erin Burnett that 70% of the arrested protesters had out-of-state identification cards. Walther claimed that the unrest was not caused by local protestors but by outside entities instigating the violence.\n\nAccording to a tweet by OutFrontCNN on September 22, 2016, Walther stated, \"We've got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night, I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They're not coming from Charlotte.\"\n\nThis statement comes as a surprise to many, but it may not be entirely unexpected given the events that transpired in Ferguson, Missouri, 18 months prior. In August 2014, the riots in Fergusion gained national attention, and liberal billionaire George Soros was accused of funding social justice organizations to turn local protests into a national flashpoint.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Times, key players and financial records revealed that Soros had been funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S. for years, contributing $33 million to social justice organizations. However, in 2015, Ken Zimmerman, the director of U.S. programs at Soros' Open Society Foundations (OSF), denied that Soros had funded Black Lives Matter (BLM), stating it was just a rumor.\n\nThis changed when hackers with DCLeaks.com published OSF documents showing that the Soros group had already given at least $650,000 directly to BLM. The documents revealed that the reason for OSF's bankrolling of BLM was to \"dismantle\" America and recast it according to the vision of Soros and his leftist cohorts. The communist-on-its-face nature of the demands of the organizations under the BLM umbrella are a clear indicator of the real intent of BLM.\n\nWith Hillary Clinton's poll numbers declining rapidly and a debate looming, some question whether the sudden appearance of \"out-of-state\" protesters in Charlotte could be an attempt to shift the focus from Clinton's email scandal, pay-to-play allegations, foreign policy missteps, and health concerns. George Soros, a significant political donor, has been mercurial in his political contributions. In 2004, he contributed $23.5 million to organizations opposing George W. Bush's reelection effort. In 2008, he donated $2,300 to both Clinton and Barack Obama, and that was it. Soros' Open Society Policy Center, the advocacy arm of his philanthropic network, spent $8.2 million on lobbying Washington in 2015. Since 2003, Soros has contributed $54 million to federal candidates and committees.",
    " Title: Campaigns Focus on Foreign Policy Amid Middle East Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from their previous focus on the economy, the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have engaged in a second day of forceful foreign policy debate following attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts in Cairo and Benghazi, Libya.\n\nAt a rally in a northern Virginia suburb of Washington, Romney expressed condolences for the families of American diplomatic workers who died in the Benghazi attack, including Chris Stevens, the American ambassador to Libya. However, he quickly turned to a critical assessment of President Obama's foreign policy strategy.\n\n\"As we watch the world today, sometimes it seems that we're at the mercy of events instead of shaping events, and a strong America is essential to shape events,\" Romney said.\n\nObama, also campaigning Thursday, did not mention Romney's criticisms but issued a warning to the perpetrators of Tuesday's killings.\n\n\"I want all of you to know that we are going to bring those who killed our fellow Americans to justice,\" Obama said to applause at a campaign stop in Colorado. \"I want people around the world to hear me, to all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished.\"\n\nThe aggressive stance from Obama was a contrast to the image Romney began painting of the president late Tuesday, when his campaign issued a statement calling the Obama administration's response to an assault on the U.S. embassy in Cairo \"disgraceful.\" That statement came before news broke that America's ambassador to Libya had died in an attack on a consulate in Benghazi.\n\nOn Wednesday, Romney continued his approach, saying Obama had \"demonstrated a lack of clarity as to a foreign policy.\"\n\n\"I think it is a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values,\" Romney also said. \"That instead when our grounds are being attacked and being breached that the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation. And apology for America's values is never the right course.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Romney again accused the Obama administration of sympathizing with the instigators of the violence in Cairo, citing a statement released by the American embassy there stating it \"condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.\"\n\nA timeline of events Tuesday suggests Romney was mistaken in that allegation, since the violence came after the first statement was published. A later tweet from the embassy, which was subsequently deleted, indicated the embassy was standing by their original statement and also condemning the protests.\n\nReaction to Romney's sharply negative tack has been mixed. Obama, along with other Democrats, pushed back, saying Romney was injecting politics during a time of still-developing international crisis. Like Romney, Obama did not mince words about his political opponent.\n\n\"Gov. Romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later,\" Obama said during an interview with CBS. \"As president, one of the things I've learned is you can't do that. It's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts and that you've thought through the ramifications before you make them.\"\n\nFormer Ambassador Nick Burns, who served in the administrations of former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said he was \"dismayed\" by Romney's choice to inject politics into what he said was a \"very difficult situation\" for the United States.\n\n\"I think it's time for Americans to stand together and I hope Gov. Romney would stand with the administration,\" Burns said, also on CNN.\n\nRepublicans have largely refrained from criticizing their party's nominee, at least publicly. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee and the ranking Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, would not support or chastise Romney's stance on CNN Thursday morning, saying only that he agreed Obama's policy toward the Middle East was weak.\n\n\"Now the tick tock back and forth is something, frankly, I didn't pay attention to,\" McCain said on \"Starting Point.\"\n\n\"I do know this. Americans are outraged when our embassy is attacked and the Egyptian government does not take the proper measures to protect it,\" McCain continued. \"How much that affects our relationship with Egypt, I think, is something we have to carefully calibrate, recognizing how important a role Egypt is in the entire Middle East.\"\n\nOther conservative voices, including the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, also attempted to shield Romney from critics.\n\n\"As Tuesday's events showed, pandering to Islamists who would use the video to inflame anti-American sentiment is not going to stop the protests,\" read the editorial, which was published under the headline \"Romney Offends the Pundits.\"\n\n\"His political faux pas (sic) was to offend a pundit class that wants to cede the foreign policy debate to Mr. Obama without thinking seriously about the trouble for America that is building in the world,\" it continued.\n\nThis week's deviation to foreign policy comes after more than a year of a near-singular campaign focus on jobs and the economy. The topic re-entered the political discussion following the Republican National Convention at the end of August, when Democrats piled on Romney for not mentioning Afghanistan in his speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nLater, during their own convention, Democrats highlighted support for American troops currently in war zones and the president's successful foreign policy actions, including the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. This particular thread was viewed by many as successfully positioning Obama ahead of Romney on an issue that Democrats have traditionally not seen as a strength.\n\nVoters consistently say in polls Obama would better handle America's relationships with other countries if re-elected. In the latest CNN/ORC International survey released earlier this week, Obama had a 54% - 42% advantage over Romney on foreign policy.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's History of Controversial Statements and Allegations of Dishonesty Resurface Amid Health Scare\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton's recent health scare, captured on video, has reignited discussions about her honesty and trustworthiness, a concern that has been a recurring theme in her political career. The Democratic presidential nominee has faced numerous allegations of deceit and dishonesty throughout her political career, dating back to the early 1990s.\n\nOne of Clinton's earliest controversies involved her defense of her husband, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton, during a 1992 interview on \"60 Minutes.\" In the interview, Clinton famously defended herself against accusations of her husband's extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers, stating, \"I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette... I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him.\"\n\nClinton's credibility was further questioned during the White House Travel Office scandal in 1993, when she was accused of orchestrating the firings of employees to make room for friends of the Clintons. The independent counsel investigating the scandal, known as Travelgate, found that Clinton's statements denying her involvement were \"factually inaccurate.\"\n\nIn 2015, FBI Director James B. Comey outlined numerous lies Clinton told the public about her private email server as secretary of state, including misrepresenting the number of devices she used, the classification of emails, and the number of emails she turned over to the State Department.\n\nClinton has also been accused of misrepresenting her foreign policy credentials, such as her claim of \"landing under sniper fire\" in Bosnia in 1996, which was disproven by video footage. Clinton has also been criticized for changing her positions on various political issues, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, the Keystone XL pipeline, same-sex marriage, the Cuba embargo, charter schools, and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.\n\nSome of Clinton's alleged misstatements have been minor, such as claiming that \"all my grandparents\" were immigrants, when only one of her grandparents was an immigrant. Clinton also claimed that she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, one of the first men to climb Mount Everest, but Sir Hillary did not accomplish this feat until after Clinton was six years old.\n\nClinton has also been criticized for her role in the 2012 Benghazi attack, where she has been accused of misrepresenting the cause of the attack to the families of the victims. Clinton has repeatedly denied discussing the cause of the attack with the families, but relatives of three of the victims have claimed otherwise.\n\nIn response to the health scare, Republican strategist Ed Rollins traced Clinton's problem with veracity back to her 1992 \"60 Minutes\" interview. \"It was just a combination of Whitewater, the impeachment, the whole bit. You kind of forgot all that and then basically Benghazi, the emails, that kind of raised it all again,\" Rollins said on Fox News. \"You've got a candidate who has got a 60 [percent] or 70 percent disapproval rating, and people don't think she's honest. And then there's something like this [health episode]\u2014it has an impact.\"",
    " Title: Rising Car Loan Delinquencies Pose Challenge for America's Working Poor\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 7 million Americans are currently 90 or more days behind on their car loans, according to the New York Federal Reserve. This issue disproportionately affects borrowers with the lowest credit scores, whose delinquency rates have seen the fastest acceleration.\n\nThe roots of this problem can be traced back to the 2008 financial crisis, when automakers significantly reduced production in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. A decade later, this has made used 10-year-old vehicles, typically more affordable for low-wage earners, a relative rarity.\n\nAccording to data provided to [\u2588\u2588\u2588] by industry consultant and car shopping website Edmunds, the average price of that vintage of vehicle is $8,657, still nearly 75% higher than in 2010 despite some softening in prices over the last year. In contrast, the average new car has seen a price rise of 25% in that same time period.\n\n\"This is pinching people at the worst point possible,\" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' senior manager of industry analysis. \"If you need basic A to B transportation, you have to get an older car that needs more repairs and has more wear-and-tear issues.\"\n\nMonthly auto payments for Americans making under $40,000 have remained flat since 2017, while those in higher wage brackets have seen their payments rise, according to a Cox Automotive Inc analysis for [\u2588\u2588\u2588].\n\nThis might seem like good news, but to Cox chief economist Jonathan Smoke, it indicates poorer Americans are stretched so thin they can not afford to pay more.\n\n\"They just don't have any flexibility to increase their payment,\" Smoke said.\n\nWeak lending standards in recent years are partly to blame for the rising delinquency rates, which Warren Kornfeld, a senior vice president on Moody's financial institutions team, said are approaching record highs despite a solid economy. Auto lenders are belatedly tightening lending standards, but it may already be too late, he said.\n\n\"The economy is masking the true performance of auto loans,\" Kornfeld said. \"If we hit a downturn today, the performance of auto loans would not look very good.\"\n\nResearch from the New York Fed earlier this year showed that while delinquency rates among borrowers with high credit scores have remained steady and low, for subprime borrowers they have been rising, pushing up the overall delinquency rate. Around 8% of loans originated by lower-score buyers with a credit score below 620 were categorized as seriously late, \"a development that is surprising during a strong economy and labor market,\" Fed researchers wrote.\n\nFor many Americans, a car means job access. Hollis Heyward, a 30-year-old father of two making $10 an hour working at a warehouse in Freeport, Illinois, is one such individual. In the midst of a divorce, all he could afford was a gray 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix with close to 200,000 miles on it, which he bought for $1,300 cash - a fraction of the average new car price.\n\nSuddenly also stuck paying off the loan on his future ex-wife's car, Heyward had to rework the loan with local used-car dealer Gordy Tormohlen of Good People Automotive. Under his \"workout\" deal, Heyward is paying the loan's principal only, and Tormohlen has waived the interest payments. Heyward's monthly payment is now around $120 per month, down from around $350 before the workout.\n\n\"Right now, it's hard to make ends meet,\" said Heyward. \"But I am not the kind of guy to walk away from my commitments.\"\n\nTormohlen, 59, a second-generation dealer, said his business is up 10% this year as auto finance companies tighten lending standards. He said the market feels like it did before the financial crisis hit in 2008, when consumers were over-extended with debt.\n\n\"Americans have grown too comfortable with debt, and the time has come to pay the piper,\" he said.\n\nTormohlen is a \"Buy Here, Pay Here\" dealer, offering subprime loans that he finances himself at 19%, which is higher than a bank but lower than many finance companies. He said he can work directly with struggling customers like Heyward, whom he has known for a decade, but worries that large finance companies with tens or hundreds of thousands of borrowers will be in deep trouble when a downturn hits.\n\nIndeed, according to the New York Fed, more than 1 million more Americans are behind on their car loans now than at the peak of delinquencies in 2010 after the financial crisis.\n\n\"The big lenders who do not know their customers are going to have a problem when the economy turns,\" Tormohlen says.\n\nExpensive older used cars are exacerbating the problem, and it may take years for them to return to more affordable levels. George Augustaitis, director of automotive industry analytics at CarGurus Inc (CARG.O), an online marketplace for new and used cars, said late this spring his team started to notice an \"accelerating decline\" in the number of available vehicles under $10,000, which typically would include vehicles between eight and 12 years old.\n\nIn an analysis for [\u2588\u2588\u2588], CarGuru's data shows a falling share of inventory of Great Recession-era cars, while the number of online \"leads\" from consumers seeking those vehicles has remained steady. In fact, the average American car is the oldest on record, and CarGurus' Augustaitis said the available inventory of vehicles costing under $10,000 will not return to more normal levels until 2022, reflecting rising car production after the Great Recession.\n\nKen Shilson, president of the National Alliance of Buy Here, Pay Here Dealers (NABD), said American consumers have become too comfortable with debt, and subprime customers have been \"poisoned\" by easy access to capital for much of the long economic expansion. But he added that those customers will be forced by tighter underwriting to seek even older vehicles.\n\n\"The American way is to always live beyond your means, and Americans aren't good at making life adjustments,\" Shilson said. \"But there's a reality check coming, and many subprime buyers will be forced to find more affordable transportation.\"",
    " Title: Unemployment Rate Drops to 7.8 Percent; 114,000 Jobs Added to Payrolls\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States unemployment rate decreased to 7.8 percent in September from 8.1 percent in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Despite a relatively weak job growth of 114,000 jobs added to private and public payrolls, the decline in the jobless rate is partly attributed to an increase in the number of Americans who found part-time jobs.\n\nThis report marks the first time since President Obama took office in January 2009 that the unemployment rate is officially below 8 percent. With jobs and the economy being top concerns for voters, the report is expected to be a significant topic during the ongoing political campaign.\n\nAt a campaign event in Fairfax, Virginia, President Obama stated, \"Today's report is a reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now.\" He acknowledged that \"there are still too many of our friends and neighbors\" looking for work, but emphasized, \"we are moving forward again.\"\n\nBusinesses have reportedly added 5.2 million new jobs over the past 2 1/2 years, according to President Obama. The Labor Department will provide further details and reactions to the report shortly.\n\nIn response to the report, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney stated, \"This is not what a real recovery looks like.\" Romney's campaign also noted that the U.S. has lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since President Obama took office.\n\nThe BLS report is based on two surveys: a household survey and a survey of employers. The sampling error on the business establishment survey is plus or minus 100,000 jobs, while the sampling error on the household survey is plus or minus 280,000 jobs. The unemployment rate is based on the household survey, while the figure on job growth comes from the survey of employers.\n\nThe BLS report also indicates that 86,000 more jobs were created in July and August than initially estimated, bringing the average job growth to 146,000 per month from July through September. Additionally, there were 456,000 fewer people counted as being among the unemployed last month.",
    " Title: Bush's Presidential Campaign: Fundraising and Establishment Support\n\nArticle:\n\nJeb Bush, a potential Republican presidential candidate, is taking a cautious approach, according to Scott Reed, the top political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Reed stated, \"The smart money is taking it slower and waiting to see who runs and how these candidates develop a platform.\"\n\nWith the first primary votes still approximately 10 months away, Bush's team has ample time to adjust their strategy. The Republican party shows no signs of coalescing behind another candidate, indicating a potentially competitive primary season.\n\nBush's advisers maintain that he never expected to clear the field, and his refusal to cater to the demands of those whose views he does not share demonstrates a unique approach to the race. Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Bush, stated in an email, \"As Governor Bush considers the possibility of a run, he\u2019s working hard to earn the support of people throughout the party and deliver a positive message about how conservative reforms can restore opportunity and prosperity for more Americans.\"\n\nIn January, Bush's allies began using the phrase \"shock and awe\" to describe his plan to secure a significant portion of the party's major donors and policy experts. The objective was to establish Bush as the sole credible contender for the Republican establishment's endorsement. Bush successfully deterred Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee, from mounting another campaign. However, his organization will not disclose its finances until July.\n\nDespite Bush's efforts to position himself as the Republicans' strongest general election candidate, recent polls show him performing no better against Hillary Rodham Clinton than Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Bush also trails behind Mr. Walker in Iowa, a state known for rejecting candidates perceived as the party's inevitable nominees.\n\nCriticism of Bush comes from both the political establishment and the Tea Party grassroots. Colleen Platt, a City Council member in University Park, Iowa, questioned Bush's motivation for running, stating, \"If he\u2019s going to run for the presidency because his father and his brother were president, is that why we should support him?\"\n\nLingering suspicion of Bush among the Tea Party grassroots stems from his focus on business and philanthropic interests during his career.",
    " Title: Biden Denies Inappropriate Conduct, Promises to Listen to Accusations\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, a prospective 2020 presidential candidate, has issued a statement denying allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct made by Nevada Lieutenant Governor candidate Lucy Flores. Flores accused Biden of planting a kiss on the back of her head during a 2014 campaign event.\n\nIn his statement, Biden stated, \"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support, and comfort. And not once -- never -- did I believe I acted inappropriately.\"\n\nBiden added, \"I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.\"\n\nFlores, in response to Biden's statement, expressed that she is glad he is willing to listen but believes he should acknowledge his actions as wrong. \"I want him to change his behavior and I want him to acknowledge that it was wrong,\" she said.\n\nThe allegations have led to a flood of pictures showing Biden with various women at campaign events and other administration functions surfacing on social media. Vox.com published an article on Friday titled, \"Lucy Flores isn\u2019t alone. Joe Biden\u2019s got a long history of touching women inappropriately,\" which catalogued several alleged episodes of misconduct by the former vice president.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway, speaking on Fox News Sunday, defended Biden, stating, \"Joe Biden has a big problem here, because he calls it affection and handshakes -- his party calls it completely inappropriate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, several other Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls, including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand, are also defending their self-professed commitment to the ideals of the #MeToo movement against a series of accusations they recently mismanaged sexual-misconduct claims against their subordinates. As the three prominent senators each have sought to draw a sharp contrast with President Trump, who has faced his own misconduct allegations, the claims highlighted vulnerabilities that could become major liabilities not only in a heated Democrat Party primary, but also in the general election.",
    " Title: The Importance of Understanding the U.S. Constitution: A Call to Familiarize Ourselves with the Foundational Document\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 4th of July, Independence Day, is a time of celebration and patriotism for Americans, marked by fireworks, parades, and tributes to the Declaration of Independence. In contrast, September 17, Constitution Day, often passes without notice. However, the authors argue that the U.S. Constitution, which outlines the structure of the republic, is crucial to understanding the nation's history and the decisions made by government agencies and the judiciary.\n\nThe longevity of the U.S. Constitution is remarkable, with an average lifespan of written constitutions since 1789 being only 17 years, according to Thomas Ginsburg, Zachary Elkins, and James Melton, authors of \"The Lifespan of Written Constitutions.\" The Constitution's endurance, spanning over two centuries, is a testament to its significance and resilience.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution, at approximately 4,500 words, is not as daunting as some may assume. It can be read in about half an hour. To truly understand it, additional resources, such as the Heritage Foundation's \"The Heritage Guide to the Constitution,\" may be helpful. This guide provides expert analysis of every clause, relevant court cases, interpretations throughout constitutional history, and an overview of the Constitution's creation.\n\nThe guide is used by law schools nationwide and is beneficial for any citizen seeking to understand the law of the land. Whether writing a complex thesis or a simple letter to the editor, the Heritage guide can provide valuable insights.\n\nEdwin Meese III, former U.S. Attorney General, writes in the guide, \"It is our fundamental law because it represents the settled and deliberate will of the people, against which the actions of government officials must be squared.\" The authors emphasize the importance of understanding and adhering to the Constitution for the continued success and viability of the democratic republic.\n\nIn conclusion, the next time September 17 rolls around, it may be worth revisiting the U.S. Constitution, a foundational document that shapes the workings of the American government and the decisions made by its officials. A better understanding of the Constitution can help citizens make informed opinions and ensure the continued success of the democratic republic.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney Hints at Possible Delay of Obamacare Individual Mandate\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney has suggested that the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, could potentially be delayed due to issues with the healthcare law's enrollment website. During a press briefing on Monday, Carney did not explicitly state that the individual mandate would be delayed, but he did indicate that individuals who are unable to enroll in Obamacare due to website issues would not be penalized.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, uninsured Americans are required to sign up for health insurance. If they do not, they could face a fine. When asked if individuals would have to pay a fine if they were unable to enroll in Obamacare due to the glitchy website, Carney did not provide a clear answer.\n\nThis is the first official indication that the president may be considering a delay of the individual mandate. The administration has faced criticism for its handling of the healthcare law's implementation, with many Republicans pushing for a delay for months. The White House has consistently rejected these efforts, insisting that the program would be ready to launch on October 1.\n\nThe administration's own legal positions during the Obamacare Supreme Court case could potentially complicate matters if lawsuits begin to arise. It is unclear at this time whether the president will ask Congress for the delay or impose it unilaterally.\n\nDuring the press briefing, Carney also struggled to provide details about the \"tech surge\" that the administration has announced to repair the website issues. It is unclear who is participating in this \"surge.\"\n\nThe White House's efforts to showcase success stories of individuals enrolling in Obamacare have also faced criticism. During a photo-op on Monday, the White House presented 13 individuals who had supposedly enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. However, it was later revealed that only three of these individuals were actually enrolled in the exchanges.\n\nThe White House has been criticized for its handling of the healthcare law's implementation, with many questioning the accuracy of the success stories presented by the administration. It is unclear at this time whether anyone will be held accountable for the mounting issues with the healthcare law's implementation.",
    " Title: Montana House Candidate Greg Gianforte Charged with Misdemeanor Assault\n\nArticle:\n\nMontana law enforcement officials have charged GOP House candidate Greg Gianforte with misdemeanor assault following an alleged physical altercation with a reporter Wednesday evening, just hours before voters head to the polls. The incident occurred at the candidate's campaign headquarters in Bozeman.\n\nGianforte allegedly assaulted Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian, as he posed questions about the Republicans' ObamaCare repeal plan. In a statement Wednesday night, Gallatin County Sheriff Brian Gootkin stated that Gianforte had been cited for misdemeanor assault.\n\nThe Guardian released an audio recording of the incident, in which Gianforte initially brushes aside Jacobs' question about the new Congressional Budget Office score of the House GOP's American Health Care Act, which passed the House earlier in the month. The nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements of felony assault, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nJacobs was asking about the new Congressional Budget Office score when Gianforte allegedly grabbed him, slammed him to the ground, and broke his glasses. Gianforte's office offered a different account, stating that Jacobs encroached on \"a separate interview in a private office\" and \"aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg's face.\"\n\nEyewitness accounts from several Fox News reporters contradict Gianforte's story. Fox reporter Alicia Acuna stated that Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground. Acuna and others \"watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the man, as he moved on top the reporter and began yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'\"\n\nDemocrats have called on Gianforte to quit the race and for Republicans to condemn his conduct. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee stated, \"Greg Gianforte must immediately withdraw his candidacy after his alleged violent assault of an innocent journalist.\" The committee also launched an 11th-hour Facebook ad campaign highlighting the episode in hopes of swaying voters heading to the polls Thursday.\n\nThursday's special election pits Gianforte against Democrat Rob Quist in a contest to replace former GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke, who is now heading President Trump's Interior Department. Gianforte is seen as a slight favorite in the race.\n\nGianforte is expected to appear in court before June 7. He faces a maximum sentence of six months in jail, a $500 fine, or both. Sheriff Gootkin, a Gianforte supporter, contributed $250 to the Republican candidate in March, but he quickly added that \"this contribution has nothing to do with our investigation which is now complete.\"",
    " Title: Trump Disputes Wall Street Journal's Account of Interview on Relationship with Kim Jong Un\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has disputed a report by the Wall Street Journal that he said he had a \"very good relationship\" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an interview last week. In a series of tweets on Sunday, Trump claimed the newspaper misquoted him, stating that he used a conditional tense, saying \"I'd probably\" have a good relationship with Kim, rather than stating that he did.\n\nThe White House released a portion of the audio from the interview, which it said showed Trump saying \"I'd.\" The Wall Street Journal also released its own audio, claiming it backed up its version of the events.\n\nThe Trump comment is significant as any hint of direct contact between the two leaders, who have exchanged threats and insults, would suggest a major shift in the U.S.-led pressure campaign against Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nTrump has referred to Kim as a \"maniac\" and \"little rocket man,\" while Kim has called Trump a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\" Fears of war have eased somewhat after the first round of intra-Korean talks in more than two years last week, which Trump has welcomed, ahead of February's Winter Olympics hosted by South Korea. North Korea has said it will participate in the Games.\n\nWhen asked what he would do to resolve the North Korea standoff, Trump told reporters in Florida on Sunday, \"We'll see what happens.\" He cited upcoming meetings, possibly a reference to further talks planned between North and South Korea. \"Hopefully it's all gonna work out,\" Trump added. \"We have great talks going on, the Olympics you know about, a lot of things can happen.\"\n\nIn the Wall Street Journal interview, Trump was asked whether he had spoken with the North Korean leader. \"I don't want to comment on it. I'm not saying I have or haven't. I just don't want to comment,\" he had said.\n\nTrump, who is spending a long weekend at his oceanfront Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, tweeted on Sunday, \"Obviously I didn't say that. I said 'I'd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,' a big difference. Fortunately, we now record conversations with reporters... and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!\"\n\nA White House official stated that the delay in publicly disputing the Journal's account was the result of a failed attempt to get the paper to correct the record. \"The reason there was a delay is because we had several calls and emails with WSJ, starting Friday morning, asking them to issue a correction. They refused and so we pushed out our own clarification,\" the official said.",
    " Title: Republican and Democratic Candidates Differ in TV Ad Strategies Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm elections, House Republican candidates are airing a significant number of TV ads emphasizing a hardline stance on immigration, according to an analysis by Kantar Media. This shift in focus is a stark contrast to the midterm elections in 2014.\n\nRepublicans have aired over 14,000 ads this year promoting a Trump-style immigration platform. This trend underscores the concerns of House GOP leaders about the potential risks for Republican candidates if a legislative fix for DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, is passed.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are focusing on ads that promise to protect Obamacare, shore up Social Security, and expand Medicare. One such ad by California Democrat Paul Kerr recounts his family's financial struggles due to medical bills after his mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\nThe competing messages highlight the significant ideological divide between the two parties. They are not just discussing issues differently; they are prioritizing different issues to mobilize activists and win hotly contested primaries.\n\nKyle Kondik, a political analyst with the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, noted that the parties are appealing to different demographics, particularly in primaries. Republicans tend to appeal to a whiter, older, more rural electorate, while Democrats court a more diverse, younger, urban constituency.\n\nThe GOP's focus on immigration is particularly notable, given that it was not among the top 10 issues Republicans spent their ad dollars on at this point in the 2014 midterms. In that cycle, GOP contenders attacked President Obama, bashing the Affordable Care Act and promising to rein in government spending.\n\nNow, immigration ranks second only to pro-Trump spots in GOP campaigns across the country. Brian Murray, a GOP consultant based in Arizona, attributes this shift to the national spotlight immigration received during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn Washington, House GOP leaders are divided over the immigration issue, with moderates pushing for legal status for DREAMers and conservatives advocating for stricter immigration policies and border wall construction. This internal conflict is causing tension within the GOP conference and potentially jeopardizing House Speaker Paul Ryan's grip on power.\n\nSome strategists warn that the GOP's full-throated embrace of Trump's anti-immigration positions in primaries could harm them in the general election, as the majority of Americans support granting permanent legal status to DREAMers and oppose expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic candidates are focusing heavily on health issues in their advertising, running over 26,000 ads on the subject. Of these, more than 8,500 Democratic spots promise to protect or expand Medicare.\n\nIn the primary races, Democratic candidates in some states are taking extreme positions that strategists warn could hurt them in the general election. For example, in Montana's only House seat, Grant Kier, a Democrat, promises to fight Trump on climate change, oppose his health care plan, and protect women's health care choices. These positions, according to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House Republicans, are \"woefully out of touch with Montana values.\"\n\nIn summary, the competing primary ads from both parties demonstrate the significant ideological divide between the two parties, with each focusing on different issues to mobilize their respective bases. The immigration issue is a particularly contentious point of contention, with the majority of Americans supporting legal status for DREAMers and opposing expanded border wall construction.",

Trump and the Trump Organization have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block a subpoena issued by the House Oversight Committee, which seeks financial information from Mazars USA, a longtime accounting firm for the company. The lawsuit, which names House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, is the latest move from Trump's legal team to push back against what one of his attorneys called \"presidential harassment\" from the newly empowered Democratic majority in the House.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday, argues that the subpoena lacks a \"legitimate legislative purpose\" and that it threatens to expose \"confidential information.\" The lawsuit also claims that Democrats are using their newfound majority on congressional committees in the House to investigate \"every aspect\" of Trump's personal finances, businesses, and his family, and that House Democrats are \"singularly obsessed\" with finding politically damaging information on the president.\n\nThe subpoena demands financial statements and supporting documents from Mazars for Trump, the Trump Organization, and other entities, covering documents from 2011 to 2018. In a memo to committee members announcing his intention to issue the subpoena, Mr. Cummings said financial statements provided by Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime former lawyer and fixer, raise \"serious questions\" about Trump's representations of his financial condition.\n\nCohen, who testified to the committee in February about his work for Trump, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, among other crimes. In a separate battle between Trump and congressional Democrats, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal has given the IRS a new April 23 deadline to turn over six years' worth of Trump's personal tax returns, as well as returns for some associated organizations, like one of his golf courses.",
    " Title: Impact of China Tariffs Expected to be Larger and More Concentrated Than Steel and Aluminum Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nThe potential impact of the proposed tariffs on Chinese goods is expected to be larger and more concentrated than the tariffs on steel and aluminum, according to experts. The steel and aluminum tariffs are estimated to affect imports of approximately $33 billion, excluding Canada and Mexico, which are expected to be exempt from the measures, said Joseph Parilla of the Brookings Institution. The proposed tariffs on Chinese goods would affect at least $50 billion in annual imports, according to officials.\n\nChinese companies have been investing heavily in American companies, with new acquisition deals totaling tens of billions of dollars annually, according to Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investments abroad. However, last year, these investments fell sharply to $8.7 billion as China tightened controls on money leaving its borders.\n\nChinese companies have acquired various assets in the United States, including non-strategic assets like movie theaters and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. They have also sought out deals in cutting-edge areas like semiconductors and start-ups related to autonomous driving, as China aims to upgrade its technological capabilities. China views the American stranglehold on fundamental technologies as a long-term economic and security threat to its rise as a superpower.\n\nUnlike the metal tariffs, which caused divisions within the Trump administration and were opposed by many Republican lawmakers and businesspeople, the technology moves against China are likely to be politically popular on Capitol Hill and throughout some industries.\n\n\"Their theft costs us over $350 billion per year, so the bigger the better,\" said Daniel DiMicco, a steel executive and trade adviser to the Trump campaign, referring to the forced transfer of intellectual property and other unfair practices alleged by the administration.\n\nThe business community, which long defended trade with China despite accusations of theft of intellectual property, has grown more dissatisfied with adverse treatment in the Chinese economy. With the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises playing an ever-larger role in the market, the environment for American companies has steadily deteriorated.\n\nHowever, American business groups expressed concern over the possibility that the United States tariffs would spur others around the world to raise their own trade barriers.",
    " Title: Obama's Austin Visit: A Continuation of Economic Agenda Amidst Partisan Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been met with criticism from Republican officials, President Barack Obama visited Austin, Texas, this week, with the visit being described as a campaign-style stunt by the Republican National Committee. The news release from the committee labeled the visit as \"Obama's Jobs Strategy: Pivot Back to the Economy Every So Often.\"\n\nIn his State of the Union address this year, President Obama outlined an economic agenda that included a new emphasis on manufacturing, increased funding for early childhood education, an increase in the minimum wage, and greater investment in infrastructure. While some Republicans have expressed support for parts of this agenda, there is little indication that the bulk of it is headed toward passage anytime soon in a Congress that is increasingly frozen when it comes to fiscal issues.\n\nAides to the president believe that events like the ones in Austin, though likely in service to a lost cause, are necessary to keep pressure on Republicans and to show Americans that President Obama is still pushing for his agenda. The risk for President Obama is that the events can come across as little more than costly excursions that do little to actually improve the economy. However, aides are quick to point out that the president would most likely be criticized if he announced an agenda in the State of the Union address and did not push for it.\n\nDuring his first two years in office, President Obama rarely traveled around the country, staying in Washington to shepherd his health care legislation through Congress. His approval ratings and his mood sank, leading aides to believe that it is important that he travel the country frequently.\n\nIn Austin, President Obama was scheduled to meet with some local residents and technology entrepreneurs, officials said. He was also to tour a facility of Applied Materials, a company based in Silicon Valley that manufactures the complex equipment needed to make silicon chips for computers, phones, and other high-tech machines.",
    " Title: Deadly Riot in Altamira Prison Leaves 57 Inmates Dead, 16 Decapitated\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 At least 57 prisoners were killed by other inmates during clashes between organized crime groups in the Altamira prison in northern Brazil Monday, with 16 of the victims being decapitated, according to prison officials.\n\nThe fight erupted around 7 a.m. between the Rio de Janeiro-based Comando Vermelho and a local criminal group known as Comando Classe A, according to Para state prison authorities. A fire set by the Comando Classe A spread rapidly in the prison, which houses inmates in old container units, preventing police forces from entering the building for several hours.\n\nTwo prison staff members were held hostage but were eventually released. State prisons chief Jarbas Vasconcelos said the incident was a targeted attack, not a protest or rebellion against the prison system.\n\nAuthorities have not found any firearms following the riot, only makeshift knives. Prison authorities said 46 inmates will be transferred to other prisons, with 10 of them going to stricter federal facilities.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected on the promise of curbing widespread violence in Brazil, including in the country's often overcrowded, out-of-control prisons, has not yet commented on the incident.\n\nThe Altamira prison had 343 detainees as of July 2019, according to a report from the National Justice Council, which exceeds the maximum capacity of 163. However, state prisons chief Jarbas Vasconcelos said the situation did not meet the official requirements to be considered overcrowded.\n\nThe judge who filed the report described the overall state of the prison in the city of Altamira as \"terrible.\" In many of Brazil's prisons, badly outnumbered guards struggle to retain power over an ever-growing population of inmates who are able to run criminal activities from behind bars.\n\nThe killings echoed those of 55 inmates who died in a series of riots in May in several prisons in the neighboring state of Amazonas. In early 2017, more than 120 inmates died in prisons across several northern states when rival gangs clashed over control of drug-trafficking routes in the region.\n\nPara state authorities spent the afternoon in Altamira, drafting a security plan to avoid possible retaliations in the region. Police forces from the nearby municipality of Santerem were sent as reinforcement in the coming weeks. Prison authorities said they had not received any prior intelligence reports of an upcoming attack. The prison is run directly by the state, not a third-party private operator as in the Manaus prisons where the riots took place in May. Last year, inmates had already set fire to another wing inside the same prison unit, according to the state prosecutors' office.",
    " Title: Al Gore Expresses Optimism on Climate Change Debate, Citing Shift in Republican Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore, in an interview with The Washington Post, expressed optimism about the future of the climate change debate, stating that activists are \"winning the conversation\" similar to past movements such as civil rights, the nuclear arms race, and the abolition of slavery.\n\nGore compared the current climate change debate to historical movements, stating, \"The same thing happened on apartheid. The same thing happened on the nuclear arms race with the freeze movement. The same thing happened in an earlier era with abolition.\" He further added, \"A few months ago, I saw an article about two gay men standing in line for pizza and some homophobe made an ugly comment about them holding hands and everyone else in line told them to shut up. We're winning that conversation.\"\n\nGore also referenced the debate over smoking, citing the late-Sen. Frank Lautenburg of New Jersey being labeled \"crazy\" for pushing legislation that would ban smoking in airplanes. He stated, \"But he was rewarded politically and then politicians began falling all over themselves to do the same. That's the optimistic scenario. And it's not just a scenario! It's happening now.\"\n\nGore attributed this shift in the climate change debate to a process of \"winning the conversation,\" but noted that this process has been stalled in prior years due to a \"shrinking group of denialists who fly into a rage when it's mentioned.\" He likened this group to an alcoholic father who becomes enraged when certain topics are discussed, leading others to avoid the issue to maintain peace.\n\nHowever, Gore argued that the ability of these \"raging deniers\" to halt progress is diminishing daily. Organizing for Action, a political group formed from President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, recently delivered unicorn statues to Republican climate change deniers in Congress as part of a larger push to \"hold members of Congress accountable for their positions on climate change.\"\n\nGore commended President Obama for his aggressive new climate change strategy, which includes limiting pollution from existing coal-fired power plants and issuing directives requiring the EPA to establish carbon pollution standards for plants that are already active. Gore expressed being \"very encouraged\" by these policy moves.",
    " Title: US Urges Iranian Aid Ship to Divert to Djibouti for UN Oversight\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. officials have called on an Iranian ship, reportedly carrying humanitarian aid to Yemen, to change course and head to Djibouti, where the United Nations is overseeing humanitarian deliveries. The U.S. military is tracking the ship, the Iran Shahed, after Tehran announced plans to send warships to escort the vessel to Yemen.\n\nAccording to the marinetraffic.com site, the ship has moved through the Strait of Hormuz and is currently in the Gulf of Oman. However, the vessel is not under any naval escort at the moment, according to Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren.\n\n\"We are monitoring the Iranian ship,\" Warren said. \"We are aware of the Iranians' statement that they plan to escort this ship with warships.\" The state Iranian IRNA news agency earlier quoted a naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Azad, saying naval forces would be \"safeguarding\" the vessel.\n\nIran's Red Crescent had announced last week that it would send a ship carrying 2,500 tons of humanitarian aid to Yemen, where Tehran-backed Huthi rebels are fighting pro-government forces supported by a Saudi-led coalition.\n\n\"The Iranians have stated that this is humanitarian aid,\" Warren said. \"If that is the case, then we certainly encourage the Iranians to deliver that humanitarian aid to the United Nations humanitarian aid distribution hub, which has been established in Djibouti.\"\n\n\"This will allow the aid to be rapidly and efficiently distributed to those in Yemen who require it,\" he added. When asked if the U.S. military would try to search the ship or prevent it from docking in Yemen, Warren declined to comment.\n\nThe warnings from Washington raised the possibility of a potential confrontation at sea after tensions flared in recent days in the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. Navy bolstered its presence in the Gulf after Iran seized a Marshall Islands-flagged vessel in the vital waterway. Iranian authorities later released the ship, citing a commercial dispute with Denmark's Maersk group, which chartered the vessel.\n\n\"If the Iranians are planning some sort of stunt in the region, they know as well as we do that it would be unhelpful and in fact could potentially threaten the ceasefire (in Yemen) that has been so painstakingly brought about,\" Warren said. \"We call on the Iranians to do the right thing here and deliver their humanitarian aid in accordance with UN protocols which is through the distribution hub that's been established in Djibouti.\"",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Calls for Law Allowing Indictment of Sitting Presidents for Obstruction of Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for Congress to pass a law that makes it clear the Justice Department can criminally indict a sitting president for obstructing justice. In a statement released by her campaign, Warren stated, \"No president is above the law.\"\n\nWarren's call comes in response to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 448-page report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and Mueller's statement this week that Justice Department policy prevented him from bringing charges against a sitting president.\n\nMueller's report concluded that Russia repeatedly interfered in the 2016 election and that Trump's election campaign had multiple contacts with Russian officials, but did not establish a criminal conspiracy with Moscow to win the White House. The report declined to make a judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice, although it outlined 10 instances in which Trump tried to have Mueller fired or otherwise impede the investigation.\n\n\"When the federal government tried to investigate, Donald Trump did everything he could to delay, distract, and otherwise obstruct that investigation,\" Warren's statement said. \"That's a crime. If Donald Trump were anyone other than the president of the United States, he would be in handcuffs and indicted.\"\n\nWarren urged Congress to pass a law making it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice. She also suggested amending statutes relating to such obstruction to allow for indictment when a president abuses the powers of office.\n\nWarren criticized Trump's Attorney General, William Barr, stating he had \"acted like Trump's personal defense attorney.\" She promised that if elected, she would ensure her appointees reverse a Justice Department opinion that argues a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\n\"Donald Trump is not a king. No president is. And our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable,\" Warren concluded.",
    " Title: Court Ruling Reveals NSA Metadata Querying Violations, Criticizes Oversight\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent ruling, Judge Bates recounted that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been routinely running queries of metadata using terms that did not meet the standard for querying. This violation was significant enough to render the requirement for such queries ineffective, according to the 2009 ruling.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a group advocating for free speech and privacy rights, sued to obtain the ruling. The impetus for the lawsuit was Senator Ron Wyden's push last summer to declassify the basic fact that the surveillance court had ruled that the NSA had violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSenator Wyden, an outspoken critic of NSA surveillance, described the declassification of the ruling as \"long overdue.\" He argued that while the NSA had increased privacy protections for purely domestic and unrelated communications that were incidentally collected during the surveillance, the collection itself constituted a serious violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nMark Rumold of the EFF praised the administration for releasing the document with relatively few redactions, although he criticized the time and difficulty in obtaining it. However, he also noted that the ruling demonstrated the surveillance court's inability to provide adequate oversight of the NSA.\n\n\"This opinion illustrates that the way the court is structured now, it cannot serve as an effective check on the NSA because it's wholly dependent on the representations that the NSA makes to it,\" Mr. Rumold said. \"It has no ability to investigate. And it's clear that the NSA's representations have not been entirely candid to the court.\"\n\nA senior intelligence official, speaking to reporters in a conference call, portrayed the ruling as evidence of robust and serious NSA oversight. He stated that approximately 300 NSA employees were assigned to seek out even inadvertent violations of the rules, and the court conducted \"vigorous\" oversight.\n\nThe ruling focused on a program under which the NSA has been searching domestic Internet links for communications\u2014where at least one side is overseas\u2014in which there are \"strong selectors\" indicating insider knowledge of someone who has been targeted for foreign-intelligence collection. An example would be mentioning a person's private email address in the body of an email.",
    " Title: House Republican Leaders Unlikely to Pursue Immigration Bill This Year, Citing Trust Issues with President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nConservative Republicans have expressed doubts about their chamber's intention to address an immigration bill this year, stating that while they welcome the House GOP leaders' principles as a starting point for discussion, it is premature to attempt to pass a bill at this time.\n\nDuring a speech at a Heritage Foundation event, Republican House members expressed reservations about President Obama's commitment to enforcing the stringent security measures that would be included in any potential bill. They emphasized that these security measures must be implemented before any immigration reform could be considered.\n\nRep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican who was part of a group working on a comprehensive immigration bill last year but dropped out, stated that Mr. Obama should spend this year demonstrating his commitment to these security measures before Republicans would consider action in 2015 if they regain control of the Senate.\n\n\"We need to have the trust with this administration, and that trust is not there,\" Mr. Labrador said. \"Until we have that trust, there will be no immigration reform, and it would be a mistake for leadership to push that.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner released principles last week that called for increased security but also for illegal immigrants to be granted legal status, with a specific pathway to citizenship for young adult illegal immigrants, often referred to as the \"Dreamers.\" However, Mr. Boehner himself stated on Tuesday that Republicans have not yet decided whether to move forward with a bill this year.\n\nRep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, noted that while it is not the appropriate time to advance a broad bill, the principles themselves are beneficial for \"beginning a dialogue with the Hispanic community on conservative principles.\"\n\nThe Senate passed a comprehensive bill in June that grants citizenship rights to most illegal immigrants, passing the measure on a bipartisan 68-32 vote. However, even this legislation has faced challenges.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the Senate bill, stated on Tuesday that he does not see a way to align the Senate bill with the House's current discussions.\n\n\"I don't see how you get to an outcome this year with the two bodies in such a different place,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats had hoped the release of the principles would facilitate an agreement this year, but the two sides remain far apart on key issues. House Republicans have insisted on addressing the issue through a series of bills, while the Senate passed a single, comprehensive measure. House Republicans also have insisted on prioritizing border security, while the Senate bill grants quick legal status to most illegal immigrants while simultaneously working to increase manpower and technology at the border.\n\nThe most significant point of contention, however, is the question of citizenship. The Senate bill proposes a new specific pathway that would allow most illegal immigrants to become citizens in about 13 years. House Republicans' principles call for illegal immigrants to receive some form of legal status, but only specify a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants, often referred to as the \"Dreamers,\" who are considered the most sympathetic cases.",
    " Title: Trump's Debut: A Shift in the Republican Presidential Race's Tide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first Republican presidential debate on Thursday night in Cleveland may have left Donald Trump questioning his participation, as he transitioned from the central figure of the campaign to a contender among many.\n\nEntering the debate as the frontrunner, Trump was not only included in the official GOP field but was the focal point, leading in multiple polls of Republicans and Republican-leaners. However, as the two-hour debate progressed, Trump found himself waiting his turn to speak, with several rivals choosing not to engage him to avoid sharing the spotlight.\n\nThe debate began with a challenge to Trump from Fox News' Bret Baier, who asked if anyone onstage was unwilling to commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee in 2016. Trump immediately raised his right hand, causing a mix of boos and cheers from the live crowd. Trump stated that he could not pledge to support the nominee \"if it's not me,\" adding that he would be proud to run as a Republican if the party was good enough to nominate him.\n\nThroughout the debate, Trump tussled with Rand Paul about single-payer health care and wrangled with Jeb Bush about the tone of Trump's own rhetoric. Yet, even at his most outlandish, he could not eclipse the other personalities onstage in the same way he has done all summer.\n\nThe sharpest exchange of the night did not involve Trump. It stemmed from Sen. Rand Paul's speech about his opposition to phone records being gathered by the National Security Agency. The exchange between Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who questioned Paul's ability to differentiate between terrorist and citizen phone numbers, became a platform for both candidates to showcase their political stances.\n\nOther candidates, such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio, and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, also had their moments to shine. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who did not make the cut for the evening debate, was a standout in a separate debate earlier in the day, delivering a controlled, crisp, and gimlet-eyed performance.\n\nFiorina's question for Trump, asking about the principles by which he will govern, was perhaps the best of the night. As the race continues, with nine more debates and countless media interviews ahead, it remains to be seen if Trump can continue to make up the rules as he goes along.",
    " Title: Senator Rand Paul Declares Victory as Attorney General Holder Clarifies Drone Use on U.S. Soil\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-KY) declared victory on Thursday after Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed in a letter that the president does not have the authority to use a drone to kill a noncombatant American on U.S. soil. The assurance came in response to a 13-hour filibuster by Paul, which delayed a vote on the confirmation of CIA director nominee John Brennan.\n\nDuring the filibuster, Paul had demanded the administration clarify the government's authority to kill on U.S. soil. The filibuster ended early Thursday morning, and the Senate voted 63-34 to confirm Brennan later in the day.\n\nIn the letter, Holder stated, \"It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?' The answer to that question is no.\"\n\nIn response, Paul said, \"We're proud to announce that the president is not going to kill unarmed Americans on American soil.\" He later took to the floor to promote the attorney general's response as the Senate moved to confirm Brennan.\n\nWhile Paul's 13-hour stand drew praise from various political perspectives, the senator also faced criticism from some within his own party. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) argued that Paul's concerns about drone missile attacks on Americans were \"ridiculous.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) displayed a sign showing the number of Americans killed in the U.S. by Al Qaeda (2,958) versus the number killed in the U.S. by drones (0).\n\nPaul, however, argued that he was raising concerns about how future presidents might use their drone authority. He told Fox News that some senators \"think the whole world is a battlefield, including America.\" Paul added, \"I do not think the laws of war apply to America. I think the Bill of Rights do.\"\n\nThe Obama administration increasingly employs armed drones as a counterterrorism tool overseas, while domestic law enforcement agencies are also moving to broaden the use of surveillance mini-drones over the next several years. The Federal Aviation Administration projects as many as 10,000 licensed systems by 2017.\n\nThe lethal drones used in Pakistan are a far cry from the unarmed eyes in the sky used in America. However, Paul and a host of other lawmakers see constitutional pitfalls across the board, focusing on how armed and unarmed drones might someday be used against American citizens.\n\nLawmakers have already started pushing legislation to rein in the drone program, and Paul's dramatic performance Wednesday may give a second look to such legislation. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and Ted Poe (R-TX) last month introduced a bill to regulate domestic drones much like the government regulates wiretaps. The bill would require officials to obtain a warrant in order to perform many kinds of surveillance with those drones and would prohibit law enforcement drones from being equipped with firearms or explosives in U.S. airspace.\n\n\"As we enter this uncharted world of drone technology, Congress must be proactive and establish boundaries for drone use that safeguard the constitutional rights of Americans,\" Poe said in a statement last month. The use of armed drones in U.S. airspace fueled Paul's lengthy filibuster Wednesday.",
    " Title: Polling Discrepancies in U.S. Presidential Election: Debate on Bias and Methodology\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama and congressional Democrats have shown a surge in polls, Republicans are increasingly arguing that the surveys are skewed, with some accusing pollsters of purposely trying to demoralize GOP voters. Pollsters deny any attempt at bias, stating that they are simply sampling people who answer their phones.\n\nPolling firms acknowledge the difficulty of their job, which is bound to receive criticism due to the judgments that have to be made regarding how to handle the data. John Zogby, senior analyst for JZ Analytics, which conducts polling for clients including The \u2588\u2588\u2588, said, \"We\u2019re all taking pulses right now. If you look at them, we\u2019re all pretty close together.\"\n\nPolls over the past week have shown Mr. Obama leading Republican challenger Mitt Romney by 1 percentage point to 8 percentage points in the popular vote. The random samplings of these polls are designed to yield an accurate representation of voter demographics by party, gender, ethnicity, and other categories, but this is easier said than done, especially when surveys usually sample fewer than 1,500 people.\n\nThe question for pollsters then becomes whether to tweak the data to give added weight to responses from groups that often go underrepresented in polls, such as Republicans, young voters, and minorities, to come up with a sampling that better represents the electorate.\n\nCharles Franklin, who runs the Marquette University Law School poll, which is tracking the presidential and U.S. Senate races in Wisconsin, said he adjusts weights for gender, age, and ethnic balance but not for political party. He argued that an increase in participation by a certain party can be an indicator that it is more energized than the other side.\n\nDemocrats historically hold a turnout edge in presidential elections, but their advantage often fluctuates. In 2008, 39 percent of presidential voters were Democrats compared with 32 percent who were Republicans, according to exit polling. The parties each represented 37 percent of the electorate in 2004, which was the Republicans\u2019 largest share in decades.\n\n\"Forcing there to be a certain percentage of your electorate denies that change,\" Mr. Franklin said. \"There\u2019s a legitimate debate as to which way to go, and I don\u2019t think it is by any means a settled statistical question.\"\n\nScott Rasmussen, founder of Rasmussen Reports, which has Mr. Obama with a 1-point lead over Mr. Romney, said, \"We absolutely know that party affiliation is the best single indicator of how someone is going to vote.\"\n\nIn addition to cries of party bias, pollsters are also dealing with issues brought on by technology and changing demographics. Many polls continue to collect their data from calls to landlines rather than cellphones, which could increase responses from older voters who rely on their home phones and minimize participation among younger voters.\n\nMr. Rasmussen predicts that polling might move entirely online in five to 10 years. The different methods and varieties of approaches among the various pollsters mean poll watchers need to take individual surveys with a grain of salt.\n\n\"Look across all of the polling,\" Mr. Franklin said. \"Don\u2019t just try to believe that one poll is always right or that one is always the best. If you see all of the polls pointing in the same direction, that\u2019s certainly more reliable.\"",
    " Title: Global Climate Strike Draws Record Participation in 139 Countries\n\nArticle:\n\nThe global climate strike on Friday, September 20, 2019, saw an unprecedented turnout with 4,638 events scheduled in 139 countries. The strike, organized by the \"Fridays for Future\" movement, led by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, aimed to raise awareness about climate change.\n\nThunberg, who testified at a Capitol Hill hearing on Wednesday, urged U.S. lawmakers to take immediate action, stating, \"I want you to take real action.\" The Fridays for Future website states, \"With the worsening climate destruction, this goal of going to school begins to be pointless. Why study for a future, which may not be there?\"\n\nYouth participants in the climate strike demonstrations displayed a mix of humor and urgency in their protest signs. One sign read, \"We are skipping our lessons to teach you one.\" Another, referencing a popular song, stated, \"It's getting hot in here, so take off all your coal.\"\n\nSocial media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, were flooded with images of climate strike crowds from around the world. Primary school pupils in Abuja, Nigeria, called for climate action, while others demanded climate justice.\n\nThe strike also saw a creative take on the Amazon rainforest fires, with signs reading, \"The wrong Amazon is burning.\" The movement gained widespread support, with many sharing their favorite signs on Twitter.\n\nThis global climate strike is part of a growing movement led by young people, who are urging world leaders to take immediate action to combat climate change.",
    " Title: Virginia Governor Ralph Northam Declares Juneteenth a State Holiday\n\nArticle:\n\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam announced on Tuesday, June 16, 2020, that he will make Juneteenth, a day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, an official holiday in Virginia. The state was once home to the capital of the Confederacy.\n\nJuneteenth, also known as Emancipation Day and Freedom Day, is celebrated annually on June 19. Texas first made it a state holiday in 1980. The holiday will be a paid day off for all state employees. Northam stated that Virginia would be only the second state to do so.\n\n\"It's time we elevate this,\" Northam said of the June 19 commemoration. \"Not just a celebration by and for some Virginians but one acknowledged and celebrated by all of us.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor is granting every executive branch employee this Friday off as a paid holiday and will work with the legislature later this year to pass a law codifying Juneteenth as a permanent state holiday. The legislation is likely to pass the Democratic-controlled legislature with little trouble.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when news reached African Americans in Texas that President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves living in Confederate states two years earlier. When Union soldiers arrived in Galveston to bring the news that slavery had been abolished, former slaves celebrated.\n\nThe announcement came less than two weeks after Northam announced he was ordering the removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee along Richmond's prominent Monument Avenue. It is one of the country's most iconic monuments to the Confederacy. Earlier this year, Northam signed legislation scrapping Lee-Jackson Day, a state holiday named after two Confederate generals.\n\nNearly forced from office last year after a racist yearbook photo surfaced, Northam has won widespread praise among black lawmakers for his actions in Virginia following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck as he pleaded for air.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced last week that he has rescheduled a campaign rally that was planned in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Juneteenth. The announcement of the rally had sparked an outcry because Tulsa was the site of one of the worst instances of racial violence in U.S. history in 1921, when hundreds of African Americans were massacred by a white mob that burned black-owned businesses and homes.\n\nNortham was joined Tuesday at his news conference by musician Pharrell Williams, who is from Virginia. Williams said Juneteenth deserves the same level of recognition and celebration as Independence Day.\n\n\"Here's our day, and if you love us, it'll be your day too,\" Williams said.\n\nIn a statement, state House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert echoed the same sentiments.\n\n\"July 4th is the birthday of our nation, but Juneteenth is the day where it truly began to fulfill its promise of freedom for all,\" Gilbert said. \"For the first time since enslaved Africans landed at Jamestown in 1619, the chains of bondage were finally cast off.\"\n\nJoseph Rogers, a 29-year-old activist who has been a regular protester in Richmond during more than two weeks of demonstrations over Floyd's killing, hailed Northam's announcement.",
    " Title: Boehner Unveils Plan B to Avert Fiscal Cliff, Senate Majority Leader Declares Bill Dead on Arrival\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has unveiled a new strategy to avoid the fiscal cliff, proposing a bill that would increase tax rates for income exceeding $1 million while extending rates for the rest of Americans. The legislation, dubbed \"Plan B,\" has been met with skepticism from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the White House, who argue it still favors the wealthy.\n\nThe bill, which is expected to be voted on this week, is intended to provide cover for House Republicans in case the nation goes over the fiscal cliff and income tax rates increase for all. If President Barack Obama continues to accuse Republicans of prioritizing the wealthy, the backup plan allows them to counter that it is not true.\n\nDespite progress in talks between Obama and Boehner over the past few days, there is still a long way to go before an agreement is reached. The fact that Boehner is putting his own bill forward suggests that negotiations between the White House and the House Republicans have reached a temporary impasse.\n\nBoehner informed Obama about his Plan B during a phone call on Monday night, prompting Obama to inform Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that talks between the White House and Boehner had stalled. White House aides Rob Nabors and Gene Sperling addressed both the Senate and House Democratic caucuses on Tuesday.\n\nIn 13 days, taxes will increase for everyone. Shortly after, tens of billions of dollars in spending cuts for the Pentagon and other federal agencies will take effect. The fact that Boehner is putting his own bill forward indicates that the fiscal cliff negotiations have reached a temporary impasse.\n\nAs of Monday evening, the two sides seemed to be inching toward an agreement. Boehner has moved off his insistence that tax rates not rise for the wealthy and offered the president $1 trillion in fresh revenue, a significant concession that was unthinkable a year ago. However, the fate of the fiscal cliff negotiations remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Debt and Deficit Issues Take a Back Seat in Democratic Presidential Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the four-hour debate among Democratic contenders for the U.S. presidency, the terms \"deficit\" and \"debt\" were scarcely mentioned, with the government's debt being mentioned only once. This reluctance to discuss one of America's most pressing issues - the ballooning annual budget deficits and overall debt under President Donald Trump - is a reflection of the Democrats' apprehension in making it a campaign issue due to the significant budget challenges posed by their popular policies, such as expanding Medicare health coverage and offering government assistance to reduce college costs and student debt.\n\nWhile Democrats claim they have viable plans to cover the costs of these proposals, Republicans argue that their tax-the-rich solutions are unrealistic. On the other side of the political divide, Republicans are equally reticent on the subject, having supported Trump's massive tax cuts and increased military spending - two key drivers of the deficit increase - after championing fiscal conservatism for years. By backing Trump, many Republican lawmakers have essentially abandoned their already waning commitment to balanced budgets and reducing the national debt.\n\nSenator Rob Portman, a former White House budget director and a self-proclaimed hawk on government spending, lamented the lack of interest in addressing the issue. Portman, who was also a strong defender of the 2017 tax-cut law that will drive up the national debt by at least $1 trillion over 10 years, is seen as a fiscal conservative.\n\nEconomists worry that rising debt will lead to higher interest costs, increasing the pressure on future governments to make deep spending cuts or even causing the United States to default on its debt payments, which could have catastrophic global consequences. Bill Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank focused on fiscal policy, likened the situation to termites undermining a porch: \"You step on the porch and everything's fine... Then one day, you fall through.\"\n\nWhen running for president, Trump claimed he would pay off the national debt in about eight years. Instead, it has increased by $2.45 trillion since he took office in January 2017. The total debt outstanding, accumulated over many years of deficits, is now $22.4 trillion, its highest level ever, equating to about $68,000 of debt for every American. The deficit has jumped from $666 billion in fiscal 2017, the final year President Barack Obama's administration had an impact on budgets, to an expected $900 billion this year, and is projected to exceed $1 trillion a year by 2022.\n\nThe prospect of such high and rising debt poses substantial risks for the nation, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. With the U.S. economy expanding, inflation and unemployment low, and the stock market near record levels, the government could be expected to take advantage of the strong fundamentals to reduce deficits. However, the opposite is happening.\n\nAsked about rising deficits last month, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow downplayed concerns, stating, \"It doesn't bother me right now.\" On a campaign stop in Marshalltown, Iowa, former Vice President Joe Biden accused Republicans of running up the nation's debt as a pretext for seeking cuts to federal retirement and healthcare benefits later.\n\n\"Folks, this is a sham,\" said Biden, who has led most polls in the early days of the Democratic primary race. Marlene Rush, a Marshalltown community organizer, said Biden was \"the first Democrat I've heard actually mention the deficits.\" \"I appreciate that. Deficits matter. For Republicans, it seems, they only care about the deficit when Democrats are in the White House,\" she said.\n\nThe first set of Democratic primary debates on June 26-27 in Miami passed without any of the 20 candidates offering up ideas to control debt or deficits. When asked about paying for the expansion of public benefits if they win the White House, Senator Kamala Harris responded, \"I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country?\" Harris' response was met with silence from the other candidates on the stage.\n\nAlthough Republicans portray Democrats as the party of big spending, the last time the budget was balanced was under Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998 and for the next three years. This run ended under Republican George W. Bush, who slashed taxes and fought wars abroad while presiding over large domestic spending increases. Obama, another Democrat, ran deficits high at the start of his presidency to address a deep recession, then trimmed them in his final years in office as the economy picked up.\n\nNow, neither party shows any interest in offering detailed policies to tackle the debt in the 2020 campaign, preferring to focus on healthcare, immigration, and climate change. Maya MacGuineas, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group focused on budget reform, described this era as one of \"hyper-partisanship with both parties engaging in free lunchism to try to appeal to voters.\" Last year, the House of Representatives and Senate formed a special bipartisan panel to examine ways to improve how budgets are written. It failed to make any recommendations, but its operating expenses added about $500,000 to the national debt.",
    " Title: Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber Resigns Amidst Scandal, Leaving Legacy in Question\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber has resigned from office this week, following a scandal that has been likened to a \"Greek tragedy\" by a Democratic Oregon legislator. The events surrounding Kitzhaber's resignation have been marked by confusion and a hint of hubris, a trait that appears to have contributed to the governor's downfall.\n\nThe scandal revolves around Kitzhaber's fianc\u00e9e, Cylvia Hayes, who has been linked to the governor since his 2002 campaign. Hayes, 20 years his junior, has served as an adviser to Kitzhaber, initially drawing scrutiny for her private consulting work during his 2010 campaign. The latest developments involve Hayes advising Kitzhaber and state employees on energy policy while being paid by a group advocating for specific policies. Additionally, she did not disclose some of her income from the state, and the governor reportedly tried to erase his personal emails from public records, raising further questions about the situation.\n\nThese developments have led to a criminal investigation by the state Attorney General and an FBI investigation as well. Kitzhaber had long defended Hayes' work for both the state and private consulting firms, arguing his fianc\u00e9e should be able to maintain a career she had built independently of their relationship.\n\nDespite the scandal, Kitzhaber managed to win reelection last year, but the situation reached a tipping point when it threatened to undermine the Oregon legislature's agenda. Few lawmakers were willing to work with Kitzhaber going forward, and Democrats do not want to \"tarnish an agenda\" that had wide support in the legislature by keeping it pinned to a scandal-marred governor.\n\nKitzhaber's successor, Secretary of State Kate Brown, is seen as more of a Democratic loyalist than Kitzhaber. She will make history as the nation's first openly bisexual governor. Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, stated, \"While she'll make history as the nation's first sitting LGBT governor, the more important truth is that she's supremely capable of leading the state to better days ahead.\"\n\nThe resignation of Governor Kitzhaber leaves his legacy in question, with some, like state Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, expressing concern that it will overshadow the good he has done for the state. Hayward stated, \"This is flat-out Greek tragedy. Kitzhaber has done so many good things for the state.\"",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina Exit 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former HP executive Carly Fiorina have suspended their Republican presidential bids on Wednesday, following a disappointing performance in the New Hampshire primary. Christie and Fiorina finished sixth and seventh, respectively, in the primary contest.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, Christie expressed his political beliefs, stating, \"I ran for president to say that the government needs to once again work for the people, not the people work for the government.\" He added, \"I leave the race without an ounce of regret.\"\n\nFiorina, in a written statement, said, \"I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them.\"\n\nChristie was banking on a strong performance in the New Hampshire contest, seen as more friendly territory for the Northeast governor who did poorly in Iowa. However, his rivals, including current and former governors, outperformed him in the primary.\n\nDespite receiving attention for his aggressive criticism of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at Saturday's debate, the spat seemed to hurt Rubio more than it helped Christie. Rubio finished fifth, while Christie ended up well behind the freshman senator, pulling just 7 percent in the state.\n\nChristie's political career has seen a drastic turnaround. In 2012, he delivered the keynote address at the Republican National Convention, after gaining national political fame for taking on the state's public employee unions and his no-nonsense approach to governing. However, the George Washington Bridge scandal and the controversy surrounding it have politically damaged him.\n\nFiorina, the only female GOP candidate in the 2016 race, entered the primary in April. She promoted herself as an outsider with business experience and argued that as the lone woman in the GOP field, she was best positioned to oppose likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. After a standout performance in the first undercard debate, Fiorina rose to the mainstage and soared in the polls in the fall. However, her momentum quickly stalled, and by the end of the year, she had dropped back down.\n\nFiorina's first major foray into politics was in 2010, when she ran for Senate in California and lost to incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer by 10 points. Throughout her presidential bid, Fiorina emphasized her meteoric rise in the business world. A Stanford University graduate, she started her career as a secretary, earned an MBA, and worked her way up at AT&T to become a senior executive at the telecom giant. However, she was also dogged by questions about her record at Hewlett-Packard, where she was hired as CEO in 1999. She was fired six years later, after leading a major merger with Compaq and laying off 30,000 workers.\n\nThe exits of Christie and Fiorina immediately kick off the race in the still-crowded GOP field to scoop up their support. The 2016 road for these two candidates who showed political promise earlier in the race has now come to an end.",
    " Title: Sen. Lindsey Graham Criticizes Democratic Push for Expanded Background Checks, Argues for System Improvement\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) criticized Democratic efforts to pass new gun-control bills during a recent appearance on CNN's State of the Union, particularly legislation that expands background checks. Graham argued that the current system is broken and needs improvement before any expansion is considered.\n\nGraham cited statistics showing that in 2020, approximately 76,000 individuals who failed a background check were not prosecuted, and in 2010, around 9,000 felons who failed a background check were also not prosecuted. He argued that resources should be directed at fixing the current system before expanding it to include private transfers.\n\nGraham also stated that the legislation being discussed would not have prevented the Sandy Hook massacre, as the shooter did not fail a background check. He further stated that he would not join the five Senate Republicans who pledged to filibuster any legislation that infringes on the Second Amendment, but only if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) did not allow alternative amendments.\n\nSenate Democrats have shifted their focus to background checks since bans on semi-automatic weapons are no longer a priority. New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he considers background checks the \"sweet spot\" because it would do a lot of good and have a good chance of passing. Schumer stated that he is working with both Democrats and Republicans to come up with a background check that will be acceptable to 60 senators and be strong enough to effectively address the issue. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to bring legislation to the floor next month.",
    " Title: U.S. International Trade Commission Forecasts Modest Economic Growth from Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has released a report stating that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would result in modest economic growth for the United States, with an estimated increase in real GDP of nearly $43 billion annually by 2032. The report also predicts the creation of an additional 128,000 full-time jobs.\n\nThe ITC concluded that TPP would have positive effects, albeit small as a percentage of the overall size of the U.S. economy. The biggest winner on a percentage basis would be agriculture and food, which would see a $10 billion boost, up 0.5 percent, by year 15 of the deal.\n\nHowever, the report also indicates that manufacturing, natural resources, and energy would be down by a collective $10 billion, or 0.1 percent, after 15 years. The ITC was asked by Congress to assess the economic impact of the proposed trade deal involving the United States and 11 other countries.\n\nPresident Obama strongly supports the pact and signed it in February. However, the deal is on hold without congressional approval, and no action is currently planned on Capitol Hill. Next week, Obama will be visiting Vietnam and Japan, where he will highlight his support for an economic partnership with those two countries, along with Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Peru.\n\nThe TPP is intended to open markets for U.S. exporters and farmers and help protect intellectual property. It is also meant to strengthen the U.S. political position in Asia. According to Obama, TPP allows America to write the rules of the road in the 21st century, which is especially important in a region as dynamic as the Asia-Pacific.\n\nWhile most economists say TPP would help more than harm the U.S. economy, some critics argue that the new report shows the pact could have disastrous effects. Lori Wallach of Public Citizen states, \"This report spotlights how damaging the TPP would be for most Americans' jobs and wages given it concludes 16 out of 25 U.S. economic sectors would suffer losses while the 'upside' projection is minuscule gains in economic growth despite these findings being based on the same widely criticized methodology and unrealistic assumptions that have resulted in past USITC reports systematically overstating the benefits from trade deals that ended up causing serious damage.\"\n\nIn the past, trade deals have been criticized for failing to meet their corporate and political backers' glowing promises of job creation. For instance, Public Citizen stated last year that trade deals \"have failed to meet their corporate and political backers' glowing promises of job creation.\"\n\nThe ITC report on NAFTA issued in January 1993 predicted only modest gains. It said the \"estimated long-term gains in U.S. and Canadian real GDP are 0.5 percent or less.\" In the post-World War II era, the U.S. economy has averaged a 3.21 percent annual GDP growth rate.\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of NAFTA's implementation, the Congressional Research Service found that \"In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.\"\n\nWhether this new TPP forecast will turn out to be accurate remains to be seen, as the proposed trade deal \"will come into effect anywhere from five to maybe 30 years from now,\" according to Brandeis Professor Peter Petri. \"It's basically a long-term gradual transition in which very small changes will be made along the way, up as long as 30 years in the future.\"\n\nTrade has become a central issue in this year's election cycle. For example, Republican Donald Trump has called TPP \"a horrible deal,\" while Bernie Sanders, running for the Democratic nomination, regularly refers to trade deals as disasters.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Hints at 2016 Presidential Run in Iowa Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, a frontrunner in many early presidential polls, returned to Iowa on Sunday, a state she has not visited since her 2008 Iowa caucus loss to Barack Obama. The former Secretary of State, who has not yet announced her intentions for a 2016 presidential run, appeared alongside her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the annual steak fry hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, a significant event for state Democratic activists.\n\nClinton's speech at the event revealed little about her presidential plans, but did not dampen the widespread belief that she will indeed run. The event, which marked Harkin's last steak fry as he prepares to leave office in January after five terms, was filled with anticipation for Clinton.\n\nCindy Pollard, 57, who was a precinct captain for Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign, expressed her readiness for Clinton's potential return. \"I was a precinct captain for Hillary. I've been decided,\" Pollard said.\n\nThe event took place on a large open field in Indianola, featuring a giant American flag, bales of straw, and rolling hills and cornfields in the background. After speeches by Iowa Democrats running for U.S. Senate and House seats and for governor, Sen. Harkin spoke and introduced Clinton.\n\nHarkin mentioned Clinton's new memoir, stating, \"There are 25 chapters in the book. I'm here to tell you that there are many more chapters to be written in the amazing life of Hillary Clinton.\" As the crowd chanted her name, Clinton stepped up to the microphone, saying, \"Hello, Iowa. I'm baaack.\"\n\nClinton teased the crowd about her visit, stating, \"When Tom Harkin called and asked me to come, I have to admit I was not sure what to say. I've got a few things on my mind these days.\" She mentioned her grandchild-watch duties, as her daughter Chelsea is expecting this month, before addressing the elephant in the room.\n\n\"And then, of course, there's that other thing,\" she said playfully as the crowd cheered. \"It is true I am thinking about it,\" Clinton added, \"but for today, that is not why I'm here.\" The crowd groaned.\n\nNobody expected Clinton to announce anything at the event, but nobody in the crowd seemed to doubt she's running. Some attendees, like Linda Dedecker, an accountant from Ames, were still considering their options. \"I'm considering her,\" Dedecker said, \"but I don't know who else is going to run.\"\n\nDedecker emphasized the importance of Clinton campaigning in Iowa, meeting people face to face, and expressed concern that Clinton and her advisers may not have fully appreciated the state's caucus system in 2008, leading to her third-place finish in the caucuses.\n\nKaren Hill of Marshalltown, a potential Clinton supporter, offered advice for 2016: \"Don't take anything for granted\u2014come and hang out with us for a while.\"\n\nAt the steak fry, a table was also set up on behalf of the push to get Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the race as a progressive alternative to Clinton. One Warren supporter emphasized the importance of not anointing Clinton so early\u2014before anyone has officially declared that they are running.",
    " Title: Trump Calls for Border Legislation, Cites Immigration and DACA\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump reiterated his criticism of the Democratic Party over the country's immigration policies and the lack of a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in a series of tweets on Monday.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump emphasized that Mexico has the power to prevent large groups of migrants, commonly referred to as \"Caravans,\" from entering their country at the northern border. He also stated that the United States lacks effective border laws, which he believes allows people to pass through into the country.\n\nThe President called for immediate passage of Border Legislation, suggesting the use of the \"Nuclear Option\" if necessary, to address the influx of drugs and people. He praised Border Patrol Agents and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) but expressed concern that current Democratic laws impede their ability to perform their duties effectively.\n\nTrump also declared DACA \"dead\" due to the Democrats' lack of action, and stated that the program is no longer viable. He emphasized the need to build a wall and secure the borders with proper border legislation. The President also suggested that Democrats desire open borders, leading to increased drug trafficking and crime.\n\nTrump's comments follow his Sunday tweets threatening that there would be \"NO MORE DACA DEAL.\" The messages come after a report emerged showing photos of over 1,000 migrants from Central America moving through the streets of Mexico, with Mexican immigration officials reportedly taking no action to halt the flow.",
    " Title: Rival Candidates Call for Each Other's Exit Ahead of Super Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a last-ditch effort before Super Tuesday, Donald Trump's Republican rivals are attempting to undermine each other in an attempt to boost their own chances and mount a viable challenge against the billionaire front-runner. Each candidate has called on the others to exit the race.\n\nAhead of a crucial debate on Thursday night, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich have all claimed to be the only candidate capable of derailing Trump, whose momentum has been growing with three consecutive wins in the previous four contests. Ben Carson is the only candidate who has refrained from the fray, instead interpreting his distant finishes as evidence that \"things are starting to happen.\"\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich's campaign, despite performing poorly in the South Carolina and Nevada contests, issued a defiant call on Thursday for Rubio to drop out. Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf tweeted, \". @ JohnKasich is the ONLY candidate who can beat @ realDonaldTrump on 3/15. @ marcorubio needs to do the right thing & suspend campaign.\"\n\nRubio, who has yet to win a primary contest but has been steadily accumulating endorsements from fellow lawmakers and big-name Republicans, has been positioning himself as the best candidate to win a general election in November and the best choice to take on Trump. Rubio acknowledged during a forum with host Megyn Kelly on Wednesday that Trump is \"the frontrunner and I'm the underdog, but I've been an underdog my entire life.\"\n\nThe candidates will square off on Thursday night in Houston for a CNN-Telemundo debate. For some, it could represent their last debate opportunity to define themselves as the anti-Trump candidate, as the field moves on to more than a dozen states holding contests on Super Tuesday. A close sweep by Trump on Tuesday would be devastating for the remaining candidates. Texas, Georgia, and other delegate-heavy states are at stake that day.\n\nAt the forum on Wednesday, Texas Senator Ted Cruz argued that he, not anyone else, is the best alternative candidate since he is the only other one who has won a primary contest, the Iowa caucuses. He said his campaign was \"the only campaign that can beat Donald [and] has beat Donald.\"\n\nTrump, however, has consistently argued against the conventional wisdom that if other candidates drop out, their support will gravitate to the other non-Trump candidates. Trump argues that he would also pick up some of that support. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, agreed with Trump in this regard.\n\n\"Trump will get a share. He might not get a majority, but he'll get a share,\" Sabato told the media outlet.\n\nThe pressure is strongest on candidates Kasich and especially Carson, whose campaign has steadily fallen in the polls and has performed poorly in the first four contests. Carson, however, has appeared immune to the political pressure or the poor showings in South Carolina and Nevada. After placing fourth in Nevada, Carson nevertheless declared to supporters that \"things are starting to happen.\"\n\nCarson seemed to level a bit more with supporters in a fundraising email on Wednesday, saying without a strong showing on Super Tuesday, \"it's going to be very tough for my campaign. That's the honest truth.\"\n\nKasich, however, told the media outlet that \"the people calling for me to get out are the people who are inside the Beltway... I'm certainly not listening to a bunch of lobbyist insiders.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Denny Heck Announces Retirement from Congress, Leaving Democratic-Leaning Seat Open\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Denny Heck (D-WA) has announced his retirement from Congress, citing his discouragement following the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry. In a statement, Heck expressed his dismay at the actions of some of his colleagues who he believes ignored or denied the President's attacks on the free press, character assassinations, and demonstrable disregard for truth.\n\nHeck, who served a decade in the Washington state House, began his political career with his election in 1976. He also served as chief of staff to then-Washington Governor Booth Gardner during Gardner's second term in Olympia. He first ran for Congress in 2010, losing to Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), but won a different seat in 2012 due to post-2010 redistricting.\n\nIn Congress, Heck led recruitment efforts for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) for the past two cycles, personally drafting many of the newly elected Democratic freshman members, including Reps. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and Susie Lee (D-NV). He ran unsuccessfully last year to serve as chairman of the committee, losing a four-way race to Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL).\n\nWashington's 10th District is considered Democratic-leaning territory. Heck won reelection last year with 62% of the vote, and Hillary Clinton carried the district by an 11-point margin in 2016. Heck's retirement is expected to result in a crowded field of candidates vying to succeed him. Under Washington's top-two primary system, all candidates will run together on the same ballot, regardless of party, in the Aug. 4 primary, with the top two finishers advancing to a head-to-head general election.\n\nPossible Democratic candidates for the seat include Olympia Mayor Cheryl Selby, Phil Gardner, Heck's district director, state Reps. Beth Doglio, Christine Kilduff, and Mari Leavitt. Heck already had a Democratic challenger next year: truck driver Joshua Collins.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' U.S. Visit: A Week of Controversy and Expectation\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis' visit to the United States this week is marked by a variety of expectations and controversies, as the pontiff navigates through Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The visit has sparked debate on a range of issues, from capitalism to social justice, and homosexuality to religious liberty.\n\nIn Cuba, the pope received a warm welcome from the Castro brothers, who praised his long-standing commitment to left-wing politics. Raul Castro, in a speech commending Cuba's repressive government, criticized America's economic system and called for the suspension of the trade embargo on Cuba, which he described as \"cruel, immoral, and illegal.\"\n\nPresident Obama is expected to use the pontiff as a tool in his campaign against perceived social injustice, while some believe the pope may soften his stance on homosexuality, given his promise not to judge. Meanwhile, the pope's visit to the United Nations may be met with Marxist bloviation, as the president of Cuba has previously delivered long-winded and bitter speeches in similar forums.\n\nIn Washington D.C., some Catholic members of Congress have discussed boycotting the pope's speech to a joint session, while the White House has reportedly snubbed representatives of the anti-abortion movement. Some bishops are urging the pope to address threats to religious liberty, particularly the requirement in Obamacare for religious institutions to pay for abortions, a practice that violates strongly held faith beliefs.\n\nThe pope's visit to Philadelphia on Saturday will provide an opportunity for him to deliver a final speech at the Independence National Historical Park. The visit is expected to be a significant moment in the tale of three cities, as the pope navigates through the chaos of crosstown traffic and the diverse array of opinions and beliefs that characterize modern America.",
    " Title: Congressional Opposition to Iran Nuclear Deal: Prospects of a \"Better Deal\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Iran nuclear deal, a complex international agreement limiting Iran's nuclear program, is under debate in Congress, the possibility of rejecting the current deal in favor of a \"better deal\" is gaining traction. On Wednesday, Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) announced her opposition to the deal, stating that \"the world could and should have a better deal.\" However, the likelihood of renegotiating and strengthening the deal if Congress rejects it and overcomes a presidential veto is a contentious issue.\n\nThe debate hinges on perceptions of Iran, with critics arguing that Iran should not be entangled in such a complex deal and should not be allowed to possess any uranium enrichment program. Mark Dubowitz, an international sanctions expert and executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) in Washington, suggests that Congress should require the administration to renegotiate certain terms of the proposed deal and resubmit the amended agreement to Congress.\n\nHowever, senior administration officials involved in the Iran negotiations argue that the deal cannot be renegotiated, and warn that rejection of the deal would likely result in a more aggressive uranium enrichment program by Iran, shortening the \"breakout\" time for Iran to rush to produce a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so. Secretary of State John Kerry has described the prospect of a \"better deal\" as a \"fantasy.\"\n\nSome nonproliferation experts share this view, stating that the Iranian nuclear program is too advanced to be significantly reduced. Jeffrey Lewis, director of nonproliferation studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif., states, \"The most important thing now is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon in the next 10 to 15 years, and this deal does that.\"\n\nOthers believe a renegotiated deal could block Iran's paths to a nuclear weapon. FDD's Mr. Dubowitz outlines three potential scenarios if Congress rejects the current deal and holds out for a renegotiated deal: Iran could implement its commitments under the deal, abandon its commitments and escalate its nuclear program, or attempt to comply with certain commitments while abandoning others. In any of these scenarios, Dubowitz suggests that the US could work to persuade European allies to join in demanding a renegotiation of key parts of the deal.\n\nHowever, regional experts question the prospects of wooing European allies to join the US in pressing for a tougher deal. Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, stated this week that European allies would likely feel frustrated and misled in the wake of a US rejection of the deal, and would likely invest in Iran's energy sector.\n\nSuspicions among deal supporters that those calling for a \"better deal\" are not sincere in their pursuit of a stronger deal are also prevalent. Jeffrey Lewis states, \"We had a 'better deal' in Iraq after 1991 [following the Gulf War], there were no restrictions, inspectors could go where they wanted when they wanted, and that deal wasn't good enough. So really I don't believe them when they say they just want a 'better deal' this time.\"\n\nCritics of the \"better deal\" campaign also point out that the sponsor of the TV ad campaign is a group called Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, which is backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel organization lobbying Congress hard for the deal's defeat. \"There really is no 'better deal' for [such critics] in the sense of an agreement that leaves any nuclear program in the hands of the current Iranian government,\" Lewis says. \"Any deal is bad because it means living with the Islamic Republic.\"",
    " Title: Study Finds Higher Lead Levels in Blood of Children Relying on Private Wells for Drinking Water\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found that American children whose homes rely on private wells for drinking water are 25 percent more likely to have high lead levels in their blood than those with access to regulated community water services. The research, which is the first to specifically analyze lead exposure in children who rely on private wells, was conducted by researchers examining the water sources and health records from almost 60,000 children in North Carolina.\n\nThe study found that children relying on private wells had blood lead concentrations that were 20 percent higher, on average, than children with community water service. The study also found that children living in older, lower-value houses suffered higher lead levels and had higher risks of elevated blood lead, as did those in majority-Black neighborhoods.\n\nLead, a heavy metal which has no smell and is invisible to the naked eye, is a suspected carcinogen and highly toxic to the brain and nervous system, as well as most other organs. The water scandal in Flint, Michigan, in 2014 exposed concerns about lead in regulated city drinking water supplies, but little attention has been paid to dangerous contaminants in unregulated private wells which provide drinking water to 42.5 million Americans, the equivalent of 13 percent of the population.\n\n\"Risks are especially high for children in low-income households and in African American neighborhoods that remain excluded from access to nearby municipal water service\u2014a legacy of discriminatory zoning practices,\" said Jackie MacDonald Gibson, author of the study and chair of the department of environmental and occupational health at the Indiana University school of public health. \"This unfortunate legacy contributes to persistent intergenerational poverty through its impacts on children\u2019s cognitive development.\"\n\nThere is no safe lead level, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and childhood exposure has been linked to reduced IQ, ADHD, school failure, and criminality. The increased exposure is probably due to corrosion of indoor plumbing and well components.\n\nPrivate wells are excluded from the Safe Drinking Water Act, which since 1991 has required all community water utilities to monitor lead levels as part of the Lead and Copper Rule provision. This means households with private wells must monitor their own water quality, and, when necessary, replace parts and install and manage their own corrosion-control systems. However, according to Gibson, lead control requires awareness of the risks, knowledge about testing, and money, which is seldom done.\n\n\"This study highlights the need for an overhaul of the Safe Drinking Water Act to provide support for households relying on private wells,\" Gibson said. \"That includes financial support, and education and support on proper testing. No level of lead exposure is safe. This is an issue that must continue to be addressed.\"",
    " Title: George Papadopoulos Claims Sessions Was Enthusiastic About Trump-Putin Summit in 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a former advisor to the Trump campaign, has stated that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions was \"quite enthusiastic\" during the 2016 campaign about the prospect of a summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Papadopoulos recounted a roundtable meeting in 2016 where he mentioned his connection that could establish a summit between the two leaders.\n\nAccording to Papadopoulos, President Trump, then a candidate, seemed noncommittal, but Sessions appeared \"quite enthusiastic\" about the idea. However, Sessions has testified that he pushed back on the idea.\n\nPapadopoulos was sentenced to two weeks in prison on Friday for lying to investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. He pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to federal investigators about his contacts with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who supposedly told him in 2016 that Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic opponent.\n\nDuring the interview, Papadopoulos also addressed an email about the possible dirt he was alleged to have sent to John Mashburn, a Trump campaign and White House official. He stated, \"If I did send an email, and especially if others were copied on it, I\u2019m sure that evidence would have [been] introduced by now.\" He added, \"If that email was sent, even if I deleted it, if that\u2019s what people believe I did, there would be a copy somewhere else.\"\n\nPapadopoulos also expressed uncertainty about whether special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation would reveal actual collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. \"All I can say is that my testimony might have helped move something towards that,\" he said, \"but I have no idea.\"\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly stated there was \"no collusion.\"",
    " Title: Biden, Sanders Cancel Campaign Events Amid Coronavirus Outbreak; Trump Campaign Shifts to Virtual Engagement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have canceled campaign events and shifted their operations to virtual engagements. The Trump campaign, too, has adjusted its strategies, moving towards online events and remote work for its staff.\n\nJoe Biden delivered a sober speech on Thursday, with only his wife, Jill, in the camera shot. Bernie Sanders, known for his large rallies, has also suspended large events. The Trump campaign had been eager to hold a fundraiser with casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, which was canceled, as well as the first lady's scheduled Los Angeles fundraiser, now under a state of emergency.\n\nBoth the Biden and Sanders campaigns have opted for remote work. The Biden campaign has instructed employees at its Philadelphia headquarters to work from home starting this weekend, while staffers in other locations can choose to work from home or short-term housing rentals. The Sanders campaign has similarly asked all staff to work from home.\n\nField organizing, traditionally conducted in-person, has become more complex due to the outbreak. The Republican National Committee (RNC) had planned a National Week of Training, a nationwide effort to recruit and activate supporters, which is now set to be held online and over the phone.\n\nThe Trump campaign, with its extensive digital infrastructure and database, is relying on its online presence to engage voters. The reelection effort recently launched ArmyforTrump.com, a website designed to serve as an online hub for volunteers.\n\nTim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, stated, \"The Trump campaign is built on data and uses technology to its highest advantages, so is better positioned to virtually engage voters than any other campaign.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign, in its Thursday memo, announced the closure of all field offices to the public and plans to organize voters through phone banking, text messaging, virtual events, and other distributed organizing models. The Sanders campaign, in response to the outbreak, has halted door-to-door canvasses and will move to digital formats and outreach wherever possible.\n\nWhile Trump advisers express concerns about the president's response to the coronavirus and its impact on his reelection hopes, they remain relatively optimistic. However, they acknowledge the political risks associated with the ongoing crisis, as schools and offices close, and people lose their lives.\n\nRon Klain, a top Biden campaign adviser, emphasized the importance of a swift and effective response to the coronavirus, implying that the current administration has not followed this approach. \"The No. 1 question right now,\" said Klain, \"is what's your response to this coronavirus?\"",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Shift: A New Approach to Iran and North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in his first year in office, often deferred to the advice of cautious national security advisors, adding troops to the war in Afghanistan, delaying plans to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and preserving a nuclear-containment deal with Iran. However, in his second year, Trump has adopted a more assertive foreign policy, trusting his own efforts to negotiate, coerce, and intimidate global rivals.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump took his latest step in this direction by withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, a move that has sparked criticism and concerns about potential risks. The U.S. shift towards a more confrontational approach to Iran led to Syrian officials reporting Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets near Damascus, raising fears of increased conflict in the Middle East.\n\nTrump's approach has been described as high-risk, with the potential for significant successes or failures. Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who advocated for changes to the Iran deal, not its scrapping, said, \"It's the Art of the Deal: Refuse to be bound by existing agreements that are not in America's interest. Exit, or threaten to exit, these agreements and use maximum pressure in order to get a better deal.\"\n\nCritics argue that Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran deal makes it less likely that North Korea will agree to a deal with the U.S. However, Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, contends that the move strengthens the U.S.'s hand in negotiations.\n\nTrump's approach to North Korea, characterized by threats and pressure, has raised fears of a nuclear war. Yet, Trump's supporters argue that the threats have rattled North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un. The U.S. is now relying more on Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's two biggest rivals in the Middle East, to counter Iran's regional influence.\n\nTrump's foreign policy strategy has been compared to President Ronald Reagan's approach to the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Reagan's style, like Trump's, stoked fears of nuclear war, but he eventually negotiated a historic reduction in nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union. However, there were differences, with Reagan relying on the recommendations of his seasoned national security team, while Trump has often clashed with his own advisors.\n\nTrump's allies argue that his approach to foreign policy is a template for Iran: use threats to intimidate adversaries, pressure allies into taking tough steps to isolate the troubling rival, and force people to the negotiating table. The administration faces challenges in persuading European allies to work with the U.S. after dismissing their attempts to save the Iran deal. European leaders have distanced themselves from the U.S. decision and vowed to work with Iran to salvage the agreement.",
    " Title: Republican Tax Policy Makers to Propose Corporate Tax Rate Reduction, Avoid Individual Tax Rate Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump and top Republicans in Congress are set to reveal a plan on Wednesday targeting tax cuts for businesses, with few details about how to replace the reduced federal revenues, according to lobbyists and congressional sources. The \"Big Six\" team of Republican tax policy makers, which includes top Trump aides and congressional Republican leaders, is expected to propose a corporate income tax target rate within a range of 18-23 percent, down from the current rate of 35 percent.\n\nHowever, the Big Six is expected to refrain from cutting the top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent, a move that many Republicans in the House of Representatives could find difficult to accept. Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank who helped write Trump's campaign tax plan, predicted that they will not cut the highest income tax rate.\n\nOverhauling the tax code was a key pledge for Trump in his 2016 presidential campaign. After eight months in office, he has made only limited progress, with Washington achieving no major tax overhaul since 1986.\n\nTrump portrays lower corporate taxes as a boon to workers, stating that they would lead to more jobs and higher salaries. A rate cut on corporate profits could also benefit shareholders and offer more executive bonuses, however.\n\nThe Big Six, which also includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, and two tax committee chairmen, have been working on their plan for months. They are still undecided on key issues, including whether to let businesses write off new investments immediately, how to lower tax rates for small businesses, and whether to cut middle-class taxes simply by doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families, according to lobbyists.\n\nResolving such issues will help determine how aggressively Republicans can cut corporate taxes. Lobbyists said they do not expect the Big Six to offer many details about the tax loopholes and deductions that could be eliminated to help pay for tax cuts.\n\nThe Big Six is also expected to address the estimated $2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate profits held overseas by requiring companies to bring the money home at rates of 3.5 percent for reinvested profits and 8.75 percent for on cash and equivalents, lobbyists said. To offset lost revenue, the Trump administration plans to forecast a flood of new tax revenue in coming years, based on aggressive assumptions of tax-fueled economic expansion.\n\nHowever, Senate Republicans have shown signs of moving away from such \"dynamic\" scoring of any tax legislation impact. Two senators, including a prominent fiscal hawk, agreed this week to a \"static\" score that could allow tax reform to lose up to $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Senate Republicans are also likely to avoid budget baseline changes to generate savings for tax reform on paper, which could well mean the Big Six plan would balloon the federal budget deficit.\n\n\"Without those, the price goes up. There's no other way to look at it,\" said John Gimigliano, a former House Ways and Means Committee tax counsel who leads federal legislative and regulatory services at KPMG LLP.",
    " Title: Trump's Appointment of Retired Generals for Cabinet Positions: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint retired generals to cabinet-level positions, such as Michael Flynn as national security adviser, James Mattis as defense secretary, and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security, has been met with criticism for supposedly \"militarizing\" the government. However, this practice is not unprecedented in American politics.\n\nHistorically, retired generals and admirals have held cabinet positions and other high offices in the United States. For instance, during Barack Obama's administration, Petraeus served as CIA director, and Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Other retired generals, such as Eric Shinseki, James Jones, Dennis Blair, and James Clapper, held high-ranking positions in Obama's administration.\n\nRonald Reagan also appointed a number of retired and acting generals to cabinet positions or other high offices, including Al Haig as secretary of state, Colin Powell (while on active duty) as national security adviser, and Vernon Walters as ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nIn the 20th century, many of the stars of the American effort in World War II later served in the executive branch. President Harry Truman appointed General George Marshall, of Marshall Plan fame, as secretary of state and later secretary of defense. General Omar Bradley was head of the Veterans Administration while still on active duty.\n\nThe chief complaint about Trump's appointments is that too many generals will mean too great a likelihood of war. However, historical evidence points to the opposite conclusion. Generals were not the proverbial \"best and brightest\" who argued for military intervention in Vietnam, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, or the bombing of Libya in 2011.\n\nTraditionally, retired generals and flag officers have no desire to see their own troops killed in what they see as optional wars abroad. Their occasional harangues about building up military power are predicated on notions of peace-through-strength deterrence: The more powerful the military is perceived abroad, the less likely it will be needed to be used.\n\nFar more worrisome is the tired presidential custom of relying on ex-senators and politicians with law degrees to fill important executive positions despite their lack of outside-the-Beltway administrative experience. In 2008, Obama's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 consisted mainly of having been a Harvard Law School grad and, briefly, a U.S. senator. No wonder he looked to people with similar backgrounds for some key appointments\u2014former senator and lawyer Joe Biden as vice president, former senator and lawyer Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, and later, former senator and lawyer John Kerry as secretary of state.\n\nLawyers, Ivy League graduates, and former politicians usually dominate presidential appointments. How have these stereotypical profiles worked out? We are currently nearing $20 trillion in national debt, stagnating under nonexistent economic growth and near-zero interest rates, and suffering from record labor nonparticipation rates. We are seeing a failed health-care system, a discredited IRS and VA, and the worst racial relations in half a century. Generals did not compile that record. Lawyers and lifetime Washington politicians did.",
    " Title: Democratic Political Group Launches Ad Campaign Questioning Bernie Sanders' Electability and Health in Nevada\n\nArticle:\n\nA Democratic political action committee (PAC), the Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI), has initiated a new ad campaign in Nevada, targeting presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The group has purchased tens of thousands of dollars in cable and network ad time this week ahead of the February 22nd presidential nominating caucuses, according to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filings.\n\nThe exact size of DMFI's Nevada purchase is not immediately clear, as the group has not yet filed an independent expenditure report with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as of Friday morning. However, FCC filings indicate the total size of the buy is over $175,000.\n\nDMFI ran similar anti-Sanders ads in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses earlier this month. The thirty-second video spot questions Sanders' ability to win a general election and raises concerns about the Vermont senator's health. A woman featured in the ad states, \"I do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders' health, considering he did have a heart attack.\"\n\nMark Mellman, a Democratic consultant who runs DMFI PAC, stated that the group's ad in Nevada would be different from the one that ran in Iowa, but did not provide further details.\n\nDMFI has received the majority of its funding from a few high-dollar donors. Stacy Schusterman, a Tulsa oil and gas heiress, donated nearly $1 million to DMFI PAC in December, according to FEC records. The group also received $495,000 from venture capitalist Mark Gary Lauder.\n\nDMFI's new offensive against Sanders comes as he attempts to gain ground in the race for Democratic delegates in the third presidential nominating contest. He currently trails former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg by a pair of delegates despite strong showings in both Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThe group's plans for a Nevada attack on Sanders were first reported by Mediaite. FCC filings posted on the agency's website on Wednesday and Thursday show DMFI has purchased ad time on broadcast stations in Las Vegas and Reno, as well as a host of statewide cable programs.",
    " Title: U.S. Court of Appeals Orders Judge to Respond to Petition for Dismissal of Michael Flynn's Case\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has instructed Judge Emmet Sullivan to respond to an emergency petition filed by Michael Flynn's lawyers, seeking to compel Sullivan to grant a Justice Department request to dismiss the criminal case against the former national security adviser.\n\nFlynn, a retired Army lieutenant general who also advised Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's U.S. ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, in the weeks before Trump took office. The charges were part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's candidacy.\n\nIn May, the Department of Justice, in a major reversal, asked Sullivan to drop the charges, drawing accusations from Democrats and retired career prosecutors that Attorney General William Barr was politicizing the U.S. criminal justice system to go light on Trump's friends and associates.\n\nFlynn later sought to withdraw his plea and accused the FBI of tricking him. The Department's decision to ask Sullivan to drop the charges followed public pressure from Trump and the Republican president's political allies.\n\nLast week, Sullivan signaled reluctance to drop the charges, appointing a retired judge to advise whether Flynn should face an additional criminal contempt charge for perjury. Sullivan has scheduled an in-person court hearing in the case for July 16.\n\nFlynn served as national security adviser in the first weeks of Trump's presidency before being fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his dealings with Kislyak.",
    " Title: U.S. Policy in Syria: A Look at the Unintended Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent string of tragedies in cities such as Orlando, Istanbul, Dhaka, Baghdad, Medina, and Nice have been linked to the ongoing Syrian conflict. A common argument suggests that if the United States had taken a more active role in Syria's civil war, the Islamic State (ISIL) might not have gained traction, and the scale of the war might have been significantly smaller. However, a new analysis challenges this conventional wisdom, arguing that a different policy approach could have prevented the chaos currently engulfing the region.\n\nAccording to this perspective, the U.S. and its allies should have allowed Syrian President Bashar Assad to win the war. This alternative policy would have prevented the rise of ISIL and the ensuing chaos. Instead, an anti-ISIL coalition recently met in Washington to discuss next steps against the caliphate and its affiliates.\n\nSeveral key points are worth considering when examining the origins of the Syrian civil war. First, the moderate opposition was weak, with limited resources and inexperienced fighters. Providing lethal aid early would have resulted in weapons falling into the wrong hands, exacerbating the conflict rather than mitigating it.\n\nSecond, the opposition was disorganized and lacked coherent leadership. While names like Assad, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (leader of ISIL), and Abu Mohammad al-Julani (head of the Nusra Front) are well-known, few can name leaders within the moderate Syrian opposition, such as the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition.\n\nThird, Assad and his allies had a clear objective: maintain power. Syria's allies were unburdened by the regime's atrocities, as they had a vested interest in Assad's survival. In contrast, the U.S. found itself in a catch-22, as attacking Assad would aid extremist rebels, while attacking extremist rebels would aid Assad. Unwilling to back either party and lacking a clear alternative, the U.S. had no clear goal or strategy, leading to a lack of intervention and a rising body count.\n\nIn this context, the U.S. pursued a third way. When President Obama called on Assad to step down in August 2011, the U.S. invested in Assad's defeat without implementing policies to facilitate that outcome. The possibility of Assad winning the war outright was no longer an option, and U.S. acquiescence to a political solution in which Assad remained became increasingly difficult.\n\nTo address the situation, the U.S. imposed additional sanctions on the Syrian government, froze Syrian assets under U.S. control, prohibited commercial ties with Damascus, and blocked the import of Syrian oil. The U.S. also established supply routes, funneled money, intelligence, and non-lethal aid to handpicked rebels, many of whom later switched sides. Physical supplies included communications equipment, night vision goggles, bulletproof vests, pickup trucks, food, medicine, and more.\n\nHowever, these actions were insufficient to prevent Assad's victory and prolonged the war. Furthermore, the U.S. and its partners did little to prevent states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia from sending vast sums of materiel and money to Assad's opposition, including its most extreme elements. Turkey faced little pressure to control its border, even as thousands of militants flooded into Syria to join the war.\n\nIn essence, the main problem with U.S. policy toward Syria is not that the administration did too little early in the conflict. It is that the administration did too much. If the U.S. and its partners had not intervened, Assad would have likely quelled the civil war before it began. A brutal dictator would have retained control of his country, but the death toll would be lower, Syria would be more stable, the refugee crisis might not have occurred, and ISIL might never have taken its current form.\n\nWhen examining the unintended consequences of intervention in Iraq and Libya, it is crucial to consider the same in Syria. As Seth Cantey, an assistant professor of politics at Washington & Lee University, notes, \"We should see that when we look at Syria, too.\"",
    " Title: North Dakota Senators Heitkamp and Cramer Agree on Civility, Differ on Key Issues in Final Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a display of political civility, North Dakota Senators Heidi Heitkamp and Kevin Cramer, engaged in their final debate ahead of the November midterm elections, agreeing on the need for more civility in American politics following the arrest of a pro-Trump bomber earlier in the day.\n\nThe debate, held Thursday, took place amidst the backdrop of the arrest of Florida resident Cesar Sayoc, who is accused of sending dangerous packages to CNN and Democratic leaders who have criticized President Trump. Both senators, in their opening statements, distanced themselves from any blame, stating that Sayoc was solely responsible for his actions.\n\nThe harmony between the two candidates comes after critics have accused President Trump of using divisive rhetoric, with some suggesting it may have sparked one of his supporters to terrorize the nation this week. In response, Heitkamp recalled Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who was shot and wounded by a left-wing partisan last year, speaking in the aftermath of the attack.\n\n\"He never once mentioned Democratic politics,\" said Heitkamp. \"Looking at that as an example, the message couldn't be clearer\u2014we all need to quit blaming. There is only one person responsible here,\" she said.\n\nBoth senators acknowledged the need for accountability in their words, with Cramer, a Trump-ally, emphasizing the importance of debates, like the one they held Thursday, as an opportunity to celebrate political civility.\n\nThe two have been in a fierce race, with Heitkamp trying to hold onto her seat in the U.S. Senate this November in a state where Trump won by 36 points. However, Heitkamp's poll numbers have sunk after voting against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. In a poll released this week, she is behind Cramer by 16 points, a significant increase from the four-point deficit she faced prior to her vote against the president's high court pick.\n\nDespite the setback, Heitkamp's campaign has received more than $12 million in donations during the first two weeks of October, according to a recent filing with the Federal Elections Commission. Former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the bomber's targets earlier this week, is set to campaign for Heitkamp, kicking off her statewide tour in Fargo next week.\n\nBoth lawmakers agreed on the need for a border wall and increased security to deter illegal immigrants from entering the country, as thousands of migrants from Central America are heading to the border through a caravan.\n\n\"We can not leave our borders unprotected. The rule of law has to be imposed\u2014if there is 4,000 today, there will be a million tomorrow,\" said Heitkamp, distancing herself from many of her Democratic colleagues who have balked at a wall along the southern border.\n\n\"We ought to have something to say about who comes in our country,\" said Cramer.\n\nBoth lawmakers also disagreed on the Paris Climate Accord, with Heitkamp and Cramer opposing Trump's decision to pull out of the agreement. However, they sparred over the Affordable Care Act and whether to fix the law as it exists, or to repeal and replace it entirely.\n\nCramer argued that money should go to the states, where they can provide better health care options for constituents, while Heitkamp said not to throw the baby out with the bathwater\u2014and instead, fix areas of the healthcare law which aren't working. The debate concluded with both lawmakers yielding time to one another, demonstrating a level of respect and civility that was evident throughout the hour-long showdown.",
    " Title: AFL-CIO President Warns Hillary Clinton of Political Consequences Over Pacific Trade Pact\n\nArticle:\n\nRichard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the nation's most powerful labor union, has warned Hillary Clinton of potential political repercussions if she fails to oppose President Obama's key trade legislation, the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also known as \"fast-track.\" In an interview with Capital Download, Trumka predicted that no more than 20 House Democrats would vote for the TPA, which would require Congress to approve or reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal among the United States and 12 other Pacific Rim nations, without amendments.\n\nThe AFL-CIO and the Obama administration have found themselves on opposing sides in a contentious political battle over the TPA. Many labor unions have halted campaign donations as they lobby against the legislation. The TPP would lower trade barriers, but organized labor argues that it will cost jobs and lower wages in the U.S.\n\nTrumka expressed uncertainty about Clinton's stance on the issue, stating, \"She's going to have to answer that.\" He suggested that her position on the TPP and TPA will significantly impact her presidential campaign. If Clinton supports the trade pact and the fast-track authority, it could negatively affect her ability to mobilize working people for her campaign, according to Trumka.\n\nWhen asked about the impact of Obama's presidency on working Americans, Trumka expressed mixed feelings. He acknowledged the president's challenges in delivering results due to opposition from the Republican Party, but also criticized Obama for not fighting harder for policies that would benefit working Americans.\n\nIn the Senate vote, Trumka was surprised to see Democratic senators Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware, and Patty Murray of Washington state vote in favor of the TPA. When asked about the difficulty of defeating a president, Trumka replied, \"We'll see.\" The AFL-CIO president also hinted that the union might not endorse a presidential candidate if both candidates were not interested in raising wages and creating jobs.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Temporary Immigration Suspension, Sparking Debate on Economic Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Monday via Twitter that he would be signing an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration to the United States in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The order, which is more limited than the initial announcement suggested, will halt the issuance of permanent residency visas, or green cards, for 60 days. The order does not affect temporary workers and reportedly includes exceptions for workers in \"essential\" professions and family members of U.S. citizens.\n\nThe move is intended to \"protect the jobs\" of American workers amid an unprecedented spike in unemployment caused by lockdown measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. Immigration has already been significantly curtailed during the outbreak due to travel restrictions and a pause in most visa processing procedures.\n\nThe economic impact of the order is a subject of debate. Limiting restrictions to green card applicants, who represent a fraction of the immigrant workforce, may have little to no impact on jobs, many economists say.\n\nTrump's conservative allies argue that the order is a sincere, if limited, attempt to ensure that jobs are reserved for the more than 20 million Americans who have become unemployed since the start of the crisis.\n\nOthers view the order as a political tactic. Critics argue that cutting immigration was a key element of Trump's 2016 election platform and that doubling down on that strategy could serve to invigorate his base supporters and distract from the administration's response to the virus, which has received significant criticism.\n\nSome of the president's liberal critics say he is using the crisis as an opportunity to impose an anti-immigrant agenda that has been high on the Republican to-do list since long before the pandemic began.\n\nThe initial 60-day freeze on new green cards could be extended indefinitely depending on economic conditions, Trump said. He also said the administration was considering a \"secondary order\" that could further limit immigration down the road.\n\nThe pandemic provides an opportunity to enact Trump's wish list of immigration policies, according to some analysts. White House adviser Stephen Miller has long advocated for shutting down most immigration, legal and illegal. In the coronavirus, they may have found their opening.\n\nTrump is also being accused of looking for anyone else to blame for the crisis. Some argue that he is using immigrants, public health officials, governors, and the news media as scapegoats to avoid accountability for his response to the pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which the order will impact the economy remains to be seen. The order is set to take effect on Wednesday.",
    " Title: Israel's Election Results Remain Unclear as Netanyahu and Gantz Tied in Initial Vote Count\n\nArticle:\n\nInitial vote counting in Israel's historic election shows no clear winner as of Wednesday morning, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and Benny Gantz's rival Blue and White party reportedly tied with 32 seats each, according to Israel's Kan public broadcaster and an exit poll on Channel 12. Official results are not expected to be announced until Wednesday afternoon local time.\n\n\"We're still waiting for the results,\" Netanyahu told supporters early Wednesday morning at the Likud election headquarters in Tel Aviv. \"But one thing is clear, the State of Israel is at a historic turning point. We are facing immense opportunities and immense challenges... including the existential threat from Iran,\" he added.\n\nNetanyahu also stated that Israel will never have a government \"that leans on Arab, anti-Zionist parties.\"\n\nGantz, on the other hand, said, \"We were busy with the campaign for too long. And with your permission, we will be waiting for another day or two, and we wish the people of Israel a good and desirable unity government.\"\n\nTuesday's election is said to be a referendum on Netanyahu, who has served as Israel's longest-running prime minister. This is an unprecedented election as it is the first time Israel has held elections twice in the same year. Netanyahu's Likud party won the election in April, but the prime minister's inability to form a government coalition weeks after the election sent millions of Israelis back to the polls on Tuesday.\n\nAfter casting his ballot in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said the vote would be \"very close.\"\n\n\"It's not in the bag. But if you go [vote], we will win,\" Netanyahu told Israelis in Jerusalem.\n\nGantz voted in his hometown of Rosh Haayin and asked fellow Israelis to end Netanyahu's long reign as prime minister.\n\n\"We will bring hope, we will bring change, without corruption, without extremism,\" he said.\n\nThere was plenty of drama as Israelis made their way to the polls. Police reported at least 29 arrests and 69 investigations were launched against individuals suspected of voting fraud and other violations. Voting slips were vandalized, several people illegally filmed inside the voting booths, and one man cut the power at a polling site and stole several voting slips. One suspect even threw a firework outside a polling station outside Jerusalem.\n\nIsraeli media also reported that the Blue and White website was shut down due to a cyberattack hours before polls closed. The party said the \"significant cyberattack\" was carried out in a wide-scale operation.\n\n\"Over 500 attempted breaches were detected from various servers abroad,\" the party said.\n\nBoth Likud and Blue and White are cautious not to celebrate any perceived victory too early. Party leaders are waiting for the final vote to be counted. Official results will only come out in the next week, and forming a government can take another month or more after that. If no government is formed, Israelis will go to a third round of elections. For now, Israelis are waiting to see if a government is formed and what it will look like.",
    " Title: Beijing Wins 2022 Winter Olympics in Low-Key Manner\n\nArticle:\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has awarded the 2022 Winter Games to Beijing, China, in a joint bid with the nearby city of Zhangjiakou. The decision was made in a 44-40 vote, with the remote Central Asian city of Almaty, Kazakhstan, being the sole rival. This makes Beijing the first city to host both the winter and summer competitions, following the 2008 Olympics.\n\nThe announcement was met with a brief celebration, contrasting the exuberant response 14 years ago when Beijing won the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. This time, people paused during the evening rush hour to watch the IOC announcement on television and mobile phones, but the crowd dispersed quickly.\n\nFinancial analyst Zhang Shuo, a 30-year-old with Huatai Insurance Group, expressed indifference towards the winter sports activities, citing their expense and lack of personal interest. In contrast, 14 years ago, Beijing erupted in triumph, with cars honking their horns, people waving flags, and strangers hugging.\n\nThe low-key response to the 2022 Winter Olympics win is attributed to several factors, including winter sports being less popular in China, a less aggressive publicity campaign by Beijing, and the significance of hosting a second Olympics being less freighted due to the triumphant return to the world stage that the 2008 Olympics represented.\n\nHere is a summary of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics:\n- Beijing will be the first city to host both a Summer and Winter Games.\n- The total budget is $3.9 billion, with $1.98 billion for operations and $1.92 billion for infrastructure.\n- The budget does not include a new 108-mile high-speed train line linking Beijing with mountain venues.\n- There are 12 venues, half of which are recycled from the 2008 Summer Games.\n- The average snow depth at the alpine skiing venue in February is 5.3 inches.\n\nChina is expected to spend far beyond the official event budget, as it did for the 2008 Olympics, which brought an additional $36 billion in redevelopment, subway lines, and building bedroom communities. The games are projected to bring 350 billion yuan (approximately $56.4 billion) in investment, primarily for Zhangjiakou and the surrounding rural areas.\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics seem to be more focused on addressing the needs of a prosperous population eager for leisure activities, as opposed to the national ambitions that characterized the 2008 Olympics. The emerging middle class in Beijing has doubled its disposable income since 2008, and the ski resorts outside Zhangjiakou are now packed with Beijingers.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of the winter sports, however. Amid the performers organized by the Beijing government to watch the IOC ceremony was 21-year-old subway worker Xiao Shuai, who expressed indifference towards winter sports due to their expense and accessibility.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Political Victory for Donald Trump: A Shift in U.S. Politics and Society\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, billionaire developer Donald Trump has been elected as the 45th President of the United States, marking a significant political rebellion among rural white America. This unexpected victory has overthrown the perceived dominance of the Democratic Party and challenged the predictions of political pundits.\n\nThe election results, which also secured Republican control of the House and Senate, were largely attributed to a Republican surge that went unnoticed in most polling. According to Columbia University political science professor Donald P. Green, the polls underestimated two key factors: voter discontent and the Republicans' loyalty to their party's nominee, despite the ambivalence expressed by GOP leaders.\n\nThe Trump presidency promises at least four years of a unified Washington, potentially leading to significant shifts in the nation's direction on core issues such as foreign policy, trade, immigration, health care, and the environment.\n\nTrump's victory marks a reversal of the narrative of the past few years, as many conservative white voters have expressed despair over what they perceive as America's economic, military, and cultural decline. With Trump's election, they have emphatically turned the tables on Democratic voters.\n\nAfter conceding the election, Hillary Clinton called Trump to congratulate him on a \"very, very hard-fought campaign.\" Trump, in turn, called for national unity, pledging to be a president for all Americans and reaching out to those who did not support him for guidance and help in unifying the nation.\n\nTrump's core supporters, primarily whites without college degrees, turned out in large numbers and supported him to an unprecedented degree. This mixed up the nation's long-standing order of electoral swing states, with Trump taking Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nExurban and rural areas were the heartland of Trump's support. In areas such as Newton County, Georgia, Trump won by significant margins. Exit polls showed Trump winning 80 percent or more of voters who rated \"change\" as their top priority.\n\nAl Fortune, a trucking company manager, expressed expectations for job creation, conservative healthcare reform, and energy independence from the Middle East if Trump were elected. This seems to reflect the voter who prioritizes change.\n\nNow, it will be up to Trump to deliver on his voters' expectations. They are expecting decisive action from the new president.\n\nIn New Hampshire, lifelong resident Tyler Brouillard registered as a Republican and voted for Trump, expecting high-speed change in U.S. policies. Brouillard attributed this expectation to Trump's personality and demeanor.\n\nHillary Clinton's loss is likely to spark bitter recriminations among Democrats, with the liberal faction, personified by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, pushing for radical change in the party agenda.\n\nTrump's victory represents a major change in GOP identity, focusing unabashedly on white Americans, contrary to the desires of party leadership, and rejecting mainstream Republican principles such as free trade. While this strategy won Trump the White House in 2016, the changing demographics of the U.S., with a fast-growing Hispanic population and a declining percentage of whites, may challenge the approach in coming years.\n\n\"It's not a good strategy in the long-term,\" noted Matthew Wilson, an associate professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, as Trump's victory hung in the balance.",
    " Title: Georgia and Virginia Loosen Gun Laws, See Decrease in Violent Crime, While Chicago Experiences Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to Chicago's recent surge in gun violence, states like Georgia and Virginia have been relaxing their gun control laws, with Georgia signing a bill this week to allow law-abiding residents to carry guns into taverns, churches, schools, and government buildings under certain circumstances. This move follows Virginia's decision four years ago to abolish its ban on guns in bars, which has reportedly led to a 5% decrease in violent crime at drinking establishments.\n\nChicago, known for some of the nation's toughest gun laws, has seen a spike in gun violence over the Easter weekend, with 40 persons shot, nine of whom fatally. Despite Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy's claim that the city's declining homicide tally is \"still ahead of where we were last year,\" with 415 homicides in 2013, down 18% from the year before, critics argue that the city's strict gun laws are ineffective.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court declared Chicago's 28-year-old handgun ban unconstitutional. A ban on gun sales was overturned in February, making Illinois the 50th state to enable residents to carry concealed weapons. However, the City Council and the Illinois legislature continue to discourage law-abiding citizens from defending themselves.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican, defends the new law, stating, \"This bill respects the rights of private-property owners, who still set the rules for their land and their buildings.\" Opponents of the expansion of gun rights predict that the Georgia law will lead to increased violence, but evidence from Virginia suggests otherwise.\n\nIn Virginia, when the Richmond Times-Dispatch investigated crimes committed by concealed-carry permit holders, it could only find one instance of a randy man with such a permit who had propositioned a waitress. Despite strict gun control measures, Washington D.C. counted 103 homicides in 2019, while Fairfax County, Alexandria, and Arlington County in Virginia reported eight, five, and zero homicides, respectively.\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has been criticized for his handling of gun violence in the city, may want to consider adopting Georgia and Virginia's approach to gun laws, as their relaxation seems to have led to a decrease in violent crime.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown Likely as Bipartisan Agreement Remains Elusive\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States federal government is on the brink of a shutdown, with no clear solution in sight. The House-passed bill, which failed to secure the necessary support, has left the government with less than twelve hours before a potential shutdown. As of Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Democratic counterpart, Chuck Schumer, have yet to discuss a plan B.\n\nThe most probable outcome at this point is a government shutdown, marking the first such occurrence since 2013. The impasse stems from a disagreement over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields undocumented children of immigrants from deportation. Democrats have demanded that any legislation addressing government funding also address DACA, while Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have refused to link the two issues.\n\nGiven the current dynamics, a short-term continuing resolution, providing only a temporary reprieve from a shutdown, seems unlikely to resolve the issue. The time crunch and the need to pass the bill through both the House and the Senate before midnight make this option challenging.\n\nDemocrats, who view DACA as their primary leverage, are reluctant to compromise. They believe they will bear the political advantage in the event of a shutdown, as the average American may question why the GOP, controlling the House, Senate, and White House, cannot maintain government operations. Additionally, Democratic lawmakers, particularly those eyeing the 2020 presidential race, must cater to their liberal base, which demands opposition to President Trump at all times.\n\nRepublicans, led by McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, are in a more compromising position due to the historical precedent of shutdowns not favoring their side if a deal is not reached by the deadline. The unpredictability of President Trump, as demonstrated by his Twitter activity, further complicates the process of negotiating and finalizing a deal.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, both parties are shifting their focus from finding a solution to avert a shutdown to preparing for the political fallout that may ensue. The White House's decision to hold a press briefing, featuring Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, suggests a pivot toward positioning for a likely shutdown. Momentum, a crucial factor in last-minute crises, currently favors a shutdown, with no obvious solution or interest in finding one on either side of the aisle.",
    " Title: Lawmakers, Aides Discuss Early Retirement Due to Obamacare Premium Hikes\n\nArticle:\n\nDozens of lawmakers and their aides are considering early retirement or resignation due to fears that their health insurance premiums will significantly increase next year as a result of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The concern stems from a provision in the health care law that will transition lawmakers and their staff onto the government health care exchanges, which could make their benefits excessively expensive due to the potential disappearance of government-subsidized premiums at the end of the year.\n\nDemocratic and Republican leaders are taking the issue seriously, but they are awaiting more specific guidance from the Office of Personnel Management on how the new rule should be implemented. Sources expect a decision by fall at the latest. The administration has remained silent on the matter in anticipation of a ruling.\n\nIf the issue remains unresolved, and a large number of lawmakers and aides choose to leave, there is a concern that this could lead to a \"brain drain\" as Congress tackles critical issues such as tax code reform and immigration reform. The problem is particularly acute in the House, where lawmakers and aides are generally younger and less wealthy. Several aides have already given notice that they will be leaving due to concerns about Obamacare.\n\nRep. John Larson (D-CT), a Connecticut Democrat in leadership when the law was passed, believes the problem will be resolved. \"If not, I think we should begin an immediate amicus brief to say, 'Listen, this is simply not fair to these employees,'\" Larson told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"They are federal employees.\"\n\nRepublicans, who have been critical of the Democratic health care reform, are more vocal about the potential negative effects of the provision. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) stated, \"It's a reality. This is the law.... It's going to hinder our ability with retention of members, it's going to hinder our ability for members to take care of their families.\" Sessions added that lawmakers are having \"quiet conversations\" about the threat.\n\nAlabama Rep. Jo Bonner noted that the threat is already real, especially for veteran lawmakers and staff. If they leave this year, they believe they can continue to be covered under the current health care plan. \"I've lost one staffer who told me in confidence that he had been here for a number of years and the thought of losing the opportunity to keep his health insurance on Dec. 31 [forced him to leave],\" said Bonner, who had already planned his resignation from Congress. \"And then I've got another staff member that I think it will be a factor as she's contemplating her future.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, contains a provision known as the Grassley Amendment. This provision states that the government can only offer members of Congress and their staff plans that are \"created\" in the bill or \"offered through an exchange\" unless the bill is amended. Currently, aides and lawmakers receive their health care under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which is subsidized by the government up to 75 percent of the premiums for the health insurance plans. In 2014, most Capitol Hill aides and lawmakers are expected to be put onto the exchanges, and there has been no guidance on whether the government will subsidize those premiums, which is expected to cause a steep increase in health insurance costs.",
    " Title: Conservative Group Criticizes McConnell for Fiscal Cliff Deal Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nA conservative advocacy group, ForAmerica, is targeting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell with a series of online ads in his home state, criticizing him for his role in negotiating the fiscal cliff deal. Brent Bozell, president of ForAmerica, stated, \"It's a statement we're making, and I suspect there will be more statements that are going to be coming out. It is a statement to make it emphatically clear that what the minority leader did was 100 percent unacceptable. Conservatives are going to hold him responsible for this.\"\n\nThe ads, with the headline \"Mitch McConnell: Whose side are you on?\", feature an image of a morose McConnell sandwiched between pictures of a smiling Vice President Joe Biden and a smirking President Barack Obama. The ad buy is reportedly a \"five-figure\" amount and will be distributed through Google display ads and Facebook in Kentucky, as well as run on The Daily Caller and Drudge Report in Washington.\n\nMcConnell is up for reelection in 2014 and is aiming to fend off a potential conservative primary challenge. After fiscal cliff negotiations between House Speaker John Boehner and Obama broke down, McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took over negotiations. McConnell called in Vice President Biden at the final minute when negotiations reached an impasse, and the McConnell-Biden framework became the basis for the deal.\n\nBozell, who vocally opposed the fiscal cliff deal that involved tax increases, made clear that his criticism is directed at McConnell for signing off on the deal. \"When Republicans agree to do what they did agree to do, then they are just as much tax-and-spend Democrats as Democrats are,\" Bozell said. \"Do I have any confidence that Republicans will stand by [McConnell's] statements a couple of days ago that the talk about tax increases are over? None,\" Bozell said. \"It is a fluid situation. There are some serious battles coming up. I'm not writing off anything. If Republicans find their mojo and rediscovered their soul and try to do the right thing, we'll support them, but they just can't count on us anymore.\"",
    " Title: Pennsylvania Voters Declare Hillary Clinton the Winner in Presidential Debate, Remain Pessimistic About Choices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a focus group of undecided voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton was declared the clear winner of the first presidential debate, but the participants expressed deep pessimism about their choices in November. The group, selected and paid to participate in a focus group conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in Philadelphia on Monday, described Clinton as \"liar,\" \"corrupt,\" \"secretive,\" and \"self-centered.\" Trump was labeled \"scary,\" \"fake,\" an \"egomaniac,\" and a \"shape-shifter.\"\n\nThe debate was watched from a room inside the National Constitution Center while Luntz's team tracked the voters' snap reactions throughout the 90-minute debate. At the end of the debate, 16 of the 27 participants agreed that Clinton had won, while just six believed Trump had won. In near uniformity, the voters said the outcome of the debate was the result of Trump's failure rather than Clinton's success.\n\nWhen asked to react to their performances, the voters offered that Trump's was \"strong start, weak finish,\" \"bombastic,\" \"sloppy,\" and \"verbose.\" When asked to respond to Clinton's performance, the answers were markedly positive: \"firm,\" \"powerful,\" \"strong,\" and \"informed.\"\n\nTrump struggled to defend himself against attacks by Clinton over his denigration of women, insensitivity on race relations, and an assertion that he avoided paying federal taxes for years. The freewheeling Republican nominee repeatedly interrupted Clinton and drew sardonic laughs from both the audience in New York and the voters in Pennsylvania, when he claimed to have a \"winning temperament.\"\n\nClinton wove the so-called birtherism issue into a larger narrative, accusing Trump of having \"a long record of engaging in racist behavior.\" As she spoke, many of the voters in the room agreed with her, especially among those already leaning towards her. After the debate, the voters lamented that too much time was spent discussing birtherism. Overall, the voters rated Clinton's response on issues of race higher than Trump's, and after the debate, several people flatly labeled the Republican nominee a racist.\n\nThe group included women and men who were reluctant to support either candidate, including a lifelong conservative voter who would rather sit out than vote for Trump, a millennial who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary but has been persuaded by Clinton, and a middle school teacher who says Trump \"lost\" her when he began denigrating Muslims.\n\nSome left the first debate impossibly conflicted and even more pessimistic than when they arrived. \"Hillary Clinton is not a good candidate and Donald Trump is just a despicable person,\" Nicole Gerson, an attorney in Philadelphia, reflected after the debate. She said Trump's criticism of Clinton steered her away from the Democrat but not in his direction. \"I'm actually thinking of voting for Gary Johnson,\" she said, naming the Libertarian candidate. \"Maybe the third party will finally become more viable so we're not left with such extreme candidates. It's a vote for the future.\"",
    " Title: Study Finds Facebook's Fact-Checking Efforts May Have Worsened Misinformation Problem\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) suggests that Facebook's efforts to combat fake news may have inadvertently worsened the problem. The study, which involved over 6,000 participants, found that the platform's use of fact-checking tags to flag inaccurate content may have led people to assume that unmarked content is accurate.\n\nDavid Rand, one of the authors of the report and a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, explained, \"Putting a warning on some content is going to make you think, to some extent, that all of the other content without the warning might have been checked and verified.\"\n\nThe study, dubbed the \"implied truth effect,\" suggests that the sheer scale of Facebook's platform, which has 1.25 billion daily users, and the amount of content posted on it, makes it impossible for fact-checkers to keep up.\n\nThe MIT team conducted studies with participants who were shown a variety of real and fake news headlines as they would appear on Facebook. One half of the group was shown stories without fact-checking tags of any sort, while the other half was shown a typical Facebook feed comprising a mixture of marked and unmarked posts. Participants were then asked if they believed the headlines were accurate.\n\nThe results found that the use of \"false\" tags that are used to flag inaccurate content did significantly reduce participants' willingness to share fake stories from 29.2% to 16.1%. However, the study also found that unmarked false stories were believed to be true and shared 36.2% of the time.\n\nOver one-fifth of the study's participants said they believed that the unmarked posts had already been fact-checked.\n\nRand, an unpaid advisor to Facebook's efforts to combat fake news, suggests one obvious fix is to employ more fact-checkers so that all news content posted to Facebook is checked. He also suggests that ordinary Facebook users could be recruited to do this work.\n\nWhile many people assume that allowing Facebook users to do this work would make the situation much worse, given the partisan nature of content already on the site, Rand's research has found the opposite. In fact, this is something Facebook is already considering. In December, it announced it would be hiring some part-time \"community reviewers\" who will help corroborate or debunk content flagged by the company's automated systems. Facebook did not respond to questions about the study's findings.\n\nRand suggests a potential solution is to put verification panels on content that fact-checkers find to be true, eliminating any ambiguity. \"If you see a story without a label, you know it simply hasn't been checked,\" he said.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Three Potential Vice Presidential Picks Ahead of Republican National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events on Monday, former President Donald Trump named three Republican politicians as potential vice-presidential picks for the party's national convention later this month in Cleveland. The named individuals are first-term Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, first-term Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, and Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence.\n\nTrump spent time with Pence and his family on Sunday and was due to meet Ernst in New Jersey on Monday. Ernst, endorsed by the Tea Party, won her Senate seat in 2014 with an ad featuring her background of growing up \"castrating hogs on an Iowa farm\" and her promise to \"know how to cut pork\" in Washington. In 2015, she delivered the Republican response to Barack Obama's State of the Union address.\n\nCotton, 39, has not been as often named among potential Trump's vice-presidential picks as Pence and Ernst. In his tweet, Trump praised Cotton for his performance on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, stating that despite a one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was \"solid.\"\n\nCotton gave little away in his NBC interview, saying Trump could \"make the case for himself\" as to why he should be president. He was more forthright in attacking Hillary Clinton, who he said had been \"responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration.\"\n\nTrump's note of complaint about Todd's questioning echoed another tweet sent on Monday, in which he blamed the \"dishonest media\" for a furor over a tweet he sent and then deleted on Saturday, which showed Clinton next to a six-pointed star against a background of dollar bills, prompting accusations of antisemitism. The image was later found by reporters on a white supremacist message board, in a post predating Trump's tweet.\n\nNewt Gingrich, who has repeatedly said he is open to being Trump's vice-presidential pick, may yet be considered too forthright. Last week, in words that echoed strongly on Monday in the controversy over Trump's Clinton tweet, he told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival: \"Trump's job is, frankly, to quit screwing up and get the election down to three or four big issues.\"\n\nThe New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama have also been reported to be under consideration. Trump has said the pick will likely be announced at the convention in Cleveland, which starts on 18 July, but some sources suggest he may announce sooner to help drum up excitement.\n\nAs evidence of his management of a process which generates relatively positive publicity, Trump also tweeted on Monday: \"The only people who are not interested in being the VP pick are the people who have not been asked!\"\n\nMany of the Republican party's biggest names are not willing to appear at the convention. The former presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush; the 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney; and the Ohio governor, John Kasich, all plan to avoid the four-day event.\n\nPossible speakers include the former Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight, the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and the boxing promoter Don King. \"I'm going to be involved, definitely,\" King, who lives in Cleveland, told the Associated Press. \"He's my man. I love him. He's going to be the next president.\"\n\nSome celebrities backing Trump have, however, passed on the convention. The Super Bowl-winning Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka told the Chicago Tribune last week: \"I spoke with Mr. Trump this afternoon, and he invited me. But I don't think I'm going to go.\"\n\nTrump's campaign has also been in touch with aides to the man who challenged him most strongly in the primary, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, who has reportedly been trying to win a speaking slot. Others under consideration include the former United Nations ambassador and sometime presidential hopeful John Bolton, the West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito, and the Washington representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\n\nGingrich, a likely convention speaker who also spoke to the AP, said Trump \"understands that if he can appeal to consumer America, he drowns political America.\" He also recalled a recent conversation with a Trump family member who confidently told him: \"We know how to do conventions.\"",
    " Title: White House Tensions Rise as 'Saturday Night Live' Spicer Skit Draws Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe portrayal of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in a recent 'Saturday Night Live' sketch has reportedly caused discomfort within the White House, with President Donald Trump and his team finding the gum-chomping, super soaker-wielding caricature of Spicer by actress Melissa McCarthy particularly problematic.\n\nSources close to the president have stated that Spicer's portrayal by a woman was most troubling for Trump, as it was seen as an unflattering send-up by a female comedian that could negatively impact Spicer's longevity in the high-profile role. The White House's discomfort was reportedly evident in Trump's uncharacteristic silence on Twitter over the weekend regarding the sketch.\n\nSean Spicer, for his part, attempted to downplay the impact of the sketch during an interview with Extra, joking about McCarthy's gum-chewing and suggesting that the attention from the sketch had helped him achieve a new level of fame.\n\nHowever, Spicer's allies are reportedly trying to put a positive spin on the incident, with one person close to Spicer stating, \"He takes the job seriously but does not take himself that seriously.\" This person also noted that the instant-viral skit had helped Spicer gain recognition.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spicer will face the press once again in the briefing room, where the 'SNL' skit is expected to be a significant topic of discussion. White House sources have suggested that Spicer will attempt to diffuse the tension with humor, as he has reportedly been on a charm offensive in recent days, reaching out to reporters to wish them happy birthdays and making self-effacing jokes during public appearances.\n\nSpicer has been struggling to repair his troubling first impression behind the lectern, as he is still operating under a cloud created by his initial false statements about the crowd size at Trump's inauguration. Internally, people close to Trump are eager to point out that Spicer was not Trump's first choice for the high-profile position of press secretary, but that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus pushed for Spicer to get the job.\n\nSpicer has taken the role seriously, participating in mock briefing sessions during the transition to prepare for his on-camera performances. Since January 20, Spicer has had the added difficulty of doing two jobs at once: acting as communications director in addition to his role as press secretary, while the administration seeks to fill the former position. Senior White House officials Kellyanne Conway and Hope Hicks still attend the daily briefings and sit on the side to watch Spicer, a move some interpreted as a sign that Spicer still needs supervision.\n\nThe 'SNL' clip was seen by some in Trump's orbit as devastating because it was considered an accurate portrayal of Spicer. One Trump ally stated, \"I thought they had Sean down pretty good.\" This individual also believed that Spicer had been set up in an impossible position.\n\nIn a phone interview on Monday afternoon, Spicer attempted to distance himself from the skit, stating, \"I would much rather have the focus be on the president's agenda and the success he's having.\" When pressed about his own reaction to the skit, Spicer demurred, stating, \"It doesn't really matter what I think.\"",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner's Struggle with Hard-Line Faction in Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown and its causes can be traced back to the influence of a group of approximately 30 hard-line House Republican members and their relationship with Speaker John Boehner.\n\nIn mid-September, Boehner stated, \"We have a diverse caucus,\" referring to the 233 members of the House Republican caucus, each with their individual plans. \"It's tough to get them on the same track. We got there.\" Boehner's original plan for a temporary government funding bill was abandoned due to the hard-liners' insistence on a more aggressive approach to defunding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe following day, Boehner held a rally in the Capitol, celebrating a government funding bill's passage that also defunded the health care law. Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, who was present at the rally, commented, \"I think the speaker is stronger today than he was yesterday. And he was stronger yesterday than he was the day before. If we continue in that direction, we're going to be in pretty good shape.\"\n\nDespite their constituents' conservative leanings, the hard-liners, who predominantly occupy safe seats in deep-red districts, face minimal pressure from their constituents. Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho, a freshman, stated, \"I come from a very conservative area, and my constituents are saying, 'Don't blink, don't cave in, don't back up.'\"\n\nThe question on everyone's mind in Washington is whether Boehner will ultimately bring up a \"clean CR\" \u2013 a short-term spending bill that the Senate passed with Obamacare funding intact. It is believed that this bill would pass easily on the House floor with a combination of Democratic and Republican votes. However, Indiana Republican Rep. Marlin Stutzman, another hard-liner, argues that passing a clean CR at this time would be detrimental to the Republican conference and weaken Boehner's negotiating ability in the future.\n\nBoston College political scientist David Hopkins suggests that the hard-liners' actions could potentially threaten Boehner's speakership, as they do not view him as one of their own and may attempt to depose him as speaker. The hard-liners' influence is amplified due to the relatively slim Republican majority in the House, and Hopkins estimates that there are at least 50 other Republicans who do not want any daylight between themselves and the hard-liners, fearing reprisal from outside activist groups or primary challenges.\n\nHopkins also notes that the remaining Republicans have not discouraged the hard-liners, and the hard-liners are often portrayed as the villains in the government shutdown story, with the rest of the Republican caucus being implicated in their strategy by going along with it. As long as the rest of the caucus continues to support the hard-liners, there is no reason to expect Boehner to deviate from their stance.",
    " Title: Freedom Caucus Threatens to Release Own Tax Reform Plan if White House Delays Action\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus leaders, including Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Vice Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), have warned White House officials that the conservative group may release its own tax reform plan if the White House does not present a plan soon. In a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, and White House legislative liaison Marc Short on Thursday, Meadows and Jordan expressed their concern about the lack of action on a tax reform plan.\n\nMeadows and Jordan delivered the message to Mnuchin, Cohn, and Short that Republicans need to release a tax plan soon, or the Freedom Caucus may put out its own legislation. The White House officials are reportedly concerned that the Freedom Caucus releasing its own plan would prevent Republicans from uniting behind one plan.\n\nMeadows downplayed the possibility that the group would release its own legislation, stating that the White House has assured him that action is imminent. However, if the White House does not take action soon, the Freedom Caucus may release its own plan. Meadows added that every day that goes by, there is less of a chance of getting a tax reform bill passed before the end of the year.\n\nThe White House officials would prefer to avoid dealing with dissent from the Freedom Caucus. However, they are also concerned about keeping conservatives in the fold after President Trump cut a budget deal this week with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), startling his own party.\n\nThe tax reform debate is ongoing between the House and the Senate, with debates still ongoing on specifics, including whether to allow immediate business expensing and deciding how much the corporate tax rate can be lowered. Trump has repeatedly pushed for a 15 percent rate, but some of his top advisers say it is not mathematically possible.\n\nThe possibility of the Freedom Caucus going rogue on tax reform petrifies administration and Capitol Hill Republicans working on the issue. GOP leaders believe that a single, unified tax bill backed by Trump, the House, and the Senate is critical to success. The White House has been meeting weekly with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), along with the GOP chairmen of the House and Senate tax panels, known as the Big Six.\n\nConservatives also want a seat at the table and are eager to see a plan and influence the text. There is a palpable fear that the Big Six will release a plan and try to jam conservatives, just as they did with health care. Meadows stated that the White House and the speaker's conversations are about making decisions and starting debates on the merits of rates and expensing models, rather than allowing the Big Six to negotiate something and then giving everyone a binary choice.\n\nConservatives are desperate for a win to show to constituents back home. Meadows ticked off six major tax reform questions that have not been answered, including the exact corporate tax rate and how business expensing will be handled. Meadows stated that if they cannot answer these questions, then they do not have any idea what they are doing on tax reform.\n\nMeadows stated that there are several Freedom Caucus members crafting tax legislation. Axios reported earlier this week that one such plan would lower the corporate tax rate to 16 percent, a much more aggressive cut than the Big Six believes Congress can achieve. However, the meeting appears to have persuaded conservatives to hold off\u2014at least for now.\n\nMeadows stated that the only way a plan from the Freedom Caucus would be introduced is if there is inaction on behalf of the Big Six, and they are still talking about principles weeks from now. Meadows argued that there is no need for his group to drop a plan at the moment, as long as the Big Six puts out a bill and negotiates in good faith over the next few weeks. Meadows added that he is not saying that he will never put out a bill, but as long as they put out a bill and negotiate in good faith, there will be no need for a Freedom Caucus bill.",
    " Title: California and New Jersey Primaries Yield Mixed Results for Democrats, Republicans Advance in Key Races\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the primary elections held in eight U.S. states on Tuesday, California and New Jersey emerged as key battlegrounds, with Democrats aiming to flip Republican-held seats in the upcoming midterm elections. The unique electoral system in California, where the top two vote-getters advance to the election regardless of party, raised concerns for Democrats in conservative suburbs south of Los Angeles.\n\nIn some areas, the large number of Democratic candidates risked splitting the party's vote, though the same quirk also threatened to eliminate Republican John Cox from the race for Governor. In the end, Democratic candidates managed to advance, as did Cox.\n\nDemocrats, buoyed by President Donald Trump's poor approval ratings and a string of victories in special elections, hope to gain a majority in the 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives by flipping 23 seats this fall. The party has targeted more than a dozen Republican-held seats in California and New Jersey alone.\n\nControl of the House would likely stall much of Republican President Donald Trump's policy agenda, while ushering in a new era of committee oversight and investigation into the administration. A power shift would also lend strength to any potential effort to impeach Trump if Democrats decide grounds exist, either by virtue of the ongoing probe into Russian election interference by special counsel Robert Mueller or other reasons.\n\nCalifornia is seen as key to the eventual outcome in November. Democrats have taken aim at 10 of the 14 House seats held by Republicans. However, strong turnouts by Republican voters in all of the districts underscore the challenges that Democrats will face in trying to win in the conservative areas that they have targeted in suburban areas near Los Angeles and Sacramento, and in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley.\n\nThe battle for a place on the final ballot was particularly dramatic in the 48th Congressional District, where voters chose Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in the 2016 presidential election but re-elected longtime Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher. So many Democrats were vying to challenge Rohrabacher that they divided their party's vote. With 414 of 415 precincts reporting early Wednesday, Rohrabacher easily won a spot on the November ballot. Two Democrats, Harley Rouda and Hans Keirstead, were next, separated by fewer than 100 votes, leaving the race too close to call. About 1,000 votes behind the two Democrats was Republican Scott Baugh. If the final tally puts him ahead of them, it could set up a general election fight between Rohrabacher and his fellow Republican, ending Democrats' chances to take that seat.\n\nIn the race for Governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom's first-place finish over a field of 27 candidates was expected. However, Republican John Cox's presence as the second candidate to advance to the November ballot could color the race. Republicans hope he will spur supporters to come out and vote in greater numbers, possibly improving the party's chances in Congressional races.\n\nIn New Jersey, establishment-backed Democrats muscled past liberal challengers in key New Jersey congressional races on Tuesday, setting up contests in November that will test the question of whether more moderate candidates will fare better against Republicans in swing districts.\n\nIn southern New Jersey, where the retirement of a longtime Republican incumbent gave Democrats an opening, state Sen. Jeff Van Drew, a conservative Democrat, appeared set to prevail over left-leaning candidates frustrated by his past votes against same-sex marriage and minimum wage increases. He will face Republican Seth Grossman, a former city and county official, who emerged from a four-way contest.\n\nIn a suburban New Jersey district, former Obama official Tom Malinowski was well ahead of two Democrats backed by independent liberal groups and will take on the moderate Republican Leonard Lance in what is expected to be a competitive race. Democrats also hope to capture two other Republican-held seats in the state.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers of Congress. While Democrats need only a net total of two seats to take command of the Senate, Democratic senators must defend a bevy of seats in rural states such as Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, and West Virginia that supported Trump two years ago.\n\nVoters on Tuesday also went to the polls to choose candidates in primaries in Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama, Montana, South Dakota, and New Mexico. A number of women won Democratic contests, continuing a trend that began earlier this year. Women will represent the party in key House races in Iowa, New Jersey, and New Mexico, based on Tuesday's results.",
    " Title: Hagel Acknowledges Possible Ground Force Recommendation in Iraq, Obama Maintains No Change in Stance on U.S. Combat Troops\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel has indicated that he may consider recommendations to deploy ground forces in Iraq to assist local forces in locating targets, contingent upon a recommendation from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey. However, Hagel emphasized that these forces would not be fighting forces, and there will be no American combat troops in Iraq or Syria.\n\nPresident Obama reiterated during the G20 summit in Australia that he has not changed his mind about U.S. ground forces in Iraq. He does not plan to deploy them, and Dempsey has not advised him to send U.S. troops to fight. However, the President did not rule out the possibility of deploying ground troops in the most dire of circumstances, such as if ISIL obtained a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Hagel declined to comment on whether any top members of the Khorasan Group have been killed by U.S. airstrikes in Syria, but stated that the group still poses a significant threat.\n\nThe seminar on national security strategy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, was attended by Hagel, Republican Sen. John McCain, former defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The issue of a strategy to combat ISIS dominated several panel discussions.\n\nIn a blistering critique of President Barack Obama and the Pentagon, Sen. McCain stated, \"No one outside the Joint Chiefs of Staff believes we have a strategy\" to defeat and degrade ISIS, as set forth by the administration. Former defense secretaries Panetta and Gates have recently published books that criticize Obama. In his remarks, Gates likened Obama to President Lyndon B. Johnson in what he called \"micromanagement\" of military policy and targeting during the Vietnam War. Jeh Johnson stated that the potential for a lone wolf attack inspired by ISIS was a primary concern.",
    " Title: Rep. Rashida Tlaib Announces Impeachment Resolution for President Trump, Contrary to House Leadership's Position\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has announced her plans to file a resolution to impeach President Donald Trump, a move that breaks ranks with House leadership. On Wednesday, Tlaib, a freshman progressive, made the \"emergency\" announcement surrounded by a group of supporters who wore shirts and held signs with statements such as \"He's a Racist\" and \"#TimeToImpeach.\"\n\nTlaib stated, \"We want to be able to work on these economic justice issues, racial justice issues, and everything. But guess what? There is a wall there, and a constitutional crisis that is not going to be able to have us be able to do our jobs as American Congress members to push a lot of these agendas forward.\" She argued that the last election was a calling, and the American people wanted to elect the jury that would begin the impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\nIn an attempt to maintain party unity, Tlaib argued that her party agrees the president needs to be impeached. \"This is not to say that we disagree. I think that every single colleague of mine agrees there are impeachable offenses. That's one thing we all agree on,\" Tlaib continued. \"We may disagree on the pace. We may disagree that we have to wait on certain hearings, but at the same time, I think they all know the dangers of allowing President Trump to continue to violate our United States Constitution.\"\n\nDemonstrators went to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office to push for her support. Tlaib's decision to file the motion is contrary to the desire of Pelosi and other senior Democrat leaders. The Washington Examiner reports that Democrat Caucus Chair, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), called the announcement \"premature.\"\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has continually pushed back on the notion that the Democrats' priority is impeachment.

In a February interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Pelosi shared her concerns about impeachment, finding the process to be \"disruptive\" to the nation.\n\nTlaib's move comes at a divisive time in the Democrat Party, as House Democrats attempt to establish a measure addressing recent anti-Semitic remarks from freshman Democrats Rep.

    " Title: Immigration Reform Returns to Forefront as GOP Responds to Record Hispanic Voter Turnout\n\nArticle:\n\nTop Republicans have signaled a renewed interest in immigration reform, a shift that has not been seen in five years. This sudden focus on immigration, which has been on the legislative back burner for years, highlights the concern among Republicans about the potential loss of Latino voters.\n\nThe possibility of enacting a comprehensive overhaul remains uncertain due to deep-rooted opposition within the GOP to creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. However, the renewed focus on the issue suggests a significant change in the Republican party's approach, a shift that was not anticipated even a few months ago.\n\nKansas Sen. Jerry Moran, who is running for the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairmanship, stated, \"It's clear to me, if Republicans are going to have the opportunity to be in the majority, we clearly have to determine how we deal with minority and Latino voters. In some fashion, the way we have dealt with immigration gives us a black eye. And we need to figure out how to talk about issues and pursue policies that matter to Latino, Hispanic voters.\"\n\nRepublicans are not the only ones under pressure. Latino leaders expect President Barack Obama to deliver on a promise he failed to fulfill in his first term. Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union and a leader of Latino mobilization in battleground states, said, \"The Latino giant is wide awake, cranky and taking names.\"\n\nPresident Obama is expected to pursue a broad immigration reform proposal early next year, according to Democratic officials. Obama had promised to introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill during his first year in office but did not follow through due to a lack of Republican support. Facing pressure from the Latino community to show progress on the issue, Obama took executive action last summer to allow certain young immigrants to stay in the country.\n\nVice President Joe Biden expressed optimism about immigration reform, stating, \"I feel very optimistic about, in my view, immigration reform.\"",
    " Title: White House Withholds Email Regarding Susan Rice's Benghazi Talking Points, Citing Non-Relation to Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House admitted on Wednesday that it withheld an email from Congress and the media regarding Susan Rice's \"talking points\" about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, because the memo did not deal directly with the attack.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney stated, \"This document was explicitly not about Benghazi, but about the general dynamic in the Muslim world at the time.\"\n\nA government watchdog group obtained an email this week that reveals direct White House involvement in shaping the administration's message about the September 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.\n\nThe internal email, sent on September 14, 2012, was from Ben Rhodes, President Obama's assistant and deputy national security adviser, to White House press officials. In the email, Mr. Rhodes listed as a \"goal\" the White House's desire \"To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.\"\n\nThe email, titled \"RE: PREP CALL with Susan, Saturday at 4:00 pm ET,\" covered White House involvement in preparing Rice, then-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, for her upcoming appearance on Sunday television talk shows.\n\nThe email and others provide the clearest evidence to date that top presidential aides sought to use anti-American protests sweeping across the Middle East in 2012\u2014as well as the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attack\u2014to project an image of President Obama's foreign policy as \"steady and statesmanlike,\" just weeks before his re-election.\n\nMr. Carney stated that the White House withheld the Rhodes memo from congressional and media inquiries because \"it was explicitly not about Benghazi.\"\n\n\"The overall issue of unrest in the Muslim world and the danger posed by these protests... was very much a topic in the news,\" Mr. Carney said. At the time, protests in Egypt and elsewhere were directed at the U.S. over an anti-Muslim video produced in America.\n\nUnder the heading \"Goals\" for Rice's appearance on five Sunday talk shows, Mr. Rhodes wrote to other White House communications officials that a main objective of Rice's interviews should be to \"reinforce the president and the administration's strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges.\"\n\nA second goal was to link the Benghazi attack\u2014and those on other diplomatic sites across the Middle East\u2014to an obscure anti-Muslim video and to insist that the protests were not \"rooted\" in a \"broader failure of [administration] policy.\"",
    " Title: Unemployment Claims Reach 17 Million in Three Weeks; Senate Republicans Push for Small Business Aid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a span of three weeks, nearly 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. In California this week, a long line of individuals waited in the rain for food, a scene repeated in other states. Many states are struggling to keep up with the influx of unemployment requests.\n\n\"How long it takes will vary by states,\" said Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia. In Washington on Thursday, Senate Republicans pushed for an additional $250 billion to help small businesses in dire need.\n\n\"We need more funding, and we need it fast,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) during a speech on the floor. However, Democrats blocked the aid, demanding a $500 billion bill to offer more to health care providers and state and local governments.\n\n\"This was in fact, designed to fail, designed as a political stunt,\" argued Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) from the Senate floor.\n\nThere is now fear the unemployment rate could hit 15% soon, and White House officials, eager to stave off a severe recession, say companies in certain parts of the country that are free from outbreaks could reopen in May. However, the decision to restart the economy is largely out of the federal government's hands as many governors have issued stay-at-home orders through the end of May or later.\n\n\"We're at the top of the hill. Pretty sure we're at the top of the hill, and now we're going downward. In some cases, we've already started that process,\" said President Trump Thursday during his daily coronavirus briefing from the White House briefing room.\n\nHealth officials say social isolation methods are working. Dr. Anthony Fauci now predicts the American death toll will be 60,000, which is down from the earlier, more dire, predictions of 100,000 to 240,000.\n\n\"We have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again that we have in place a very aggressive and effective way to identify, isolate, contact, trace,\" Dr. Fauci told CBS News.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators is calling on China to immediately close all wet markets where fresh meat and produce is sold in unsanitary conditions.

    " Title: Obama Vows to Take Executive Action on Immigration Despite Congressional Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, during a diplomatic trip to Asia, reaffirmed his commitment to taking executive action on immigration reform, despite opposition from Congress. At a joint news conference with Myanmar dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Obama stated that Congress has the ability to address the issue, but not the power to expect the system to remain broken indefinitely.\n\nObama emphasized that the immigration issue has been stalled for over a decade and that he intends to act before the end of the year on proposals that may include extending amnesty and work permits to potentially millions of illegal immigrants. The president noted that he had given the House over a year to at least give a vote on the Senate bill, but they failed to do so.\n\nRepublicans have threatened that Obama's decision to act will lead to an adversarial relationship with Congress. House Speaker John Boehner stated that if the president continues down this path, Republicans will fight him tooth and nail. The Washington Post reported that Boehner warned, \"This is the wrong way to govern. This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they did not want.\"\n\nIn response, Obama warned Republicans against an approach to governance where disagreement on a single issue becomes a deal-breaker on every issue. He stated, \"Democracy cannot work that way. There will always be some differences.\"\n\nThe president also reiterated a previous promise that if congressional Republicans put forward a reform proposal, he will revoke any executive actions he has put into effect.\n\nAs Republicans grapple with a strategy to derail the president's plans, a rift is developing within the party about the best way forward. At least 50 conservative lawmakers are pushing to leverage the upcoming spending bill to force Obama to stand down. Their plan is to stipulate in the legislation that the president cannot act unilaterally, an approach that would likely trigger a government shutdown when the president refuses to capitulate.\n\nThe leadership has not yet developed a clear alternative other than ruling out the possibility of a shutdown. One option they are considering is to allow the executive action to take effect but work to undermine its provisions incrementally over the coming months. A lawsuit over the president's misuse of his authority is also an idea that has been floated.\n\nAccording to reports, the president has not yet decided the timing for his announcement, but The New York Times reported Thursday that Obama may announce his planned action as soon as next week. Final decisions about the details of the plan have not been made, but by some accounts, a proposal may grant amnesty to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants. Officials said it could also authorize amnesty for parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents and give them the right to obtain work documents.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats and immigration rights supporters are pushing for Obama to extend amnesty to as many migrants as possible. In recent days, they have been rallying behind the president's decision to take action, saying it is not out of step with other presidents who have acted unilaterally on major issues. The Washington Post reported.",
    " Title: Fiscal Cliff Negotiations and the U.S. Budget Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing negotiations to avert the Fiscal Cliff are generating significant political drama, but they may not resolve Washington's budget woes and could potentially lead the nation into another recession or worse. The Budget Act of 2011 mandates a nine-year $1.2 trillion deficit reduction program, or equal cuts in annual defense and non-entitlement outlays totaling $54.7 billion, set to take effect on January 1. Simultaneously, the Bush Tax cuts, the 2 percentage point payroll tax holiday, and other programs expire.\n\nThe combined annual spending reductions and additional taxes could trigger severe economic consequences, including unemployment surpassing 15 percent, state government financial collapse, homeowner mortgage defaults, and the failure of hundreds of banks. To prevent catastrophe, President Obama and House Republicans are expected to agree on raising taxes on high-income Americans by $100 to $150 billion and reducing spending by an equal amount. However, these efforts may still not be sufficient, and the economy could still slip into recession, depriving the federal government of tax revenues and further increasing the budget gap.\n\nThe federal deficit currently exceeds $1 trillion, up from $161 billion in 2007, the last year before the financial collapse. Spending has increased by approximately $1 trillion, as outlays for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other entitlements have increased by an amount equivalent to the entire 2013 defense budget. By the end of the decade, runaway entitlement spending will require significant cuts to the military or crippling many other domestic spending programs to prevent ballooning deficits.\n\nThe only reasonable solution to address the growing entitlement spending is to raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 and pattern U.S. healthcare reforms after other national systems that better control costs. The Germans and Dutch spend one-third less on healthcare than the United States, as their governments more aggressively regulate prices, better ration care, and spend less on lawsuits.\n\nDemocrats, constrained by unions, are reluctant to require Americans to work longer, and are too beholden to tort lawyers and the medical establishment for campaign support, resulting in ObamaCare's additional funding to a broken system rather than addressing the root causes of rising healthcare costs. Republicans refuse to acknowledge more competition as a solution, arguing that there is already sufficient competition among providers, drug and device manufacturers, and insurance companies, and that it will not adequately slow the rise in healthcare costs.\n\nOver the next decade, without a significantly higher retirement age, effective price controls in healthcare, and tort reform, federal spending and the national debt will skyrocket. Mounting interest payments, investor reluctance to buy U.S. Treasurys, and consequent draconian cuts in spending will thrust the United States into the crisis now gripping Greece and Spain.\n\nMore immediately, even modest tax increases and spending cuts threaten a second recession, as President Obama and Congress have failed to address the dysfunctions that created the bubble and bust of the 2000s and made the economy overly dependent on deficit spending. From 2001 to 2005, the trade deficit doubled to over $700 billion, due to subsidized imports from China, restrictions on U.S. sales into the Middle Kingdom, and rising oil prices. This resulting loss of demand for U.S.-made goods and services should have instigated a recession; however, Chinese and Middle East oil exporters stepped up purchases of U.S. securities, helping finance questionable mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt. Americans spent more than they earned, and the boom continued into 2007. When homeowners and other borrowers could no longer service their debts, defaults and bankruptcies resulted, and the economy crashed.\n\nA huge trade deficit with China and on oil continues, but now the federal government is doing the extra spending and borrowing for us. If budget negotiations reduce the deficit by $200 to $300 billion, as is likely, GDP will contract $350 to 500 billion, and unemployment will rise above 10 percent. President Obama and House Republicans indicate no interest in confronting Beijing to force a more equitable trading relationship with the Middle Kingdom. Slashing oil imports requires the President to permit more drilling in the Gulf, off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in Alaska, and for Republicans to embrace alternative energy sources and more aggressive conservation measures.\n\nIn summary, absent major changes in trade and energy policies to boost domestic demand and growth, budget deficit reduction is not possible without another long, hard recession. And absent genuine deficit reduction, the country is headed for economic chaos by the end of the decade.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Abortion Access in Louisiana, but Roberts' Ruling May Signal Future Erosion of Roe v. Wade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling announced on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, preserving the court's precedents and protecting abortion access. However, the outcome is not an unalloyed endorsement of a constitutional right to choose, as Chief Justice John Roberts' reasoning in the case, June Medical Services v. Russo, may signal a future erosion, if not outright reversal, of Roe v. Wade.\n\nLegal writer Mark Joseph Stern, in an article for Slate, argues that the Supreme Court's ruling in June Medical Services is not as favorable to abortion rights as it may initially appear. The outcome is, indisputably, a triumph for Louisiana's three remaining clinics, which can now remain open thanks to the Supreme Court. However, Roberts' opinion itself is far from an unalloyed endorsement of a constitutional right to choose. In fact, the chief justice cut back protections for women seeking abortions and laid the groundwork for a future erosion, if not outright reversal, of Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling in June Medical Services is similar to its 2016 ruling in the case Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which struck down a similar law in Texas. In Whole Woman's Health, the Court ruled that Texas' admitting privileges law imposed an 'undue burden' on the constitutional right to abortion. Since Louisiana's law is indistinguishable from Texas's, it should have been plainly unconstitutional under Whole Woman's Health. However, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals effectively defied precedent by upholding the Louisiana regulation.\n\nSome major changes on the U.S. Supreme Court have occurred since 2016. Former Justice Anthony Kennedy, a right-wing libertarian, is no longer on the Court, which now includes two nominees of President Donald Trump: Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch. The big question in June Medical was whether Roberts, who dissented in Whole Woman's Health, would nonetheless invalidate Louisiana's law on the grounds of stare decisis, or respect for precedent. And that's exactly what Roberts did\u2014with a catch. The Court actually splintered 4-1-4: Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the four liberals, the chief justice wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, and the four other conservatives dissented.\n\nAlthough Roberts supported Breyer's bottom-line holding, he declined to join Breyer's opinion. Because the chief justice's opinion is narrower than Breyer's, it is 'controlling'\u2014that is, it's the law of the land. Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate will thus be scrutinizing Roberts' concurrence for years to come. And it gives both sides reason for encouragement.\n\nAccording to Stern, Roberts' decision in June Medical does not necessarily mean that Roe v. Wade will not be overturned at some point. In short, Roberts\u2014alone among the conservatives\u2014agreed with the liberals that Louisiana cannot pretend its law creates no real burden for abortion patients in the face of ample evidence that it would shutter clinics. However, the chief justice then whittled down the holding of Whole Woman's Health, replacing its balancing test with a stingier rule that may give states broader leeway to restrict abortion. Roberts expressly disavowed Breyer's test, which weighed a law's benefits to patients against its burdens.",
    " Title: New Pass-Through Tax Loophole in GOP Tax Bill Favors Wealthy, Costs Government Billions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe new pass-through tax loophole in the recently passed Republican tax bill has come under scrutiny for its potential impact on the government's revenue and the distribution of benefits. The loophole, which allows for a 20% deduction on pass-through business income, is estimated to cost the government $414.5 billion in lost revenue over a decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nThis figure is significant, as it is approximately 29 times the annual federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which covers nearly nine million children from low-income families. The program's authorization lapsed at the end of September.\n\nThe pass-through tax provision has been a point of contention, with some arguing that it was not intended to win over the vote of Senator Bob Corker, who has a real estate partnership in Tennessee. Corker, whose party can only afford to lose two votes, has become more influential in the tax bill's passage due to Senator John McCain's absence due to the aftereffects of his cancer treatment.\n\nRepublican leaders and Mr. Corker himself have stated that the provision was not inserted during conference committee negotiations as a \"airdropped\" measure, as Mr. Corker described it. They argue that the main purpose of the provision is to ensure that pass-through businesses are not unfairly treated compared to corporations, which will receive a significant tax cut from 35% to 21%.\n\nPresident Trump has stated that the tax bill would \"cost me a fortune\" and that his accountants are \"going crazy now.\" However, this claim has been labeled as \"fake news\" by fact-checkers. With the new loophole, the argument for this claim becoming more nonsensical.\n\nThe tax bill's generosity towards real estate titans stands in stark contrast to its stinginess towards the average wage earner. Average wage earners who would initially receive modest tax cuts would see these benefits disappear after 2025. Additionally, homeowners and others in high-cost states like California, New Jersey, and New York would see their once-substantial deductions for state and local taxes shrink to a maximum of $10,000 a year, which could potentially reduce home values.\n\nFurthermore, the tax bill would permanently change how tax brackets are adjusted for inflation, causing more people to be pushed into higher tax brackets over time even if they received only modest raises in salary.",
    " Title: Alternative Media Scenario: Trump's Post-Election Evolution and Media Coverage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an alternate universe, the media's coverage of Donald Trump after his election mirrors the sympathetic treatment given to Barack Obama. President-elect Trump has shown a surprising inclusiveness in reaching out to former critics, such as Mitt Romney, Nikki Haley, and Rick Perry.\n\nTrump has temporarily ceased his rhetorical war on the media, even engaging with The New York Times, describing the newspaper as a \"jewel.\" The President-elect has demonstrated flexibility in reconsidering some campaign promises, abandoning his support for waterboarding, expressing an open mind on climate change, and maintaining key parts of Obamacare.\n\nThe media's portrayal of Trump's evolution has been met with mixed reactions. Some view it as a positive development, while others see it as a series of flip-flops. A Politico headline reads, \"15 Trump Flip-Flops in 15 Days.\" The media's initial shock at Trump's victory has led to a lack of benefit of the doubt, with few expecting him to win.\n\nOne area of focus has been the disappointment on the right after the \"Lock Her Up\" rallies. Breitbart ran a \"Broken Promise\" headline, while cable news segments debate whether Hillary Clinton should be prosecuted or not. Similarly, Trump's evolving views on various issues have been either downplayed or praised, with CNN's Fareed Zakaria writing, \"One might wonder why he didn't have that conversation during the campaign or why he pounded home the opposite views on all these topics for a year and a half. But at this point, it doesn't matter. Trump is president-elect. We should all hope that he flip-flops some more.\"\n\nFrom the right, Trump critic Kathleen Parker criticizes Trump's campaign promises, labeling them as lies. However, she admits to being happier with his new positions. Trump's efforts to bring establishment Republicans into his administration have received some media credit, with the media focusing on the potential derailment of Mitt Romney's nomination as secretary of State and the controversy surrounding Nikki Haley's appointment as U.N. ambassador.\n\nThe media has also addressed questions surrounding Trump's potential conflicts of interest due to his real estate empire and the role of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in his administration. The New York Times ran a lengthy story on the former, while the latter's lack of government or diplomatic experience is a topic of discussion.\n\nThe media has also covered the debate over a recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, with Trump dismissing it as a \"scam\" and criticizing the Clinton campaign for cooperating. However, the recount will not change the inauguration's presiding party.\n\nIn conclusion, the media's coverage of Donald Trump's post-election evolution has been a subject of debate, with some viewing it as a positive development and others seeing it as a series of flip-flops. The relationship between the media and the President-elect should always be adversarial, but the media's coverage of Trump is not as sympathetic as it was for President-elect Obama.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Same-sex Marriage: Implications for Religious and LGBT Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot ban same-sex marriage, establishing a new civil right and marking a significant victory for gay and lesbian advocates. The ruling, however, has sparked concerns among religious groups, who argue that their religious freedoms may be at risk.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, speaking after the ruling, acknowledged the deep-seated beliefs of those who oppose same-sex marriage. He emphasized the importance of religious freedom, stating that those beliefs should remain protected as part of the country's commitment to religious freedom.\n\nThe decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, briefly acknowledged the right of faith groups to object to same-sex marriage. However, more conservative justices and several religious groups criticized the decision for not addressing the First Amendment's \"free exercise\" clause, which they argue encompasses not just preaching and teaching, but also the \"free exercise\" of faith in various activities, including religious ceremonies, charitable works, and business operations.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in his dissent, argued that the majority's nod towards religious liberty was a \"weak gesture,\" and that the ruling could have \"ruinous consequences.\" He suggested that conflicts between competing definitions of marriage, particularly in terms of religious ceremonies, would arise.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia also expressed concerns about the potential impact of the ruling on religious institutions. They raised questions about the future of religious colleges, faith-based adoption agencies, and the potential loss of tax exemptions for organizations that conflict with the new right to same-sex marriage.\n\nArchbishop William Lori of Baltimore, representing the U.S. Catholic bishops, stated that the ruling would affect \"thousands\" of state and local statutes across the country and could lead to \"a lot of legal controversies in terms of the way we organize and run our ministries.\"\n\nEvangelical groups, who make up about 25% of the country's population, have also pledged to fight the legal implications of the ruling. They expressed concerns about the potential coercion or infringement upon the rights of institutions to live by their sacred beliefs about marriage and sexuality.\n\nThe skirmish over religious and LGBT rights is expected to continue, with both sides anticipating legal battles in the coming years. The outcome remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the battle lines have been drawn, and the fight for religious and LGBT rights will likely continue to shape American society in the years to come.",

The expected grand jury decision, initially anticipated as early as this weekend, has been delayed until Monday at the earliest, according to a federal law enforcement official who spoke to a media outlet on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter.\n\nProtesters took to the streets again Saturday evening, chanting slogans such as \"No justice, no peace\" and \"Mike Brown means, we've got to fight back.\" They gathered at the Ferguson police station before moving back into the street when police in riot gear appeared. Two people were arrested for unlawful assembly, according to St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman.\n\nAuthorities have set up barricades around the building where the grand jury has been meeting, as well as in a shopping center parking lot where police established a makeshift command center following Brown's death.\n\nPolice and protesters are planning ahead. Police leaders have met five times with some protest group leaders, resulting in them agreeing to 11 rules of engagement, such as avoiding the use of excessive force and communicating to de-escalate tense situations.\n\nPresident Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have called for people to temper their reactions. The president spoke during an ABC News interview, saying people who were upset should not use the grand jury's decision as \"an excuse for violence.\" Holder urged law enforcement officials to minimize the potential for confrontations during demonstrations.\n\nMichael Brown's father has also joined in the call for calm. In a video statement released Thursday, he said, \"We are hurting... But hurting others and destroying property is not the answer.\"\n\nIf violence or unrest does erupt, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon will call in the National Guard. He declared a state of emergency earlier this week.\n\nSome schools in the area are preparing for what comes next.

    " Title: Socialist Economic Model: Allocating Capital and Addressing Social Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nThe discussion revolves around the concept of a socialist economic model, focusing on the allocation of capital and its role in addressing social issues. The objective is to create a system that strengthens equality rather than undermining it.\n\nOne proposed solution is the establishment of sectoral councils. In this model, instead of firms competing within a sector, workers from the firms elect representatives to a sectoral council. These councils would be responsible for planning the sector as a whole, with the aim of raising productivity and quality in every firm. Capital would be distributed within the sector to meet the overall plans, promoting equality and productivity.\n\nCentralized research and development is another aspect of this model, ensuring that all sectors have access to the same resources for innovation. This approach introduces an additional layer of planning, separate from the central planning board, allowing for planning at the sectoral, regional, and firm levels.\n\nEconomist Friedrich Hayek argues that capitalism is the only system capable of revealing latent information and capacities through markets. However, the counterargument is that capitalism, under its current system, systematically hides information due to the benefits of private property and competition. Socialism, in this context, is seen as a means to share information more openly.\n\nHayek's argument about the capacities of capitalism is acknowledged, but it is argued that he overlooks the potential of ordinary people. The proponents of socialism argue that it is concerned not just with the capacities of entrepreneurs, but with the capacity of learners, enabling workers to develop and utilize their skills effectively.\n\nThe productivity growth in capitalism is typically around 1-2 percent, with the argument being that capitalism incentivizes higher productivity. However, it is suggested that workers, given the opportunity, could come up with ideas to improve productivity that could match or even surpass this rate. The benefits of such an approach would extend beyond productivity, proponents argue.",
    " Title: Kobe Bryant's Helicopter Granted Special Flight Clearance Despite Bad Weather Conditions, Officials Say\n\nArticle:\n\nThe helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant, his daughter, and seven others that crashed in California on Sunday was reportedly given a special flight clearance to fly through dense fog, despite the poor weather conditions. The New York Times reported Monday, citing audio records between the pilot and Burbank Airport's air traffic control, that the helicopter was cleared to fly through fog from Orange County toward the Los Angeles area, allowing it to enter Burbank airspace.\n\nHowever, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) official told The Times that the special clearance would have only allowed the pilot to fly around Burbank and Van Nuys but not from there onto Calabasas. The FAA official stated that a pilot is responsible for determining whether it is safe to fly in current and expected conditions, and for determining flight visibility. It would have been up to the pilot to determine that the weather was good enough to fly.\n\nLos Angeles police Sgt. Yvette Tuning, LAPD's Air Support Division Watch commander when the crash occurred, told The Times that police helicopters don't tend to fly under such conditions. She said while the weather has been good most of the winter, she knew that police helicopters were not going to operate in the fog that overtook the Los Angeles basin.\n\nOfficials in Los Angeles said late Sunday that dense fog likely played a role in the crash. Several experts pointed to the poor flying conditions in the area and said fog will likely play a key part in the investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office announced three bodies were recovered from the scene but have not identified the remains. The Sikorsky S-76 helicopter went down in Calabasas, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said in a Sunday afternoon press conference there were nine people listed on the helicopter's manifest and all were believed to be dead. Federal transportation safety investigators were on their way to the scene. Among other things, they will look at the pilot's history, the chopper's maintenance records, and the records of its owner and operator, said NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy at a news conference.\n\nThe helicopter left Santa Ana in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, shortly after 9 a.m. and circled for a time just east of Interstate 5, near Glendale. Air traffic controllers noted poor visibility around Burbank, just to the north, and Van Nuys, to the northwest. After holding up the helicopter for other aircraft, they cleared the Sikorsky S-76 to proceed north along Interstate 5 through Burbank before turning west to follow U.S Route 101, the Ventura Highway.\n\nShortly after 9:40 a.m., the helicopter turned again, toward the southeast, and climbed to more than 2,000 feet. It then descended and crashed into the hillside at about 1,400 feet, according to data from Flightradar24. When it struck the ground, the helicopter was flying at about 184 mph and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet per minute, the data showed.",

Cummings, a powerful figure in U.S. politics, passed away on Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges. He was 68 years old.\n\nBorn on January 18, 1951, Cummings, a sharecropper's son, served as the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform, where he led multiple investigations into President Donald Trump's governmental dealings. His district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore and well-to-do suburbs, is a black-majority constituency.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led investigations into the president's family members serving in the White House in 2019. President Trump criticized the Democrat's district as a \"rodent-infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\" The comments came weeks after Trump drew bipartisan condemnation for his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to leave the U.S. \"right now,\" and return to their \"broken and crime-infested countries.\"\n\nCummings responded by stating that government officials must stop making \"hateful, incendiary comments\" that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\nCummings' political career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP.\n\nThroughout his career, Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.\n\nCummings was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid in 2008. He chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.\n\nCummings was born on January 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told Cummings he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer. Despite this, Cummings proved the counselor wrong, becoming not only a lawyer but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become House speaker pro tem, the first black delegate to hold the position. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.\n\nCummings noted the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats. \"After coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it's clear that the lines are drawn here,\" Cummings said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996.\n\nCummings chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight. He cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected.",
    " Title: Movement for Broad-Based Ownership Gains Momentum in U.S. Communities\n\nArticle:\n\nA movement to address wealth inequality in the United States by promoting broad-based ownership is gaining momentum at the community level. Coalitions of civic, advocacy, city, and state leaders are embracing policies and practices that create broad-owned assets, aiming to return wealth to communities.\n\nOne model for broad-based ownership is employee ownership, where employees hold shares in a retirement trust. Employee-owned businesses pay 5 to 12 percent more in wages, have more than double the retirement accounts, and are one-fourth as likely to lay off workers compared to traditionally owned companies. Over a ten-year period, ESOP companies showed 2.5 percent higher job growth than other firms.\n\nOne successful example of employee ownership is Recology, a waste collection and recycling company in San Francisco with $800 million in revenues, entirely owned by its 3,000 employees. Nationally, there are over 7,000 companies with ESOPs, covering more than 10 million employees and collectively holding assets of nearly $1 trillion.\n\nOther models of broad-based ownership include social enterprises, municipally owned enterprises, and B Corporations, which are profit-making firms with a professed aim of social benefit. The nation's largest banks can be key allies in promoting these job-creating models, as they are already committed to investing in low- and moderate-income communities under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act.\n\nThe coming wave of company sales from aging baby boomer entrepreneurs presents an opportunity to shift wealth from the few to the many. At least 7 million owners of privately held businesses will reach retirement age between now and 2030. A new initiative, 50 by 50, aims to have 50 million employee owners by 2050.\n\nCities like New York have already allocated funds to develop worker cooperatives, such as the nation's largest worker cooperative, Cooperative Home Health Care Associates, with revenues of $60 million and over 2,300 employees. Another tool for advancing broad-based ownership is the nation's nearly 1,000 Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs), chartered to aid disadvantaged communities.\n\nH.R. 2096, the Promotion and Expansion of Employee Ownership Act, would aid in spreading the development of ESOPs by providing further tax incentives for conversion and technical assistance for making the transition. Sixty-eight percent of Americans support employee ownership, and it offers greater protection against layoffs, keeps companies rooted locally over the long term, and works to spread wealth to many.\n\nBroad-based ownership models, proven to be stable and sustainable, provide an important new strategy for reversing income inequality. As more and more cities and states develop cooperative economic models, financing of broad-based ownership is no longer on the fringe of economic debate; it's just good business. Marjorie Kelly, a Senior Fellow and Executive Vice-President of the Democracy Collaborative, is a proponent of this movement.",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Challenges in Responding to Egypt's Political Crisis Following President Morsi's Ouster\n\nArticle:\n\nThe removal of Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi by the Egyptian military has released the United States from a delicate position it found itself in before Wednesday's events: caught between a democratically elected leader and the democratic forces seeking his removal. The US will face hard questions over how to respond to a military coup in a country that is a key Middle East partner and a major recipient of US military aid.\n\nThe days ahead are likely to remain agitated and tense in Egypt, and the US will almost certainly face criticism from Mr. Morsi's supporters, who will say the US acquiesced to the illegal removal of an elected leader who had just marked the first year of a four-year term.\n\nThe Egyptian military acted to deflect accusations that the manner in which it removed Morsi amounted to a coup. While the military suspended the Morsi-era constitution, the commander-in-chief of the Egyptian armed forces, Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, told Egyptians in a televised address Wednesday night that the chief justice of Egypt's constitutional court \u2013 and not a military leader \u2013 would fill the presidency until new presidential elections can be held. The new interim president is to be sworn in Thursday.\n\nThe military said it acted in the \"public service\" not just to end the country's chaotic political crisis but to implement a \"roadmap to democracy\" that would have the support of Egypt's political factions and foster the \"reconciliation\" that Morsi failed to promote, General Sissi said. Although he did not mention Morsi by name, Sissi said the president had \"responded with negativity\" up to the last minute to the military's demands for a resolution of the political crisis.\n\nThe Egyptian military also sought to assure the United States, in a phone call to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, that it has no interest in holding onto power. As Egypt's turmoil reached a crescendo in recent days, the US attempted to appear neutral among the dueling parties, with both the White House and the State Department emphasizing that \"we don't take sides\" and calling on all factions to \"engage with each other\" and find a nonviolent political solution to their differences.\n\nBut by Wednesday afternoon, with events in Cairo moving fast and Morsi's ouster looking likely, US officials began shifting their stance. At the State Department, spokeswoman Jen Psaki reminded reporters that democracy is about more than elections. And she spoke critically of Morsi over what she said was his failure to \"take steps\" to address Egyptians' concerns \u2013 even as she held her fire toward the military.\n\nMorsi's televised speech Tuesday, in which he defiantly refused to meet protesters' demands and vowed never to step down, was a particular disappointment to the US, Ms. Psaki said. \"He had the opportunity [in the speech] to lay out certain steps\" to address the crisis, she said, \"and he did not take the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nThousands of Egyptians celebrated publicly Wednesday night, but it was unclear what path Morsi's many supporters planned to take. Meanwhile, the US military was preparing for the worst in Egypt, dispatching part of a Marine crisis response team stationed in Spain to Sigonella, Italy, to shorten the team's distance from Egypt in case its intervention was needed. The United States also ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Cairo, news reports said.\n\nIn May, the US quietly approved the annual $1.3 billion in US military aid to Egypt, despite qualms over progress in the country's democratization process, and it seems unlikely to suspend that aid even after a coup. The Egyptian military has close ties to the Pentagon, and the emphasis Wednesday on civilian leaders and a \"roadmap\" to democracy appears likely to blunt any criticism in Washington.\n\nNow that Morsi is out, the US is likely to insist that it continues to take no sides and only supports \"the Egyptian people,\" some regional analysts say. \"They'll continue trying to maintain this idea of a neutral position because they want to avoid looking like they are intervening in Egypt's politics,\" says James Phillips, a Middle East expert at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.\n\nHowever, the US was already suffering from a perception among Egyptians opposed to Morsi and the increasingly repressive actions of his Muslim Brotherhood party that it had \"tilted\" in Morsi's favor, Mr. Phillips says. And he says it will take more forceful pronouncements from Washington in favor of a democratic transition \u2013 at least \u2013 to sway a public dubious of US support.\n\n\"After having given the impression that we were shoring up the Muslim Brotherhood,\" Phillips says, \"I would welcome even an even-handed statement that indicates we are distancing ourselves from the political forces that aren't really interested in building a democracy in Egypt.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration Announces Deportation Reprieve for Young Illegal Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has announced a policy change that will halt the deportation of young illegal immigrants who meet certain conditions and begin granting work permits to them. The policy, which could affect as many as 800,000 individuals, is aimed at those who were brought to the United States before they turned 16, are 30 or younger, have lived in the country for at least five years, have no criminal record, and have either attended or graduated from a U.S. high school or served in the military.\n\nThe policy change is similar to the DREAM Act, a legislative proposal that has been blocked by Congress. The administration's move is seen as an attempt to address the concerns of Latino voters, who have been ambivalent about President Obama's re-election due to his failure to deliver on his promises regarding immigration reform during his first term.\n\nHowever, the policy change has been met with criticism and confusion. Some argue that the administration is attempting to \"checkmate\" a nearly identical proposal by Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which also offers work permits to DREAMers but does not provide a pathway to citizenship. The left has been critical of the omission of a pathway to citizenship in the Rubio plan, but is supportive of the Obama administration's policy despite the lack of a pathway to citizenship as well.\n\nAdditionally, there is controversy surrounding the administration's previous statements regarding the deportation of DREAMers. In the past, the administration has claimed that it is not deporting DREAMers, instead focusing on criminal enforcement. However, this has been called into question as DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants continue to be deported.\n\nIt is unclear how the administration will implement the policy change and how many DREAMers will ultimately benefit from it. Some may be able to take advantage of the new initiative, but many may not due to the unpopularity of the DREAM Act among a wide portion of the electorate. The administration has not provided details on how it will prioritize cases or how it will handle those who do not meet all of the criteria.\n\nIn the words of former President Ronald Reagan, \"Trust, but verify.\" The administration's record on immigration reform has been a subject of controversy and criticism, and it remains to be seen how this latest policy change will be implemented and how it will impact the lives of DREAMers.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Weighs Paris Climate Agreement Options, Including Senate Ratification\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Donald Trump's advisers prepare to finalize a policy on the Paris climate agreement, a new option has emerged: declaring the agreement a treaty and sending it to the Senate for potential rejection. This option could serve as a middle ground in the escalating debate between those who advocate for adhering to President Barack Obama's global warming deal and the Paris agreement's detractors, who argue that Trump would break a key campaign promise by not withdrawing from the pact.\n\nThe treaty proposal was put forth by Christopher C. Horner and Marlo Lewis Jr., senior fellows at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Under their vision, Trump could reclassify the Paris accord as a treaty, send it to the Senate for ratification, and require a two-thirds vote for approval. Given the Republican majority in the Senate, opponents of the agreement suggest that senators would either shelve the deal or outright reject it, thereby derailing the agreement.\n\nA briefing paper circulated among Republican senators this week stated that the deal should have been sent to Capitol Hill by Obama, but he \"knew that Congress would never approve such a flawed deal, so he refused to seek the Senate's advice and consent.\"\n\nSupporters of the Paris accord have their own memo drafted by lawyers in the State Department. That memo argues that sending the agreement to the Senate would result in the president giving up important powers and leaving Trump and his successors open to congressional meddling.\n\nThe Paris agreement is the primary international vehicle for addressing climate change. Obama committed the U.S. to the deal in 2015 but never submitted it for ratification, stating that it was an extension of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which the Senate ratified in 1992.\n\nThe State Department memo asserts that there are few risks to remaining part of the Paris deal, stating that the \"legal obligations are relatively few and are generally process-oriented [and] discretionary in their application or repeat existing obligations already contained in the Framework Convention.\"\n\nAs a decision nears, the positions among Trump's top advisers have become clear. Energy Secretary Rick Perry appears to join the \"remainers,\" though he advocates for renegotiating the agreement. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka Trump, and the White House general counsel's office also lean toward remaining in the agreement, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is pushing for withdrawal, and he is joined by U.N. Ambassador Nikki R. Haley, analysts said. Top presidential strategist Stephen K. Bannon is also an advocate for withdrawal.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. has written a letter urging the administration to maintain the Paris agreement, and the National Mining Association said this week, after its leaders met with Pruitt, that it will push for withdrawal, according to Politico.\n\nThe next test for the Paris accord will be in the middle of May, when finance ministers of the Group of Seven major economies meet in Italy. The heads of state meet at the end of the month. The leaders are hoping for a communique reaffirming the Paris agreement, while opponents within the U.S. are hoping to prevent that, stating it would tie Trump's hands going forward.",
    " Title: Trump Supporter's Perspectives on Presidential Behavior and Approval Ratings\n\nArticle:\n\nGregory Kline, a 46-year-old lawyer from Severna Park, Maryland, and a Republican, expressed understanding for President Donald Trump's support base, despite not voting for him. Kline believes that part of Trump's appeal comes from the anger directed towards the left, particularly the media. He noted that when Muslim terrorist attacks occur, the media often seeks pundits who claim most Muslims are peaceful, but when white supremacist incidents arise, all conservatives are associated with such actions.\n\nKline acknowledged that people are aware of Trump's erratic behavior but choose to overlook it due to his perceived fight against perceived attacks. He stated, \"It's not that people are deaf and dumb and don't see it. It's that they don't care. I've heard rational people I really respect make the craziest apologies for this president because they are sick of getting beat on and they are happy he's fighting back.\"\n\nA recent Monmouth University poll indicates that 41% of Americans approve of Trump's job performance, with 61% of these approvers stating they cannot imagine Trump doing anything that would make them disapprove of him. Conversely, a similar percentage of the opposing side believes there is nothing Trump could do, other than resigning, to win their approval.\n\nSupport for Trump, however, is not absolute for many individuals. Michael Dye, a 52-year-old engineer and the treasurer for the Republican Party in Annapolis, Maryland, expressed disappointment in Trump's response to the neo-Nazi march through the University of Virginia, his alma mater. Dye, who voted for Trump reluctantly, stated, \"At best it is na\u00efve to think that the people showing up for the original protest were there simply because they were upset that this statue was being taken down.\"\n\nDye also expressed disapproval of the chant \"Jews will not replace us\" during the march, stating, \"You can argue that it was 10% of the crowd. But there are those types in there and I've got a problem with that and I wish he'd specified that.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Mobilize for Election Day as Campaigns Prepare for Voter Turnout Operations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days leading up to the U.S. presidential election, both the Republican and Democratic parties are gearing up for Election Day, with each side expressing concerns about voter fraud and voting rights.\n\nRobert Bauer, the chief counsel for President Barack Obama's campaign, stated, \"The larger issue is the scale of the effort that is required to have Election Day run smoothly.\" He added, \"Any number of things can go wrong, not by anybody's fault or intention, but we are fully prepared, and so, we believe, are election officials around the country.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, both candidates presented themselves as agents of change while painting the other as an obstacle in a tight race that may hinge on the success of the campaigns' elaborate turnout operations.\n\nAt a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, President Obama scoffed at Mitt Romney's bid to claim the mantle of change, deriding him as a political quick-change artist who is repackaging the failed policies of previous Republican administrations. Speaking to 23,000 people on a high school football field in Hollywood, Florida, Mr. Obama said, \"When you make this choice, part of what you're choosing is who do you trust.\"\n\nRacing against the sun and the clock, both campaigns expressed confidence about their chances on Tuesday, though polls showed Mr. Obama holding a slender lead in several of the battleground states he needs to win the Electoral College.\n\nWhile each covered familiar ground from New Hampshire to Ohio, Mitt Romney sought to open a new front with a rally in Pennsylvania. Tightening polls have given him hope that he can take the state from Mr. Obama, who won there by a double-digit margin in 2008. However, Mr. Obama's advisers dismissed the foray as a desperate move by a challenger running out of other paths to victory.\n\nAt a rally in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, Mr. Romney made a point of mentioning a high-profile supporter, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose lavish praise of Mr. Obama's leadership after Hurricane Sandy has raised Republican eyebrows. In Hollywood, Florida, Mr. Obama was endorsed by Pitbull, a Cuban-American hip-hop artist, while the Marshall Tucker Band warmed up the audience for Mr. Romney in Pennsylvania, and Stevie Wonder played \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\" for Mr. Obama at a rally in Cincinnati.\n\nHours earlier in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama spoke to 14,000 people beneath the gold dome of the State House in Concord on a bright, chilly day that recalled any number of days that he and other hopefuls had walked the streets in their quest for a victory in the nation's first presidential primaries. Nearby was a reminder of how the state almost dashed Mr. Obama's dreams in 2008. On a line of paving stones in front of the New Hampshire State Library are chiseled the names of winners in the state's primary, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose victory there halted, for a time, Mr. Obama's surge after he won the Iowa caucus.\n\nOn this Sunday, however, Mr. Obama had the fortifying presence of former President Bill Clinton, who noted approvingly in his introductory speech that Mr. Obama wanted to accomplish many of the same things that Mr. Clinton had during his two terms in office. \"The test should be: What did the president do? What are the results? And compared to what?\" Mr. Clinton said. \"Compared to what could have happened, Barack Obama has done a good job.\"\n\nSavoring the moment, his voice not yet raw from too many speeches, Mr. Clinton gleefully accused Mr. Romney of shifting his position on the bailout of the automakers so many times that he could find work as \"chief contortionist in Cirque du Soleil.\"\n\nMoments earlier, in Des Moines, Mr. Romney told his supporters that the clock had nearly run out on the president's time in office, and he promised to usher in a new era of economic hope for families who are struggling across the country. \"Instead of building bridges, he's made the divide wider,\" Mr. Romney said. \"Let me tell you why it is he's fallen so short of what he promised: it's because he cared more about a liberal agenda than he did about repairing the economy.\"\n\nMr. Romney led the crowd in a call and response: \"I mean, do you think Obamacare created jobs? Did his war on coal, oil, and gas create jobs? Did Dodd-Frank regulations help banks make more loans? Does raising taxes put people to work?\"\n\n\"No,\" the crowd cried out in response to each question.\n\nIowa was also the scene of skirmishing over voting, as Republicans on Sunday night accused Democratic operatives of encouraging older voters to illegally fill out absentee ballots for their family members. A letter to the state's top election official from the chief counsel of the Republican National Committee said that a news report of \"the alleged conduct of Democratic and Obama operatives, if true, is highly disconcerting.\"\n\nWith the election being waged most intensely in fewer than a dozen states, the candidates seemed to be shadowboxing each other, with one arriving in a state just hours after the other left. After Iowa, Mr. Romney held rallies in Ohio and Virginia. He planned events in Florida, Virginia, Ohio, and New Hampshire on Monday.",
    " Title: Ceasefire Between Israel and Hamas Holds, but Tensions Remain High on Gaza Border\n\nArticle:\n\nA fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which began two days ago, remains intact despite clashes on the Gaza-Israel border on Friday. The truce, which calls for an end to Gaza rocket fire on Israel and Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was initiated after eight days of cross-border fighting, the bloodiest between Israel and Hamas in four years.\n\nHundreds of Palestinians approached the border fence in several locations in southern Gaza, testing expectations that Israel would no longer enforce a 300-meter-wide no-go zone on the Palestinian side of the fence. In one incident, several dozen Palestinians, most of them young men, approached the fence, coming close to a group of Israeli soldiers standing on the other side.\n\nIn one incident captured by Associated Press video, some Palestinians briefly talked to the soldiers, while others appeared to be taunting them with chants of \"God is Great\" and \"Morsi, Morsi,\" in praise of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, whose mediation led to the truce. At one point, a soldier shouted in Hebrew, \"Go there, before I shoot you,\" and pointed away from the fence, toward Gaza. The soldier then dropped to one knee, assuming a firing position. Eventually, a burst of automatic fire was heard, but it was not clear whether any of the casualties were from this incident.\n\nGaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra said a 20-year-old man was killed and 19 people were wounded by Israeli fire near the border. Palestinian U.N. observer Riyad Mansour said Israeli forces fatally shot Anwar Abdulhadi Qudaih in the head and injured at least 19 other Palestinian civilians in a border area east of Khan Younis.\n\nDuring the incidents, Hamas security tried to defuse the situation and keep the crowds away from the fence. Moussa Abu Marzouk, a top Hamas official at the ongoing negotiations in Cairo, told The Associated Press that the violence would have no effect on the ceasefire.\n\nThe crowds were mainly made up of young men but also included farmers hoping to once again farm lands in the buffer zone. Speaking by phone from the buffer zone, 19-year-old Ali Abu Taimah said he and his father were checking three acres of family land that have been fallow for several years. \"When we go to our land, we are telling the occupation (Israel) that we are not afraid at all,\" he said.\n\nIsrael's military said roughly 300 Palestinians approached the security fence at different points, tried to damage it, and cross into Israel. Soldiers fired warning shots in the air, but after the Palestinians refused to move back, troops fired at their legs, the military said. A Palestinian infiltrated into Israel during the unrest, but was returned to Gaza, it said.\n\nThe truce allowed both Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step back from the brink of a full-fledged war. Over eight days, Israel's aircraft carried out some 1,500 strikes on Hamas-linked targets, while Gaza fighters fired roughly the same number of rockets at Israel. The fighting killed 166 Palestinians, including scores of civilians, and six Israelis. Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. envoy, said more than 1,230 Palestinians were injured, predominantly women and children.\n\nIn Cairo, Egypt is hosting separate talks with Israeli and Hamas envoys on the next phase of the ceasefire - a new border deal for blockaded Gaza. Hamas demands an end to border restrictions, while Israel insists Hamas halt weapons smuggling to Gaza.\n\nMansour also accused Israel of intensifying its use of \"excessive and lethal force\" against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in recent days and of arresting at least 230 Palestinian civilians since the Gaza fighting began, including several members of the Palestinian Legislative Council who were detained at dawn Friday.\n\nThe Palestinian U.N. observer called on the Security Council and the international community \"to remain vigilant in their demands for a complete cessation of hostilities and for compliance by Israel.\" A poll Friday showed about half of Israelis think their government should have continued its Gaza offensive. The same survey showed Netanyahu's Likud Party and electoral partner Israel Beiteinu losing some support, but his hard-line bloc was still favored to form the next government after Jan. 22 elections.",
    " Title: Debt Ceiling Fight Likely to Resume Following Budget Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent bipartisan budget agreement, passed by the House last week and expected to be approved by the Senate this week, has alleviated the threat of a costly government shutdown. However, the looming debt ceiling fight, with its attendant risks of a U.S. government default, appears imminent.\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) hinted at another debt ceiling standoff over the weekend, stating on Fox News Sunday, \"We don't want nothing out of this debt limit. We're going to decide what it is we can accomplish out of this debt limit fight.\"\n\nRyan's stance is consistent with his previous statements, as he has long advocated for the debt ceiling as a battleground for spending cuts. During the government shutdown, Ryan argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed and with fellow Republican House members that the debt ceiling was the appropriate venue for fiscal debates.\n\nThe White House, on the other hand, has maintained that there will be no negotiations over the debt ceiling. Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated this position on Monday, stating, \"We have not and will not change our position, nor do we expect Republicans to travel down that road again.\"\n\nGiven Ryan's credibility as a fiscal conservative and his ambitions for higher office, it is unlikely he will back down from this position. This places him on a collision course with the White House.\n\nThe potential for another debt ceiling standoff comes at a time when the 2014 primary season is set to begin, increasing pressure on many Republicans to vote against a clean debt ceiling bill. If the two-year budget agreement marks a brief respite from the partisan tensions in Washington, it may only signal a temporary reprieve.",
    " Title: Protests on Immigration and Policing Disrupt Second Night of Democratic Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second night of the Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit was disrupted twice by protesters, who aimed to draw attention to immigration and policing issues.\n\nThe first interruption occurred during New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's opening statement, with a few audience members chanting, \"Fire Pantaleo.\" The chant was a reference to Staten Island, New York, police officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner. Garner, who was African American, died after being placed in a chokehold by Pantaleo, who is white. Police had approached Garner, suspecting he was illegally selling cigarettes.\n\nThe protest seemed to be directed at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been criticized for not pushing for Pantaleo's dismissal, particularly after the Justice Department declined to bring criminal charges against Pantaleo on July 16. De Blasio does not legally have the power to fire Pantaleo, according to The New York Times. However, his handling of the issue has contributed to his low approval ratings from his constituents. Other city leaders say de Blasio, who often talks about race issues through the lens of having a biracial son and who touted halting \"stop and frisk\" during his own opening statement, needs to speak up.\n\nNew York City public advocate Jumaane Williams told The Times that the mayor needs to \"do something or do not mention Eric Garner's name ever again... You cannot be president, you cannot be the Democratic nominee if Daniel Pantaleo is still on the force.\"\n\nThe chants grew loudest not when de Blasio spoke but during Booker's time. The former Newark, New Jersey, mayor has pressed de Blasio on the issue, and his staff tweeted during the debate that they welcomed the interruption to draw attention to the controversy, writing, \"Good for you. That's how change is made.\"\n\nDe Blasio did later acknowledge the issue on Twitter, writing, \"While I believe that respecting the process is the best way to get justice for Eric Garner's family, I recognize and identify with the pain people across this country are feeling.\"\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro weighed in from the debate stage, saying Pantaleo should be immediately removed from the NYPD. \"Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD,\" Castro said. \"He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice.\"\n\nA separate group of protesters later briefly disrupted the debate to protest former Vice President Joe Biden and the Obama administration's record on immigration. A group who identified themselves as the Cosecha Movement began chanting \"3 million deportations\" and unfurled a banner that read \"Stop all deportations on day one.\"\n\nThe group says it wants a halt to all immigrant detention and deportations on the first day of a new Democratic president's term in office. It's also pushing for reunification of families separated by deportation under the Trump administration and the immediate legalization of all estimated 11 million people who live in the country illegally.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Cosecha Movement had held a protest outside the Detroit theater and blocked traffic at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, which is an international border crossing between the U.S. and Canada.",
    " Title: Millennial Candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Defeats 10-Term Incumbent Joe Crowley in Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former Bernie Sanders volunteer, has defeated 10-term Democrat Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortez won with 57.5% of the vote, while Crowley, who had not faced a primary challenger in 14 years, received the remaining 42.5%.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a political novice and self-proclaimed socialist Democrat, ran a progressive campaign, supporting universal healthcare, tuition-free college, and criminal justice reform. She led a grassroots movement, raising more small-dollar donations than any other New York City congressional candidate.\n\nCrowley, who was seen as a potential future Speaker of the House, conceded defeat on Tuesday night. In his concession speech, he paid tribute to Ocasio-Cortez with a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born to Run.\"\n\nThe political left has been energized during the Trump presidency, and this upset within the Democratic Party establishment is seen as a warning shot. The liberal base's anger, stoked by heart-rending accounts of children separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border, has led to new bursts of activism, confrontation, and an anti-establishment fervor that could endanger seemingly safe Democratic politicians.\n\nOcasio-Cortez will now face Republican candidate Anthony Pappas in the November mid-terms. If she wins, she will become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.

    " Title: House of Representatives Passes Continuing Resolution to Fund Government, Excluding Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days leading up to the expiration date for America's \"temporary budget,\" the House of Representatives has passed a continuing resolution that will fund all parts of the government at sequestration levels through Dec. 15. The resolution, however, does not include funding for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nThe Republicans' stance on the matter is clear. If the health care law is not ready for full implementation, the American people should not be paying for it. No Republican is calling for a government shutdown, as that does not defund Obamacare. Instead, they are demanding an Obamacare shutdown.\n\nThe House has found a way to fund the government without funding Obamacare, following thousands of calls from constituents nationwide and a tumultuous August town hall recess. The Senate, however, has yet to take action on the resolution.\n\nCritics of Obamacare argue that the law has been plagued with procedural failures and unintended consequences. To date, there have been more than 20 delays, exemptions, and revisions to Obamacare, including a delay of the employer mandate for businesses.\n\nPublic discontent for the law continues to grow. A recent FreedomWorks national poll found that an overwhelming 82 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor a continuing resolution that \"does not include funding for Obamacare.\" Only 17 percent of all voters think Obamacare will have a positive personal impact, a new low point since the law was passed in March 2010.\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and the Senate Democrats have been criticized for their staunch defense of the law. Obamacare disproportionately burdens the most vulnerable among us, with young Americans paying higher costs to subsidize the older and wealthier.\n\nThe House Republicans' move to defund Obamacare has garnered support from various organizations, including the Teamsters, Young Americans for Liberty, and the AFL-CIO. Even AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka admitted this year that \"we made some mistakes\" in writing Obamacare.\n\nThe debate over the continuing resolution and Obamacare funding is ongoing, with the Senate yet to take action on the House-passed resolution. The standoff between the two houses of Congress could potentially lead to a government shutdown if a resolution is not reached by the deadline.",
    " Title: GOP Health Care Bill: A Tight Margin for Success as Republicans Seek to Replace ObamaCare\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans are facing a tight margin for success as they seek to replace the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) with their own health care package. The passage of the Republican health care bill comes down to the numbers, with the GOP only able to lose 21 votes before the measure fails on a party-line vote.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans, has the power to incinerate the health care measure on the floor due to a bylaw that compels its members to vote as a bloc if 80% of its 40-plus members feel the same on a given issue. This is reminiscent of the Democratic Blue Dog coalition, which was key to approving ObamaCare in 2010.\n\nIn 2010, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., lacked the votes to pass the final version of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). She authorized the House Rules Committee to allow but two amendments before the decisive ObamaCare debate. One amendment was for a Republican health care plan, and the other was a proposal written by then-Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich. The \"Stupak Amendment\" ultimately courted the support of just enough conservative, pro-life Democrats, allowing the House to approve the first iteration of Obamacare 220-215.\n\nThe question now is how lawmakers will contour the GOP health care plan to their liking, and what amendments might the GOP brass permit. Some top GOP aides and even lawmakers spent the past few days trolling conservatives who weren't on board, privately bad-mouthing them.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., may not emulate Pelosi when it comes to whipping a vote, but he exuded confidence Tuesday, predicting, \"We will have 218 votes. I can guarantee you.\" Ryan only needs 216 to approve the American Health Care Act (ACHA).\n\nRyan and other ACHA supporters must court members of the Freedom Caucus for their votes. Some top GOP aides and even lawmakers spent the past few days trolling conservatives who weren't on board, privately bad-mouthing them. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., co-wrote the ObamaCare replacement bill alongside House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas.\n\nThe margin to pass this bill could be tight. As the King sings, \"It's now or never\" \u2013 if Republicans are to repeal and replace ObamaCare. \"Tomorrow will be too late.\"",
    " Title: Republican Candidates' Stances on Iran Nuclear Agreement and Oil Fields in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2016 presidential race, the Iran nuclear agreement and the potential seizure of oil fields in Iraq have become key points of debate among the Republican candidates. Donald J. Trump, a candidate with minimal foreign policy experience, recently advocated for seizing oil fields that fund extremist groups, drawing a sharp rebuke from retiring Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Ray Odierno.\n\nGen. Odierno, who led American troops during the worst days of the Iraq war, cautioned against the candidates' eagerness to advocate force, reminding them of the need for \"sustainable outcomes\" after American troops leave. A similar debate about short-term versus long-term results, and American strength or weakness, is playing out in the debate over the nuclear agreement with Iran, signed a month ago in Vienna.\n\nAll Republican candidates oppose the Iran nuclear agreement. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has pledged to \"tear up\" the accord on his first day in office, a statement that often draws applause, as it does for at least five other candidates. However, scrapping the accord would, of course, free the Iranians to do the same. Some candidates are more cautious, such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who stated he would not \"abrogate the agreement on Day 1.\"\n\nAlmost none of the candidates have outlined what they would replace the agreement with, or how they would prevent Iran, once the deal was abandoned, from resuming a nuclear program that, by the Obama administration's own public estimates, has brought it within two or three months of \"breakout,\" the production of one weapon's worth of highly enriched uranium.\n\nMarco Rubio, the Florida senator, has suggested reimposing the sanctions waived by President Obama and working with Congress to impose new crushing sanctions. However, even he has skirted the question of what good reimposing those sanctions would do if America's negotiating partners\u2014China, Russia, and three European powers\u2014refuse to go along.",
    " Title: Study Shows Decline of Local Newspapers Leads to Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by political scientists and communications scholars reveals a correlation between the decline of local newspapers and political polarization in the United States. The research, which examines split-ticket voting as a measure of polarization, suggests that the loss of local news contributes to voters' increased partisanship and may impact election outcomes.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Political Communication, found that voters were 1.9 percent more likely to vote for the same party for president and senator after a newspaper closed in their community, compared to voters in statistically similar areas where a newspaper did not close. This shift in voting patterns is significant, as it is often enough to decide close elections, such as the U.S. House races in Minnesota's 1st district, Utah's 4th district, and Illinois's 13th district in 2018.\n\nThe study's authors examined the most extreme examples of declining local news, including 110 newspaper closures between 2009 and 2012. These closures affected both small weeklies, such as the Clarke Courier of Virginia and the alt-weekly Boston Phoenix, as well as major metropolitan dailies like Denver's Rocky Mountain News.\n\nThe researchers considered two explanations for their findings: either people switched to national news once their local newspaper closed or they felt less informed about local politics. To test these options, they looked at \"ballot roll-off,\" when voters leave their ballots blank for lower-level offices. If roll-off increased, that would show that people did not feel like they had enough information to vote in state elections. However, the study did not find higher roll-off after newspapers closed.\n\nThe partisan voting the study found is likely due to switching to national news rather than feeling less informed about local politics. The authors argue that local newspapers provide a valuable service to democracy by keeping readers' focus on their communities. When they lose local newspapers, readers turn to their political partisanship to inform their political choices.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that supporting local news with dollars and attention could help counteract the partisan polarization that has taken over American politics. The authors call for Americans to prioritize local news and recognize its importance in maintaining an informed and engaged citizenry.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee Report Confirms Al Qaeda Involvement in Benghazi Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has released a report stating that individuals linked to Al Qaeda groups were involved in the 2012 Benghazi attack, contradicting recent claims that the terror network was not a factor. The report, released on Monday, comes nearly a year after then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's controversial statement, \"What difference, at this point, does it make?\" during congressional questioning about the nature of the attack.\n\nThe report does not implicate Al Qaeda's \"core\" leadership, but it does blame some of the most influential Al Qaeda branches, including Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The report states, \"Individuals affiliated with terrorist groups, including AQIM, Ansar al-Sharia, AQAP, and the Mohammad Jamal Network, participated in the September 11, 2012, attacks.\"\n\nThe Senate committee report emphasizes that the intelligence suggests the attack was not \"highly coordinated,\" but rather \"opportunistic\" \u2013 possibly put in place in \"short order\" after protests over an anti-Islam film elsewhere in the region. However, it remains unclear if any group or person exercised overall command and control of the attacks. The report also reiterates that there was no protest in Benghazi before the attack.\n\nThe report delves into the security failures leading up to the attack at the U.S. mission in Benghazi. The committee determined the attack was \"preventable\" and the administration failed to respond to \"ample\" warnings that security was deteriorating before Sept. 11, 2012. The report faults the State and Defense departments and criticizes the Obama administration for failing to \"bring the attackers to justice.\"\n\nThe report provides details about a possible failed ambush, where attackers attempted to lure the CIA into the hospital where Ambassador Chris Stevens' body was being held.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) stated, \"The committee worked on a bipartisan basis to investigate the various allegations that have come out since the terrorist attacks in Benghazi in September 2012 and to get to the truth about what happened leading up to, during, and after the attacks.\" She hopes the report puts \"conspiracy theories\" to rest.\n\nSen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the panel, also said the report provides \"needed and deserved answers.\" He added, \"In spite of the deteriorating security situation in Benghazi and ample strategic warnings, the United States Government simply did not do enough to prevent these attacks and ensure the safety of those serving in Benghazi.\"",

With 97% of precincts reporting, Buttigieg has 26.2% of state delegate equivalents, while Sanders has 26.1%, a difference of just 3 out of 1,097 votes.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) trails with 18.2%, former Vice President Joe Biden has 15.8%, and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has 12.2%. No other Democratic presidential candidates broke the double-digit level in state delegate equivalents in the caucuses, which were marred by technical problems.\n\nIn the popular vote, Sanders leads with 26.5% compared to Buttigieg's 25%, translating into a difference of about 2,500 votes. Warren is also in third place in the popular vote in Iowa, getting more than 18,000 votes.\n\nEarlier tallies of state delegate equivalents showed Buttigieg with a narrow lead over Sanders. The chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, Troy Price, said in a call with state party officials Wednesday night that full results should be released by Thursday morning, according to CNN. A person on the call also told the network that Price promised an independent review.\n\nThis report was contributed by Marty Johnson and was last updated at 7:48 a.m.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Biden Leading Trump in Potential 2020 Election Matchup, but Gap Narrows\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a recent CNN/SSRS poll, former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by 5 percentage points in a potential general election matchup, with Biden receiving 49% of the vote and Trump receiving 44%. In matchups between Trump and other leading Democratic contenders, including South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the gap is closer.\n\nCompared to polling conducted in October, the Democratic margin in all head-to-heads has narrowed by at least 5 points. The polling data suggests that Trump is gaining ground as the 2020 election approaches.\n\nThroughout Trump's presidency, his approval rating has remained relatively stable, typically hovering in the high 30s to low 40s. He has consistently trailed Biden by high single to low double digits in the polls. However, the latest poll shows a significant shift in Trump's favor, with his lead over Biden dropping from 12 points to 7 points, and Trump picking up at least 4 points against other leading Democrats since October.\n\nIn the 15 closest states of the 2016 election, where the presidential contest was decided by 8 or fewer points, Trump is in a stronger position. None of the Democrats led in CNN's December poll in these states. This follows other swing state polling suggesting that, similar to 2016, Trump could win the electoral college while losing the popular vote.\n\nThe shift in Trump's favor nationally coincides with an upward movement in his personal popularity. His net favorable rating (favorable - unfavorable) stood at -6 points among voters in CNN's latest poll. This is a significant improvement from the -12 points he had in the two prior CNN polls that asked the question.\n\nThe average poll also shows Trump at the high end in his popularity. According to the FiveThirtyEight aggregate, this week Trump hit his highest approval rating among voters (45%) since March 2017.\n\nTrump's upward trajectory may be, at least in part, due to the economy. While most people generally think the economy is good, a booming 76% said it was good in the CNN poll out this week. That was the highest percentage since 2001.\n\nThe impeachment of Trump does not seem to be making much of an impact on the polls. This could be because fewer voters say it's an extremely or very important issue to their vote than any other issue tested by CNN in November. Additionally, it could be because opposition to impeaching and removing Trump is higher than Trump's popularity ratings. This means that more talk of impeachment may actually move Trump's approval rating up.\n\nAnother factor helping Trump is that presidential elections are not referendums. He will have a named Democratic opponent. None of the leading Democrats had a positive net favorability rating among voters in CNN's December poll. The drop in the Democrats' popularity could be because they are involved in a competitive primary, which is hurting their intra-party favorability ratings. None of the Democrats are anywhere near as popular among their own party's voters as Trump is with his. This could change once the primary ends, though.\n\nIndeed, it's not like Trump is in a great position. The two most likely Democratic nominees, Biden and Sanders, are ahead of him by 7 points and 4 points, respectively, in the average poll. Most incumbent presidents have been leading their potential opposition at this point before the election.",
    " Title: Trump's Approval Rating Remains Stable Amidst Criticism Following Putin Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's approval rating has shown little change in the first polls following his controversial joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Economist/YouGov polls. Trump's approval rating rose to 45 percent in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, marking his highest level in that poll since taking office. The Economist/YouGov survey showed no significant deviation from Trump's numbers the previous week.\n\nThe polls, which included responses both before and after the July 16 news conference in Helsinki, suggest a more pronounced negative impact may not be immediately apparent. However, it is possible that a more significant negative effect could emerge in the next wave of polls.\n\nDemocrats have offered several explanations for Trump's resilience, including the strength of the economy, his base's tendency to disregard negative press coverage, and the emotional connection he maintains with his supporters due to his willingness to address cultural hot-button issues such as race and immigration.\n\nHowever, Democrats argue that Trump's base may not be large enough to ensure sustained electoral success, either in the 2018 midterm elections or in the 2020 presidential race. Robert Shrum, a Democratic strategist who has worked on several presidential campaigns, stated, \"If another president had these numbers, his political people would be very worried about it. He only cares about his base, and, if you look at polls in general, they are in deep trouble for the 2018 election.\"\n\nThe NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that while 29 percent of Americans strongly approve of Trump, 44 percent strongly disapprove. This imbalance suggests that Democrats can expect greater intensity among their base, a factor that could be crucial since Democratic-leaning voting blocs tend to turn out less reliably in midterm elections than in presidential contests.\n\nOn the other hand, the same poll showed that the Democrats' lead in the so-called generic ballot\u2014where voters nationwide are asked which party they would prefer to control Congress\u2014had shrunk to 6 percentage points. This represents a notable slippage from the 10-point advantage the party enjoyed just a month prior.\n\nThis shrinkage in the Democrats' lead calls into question the idea of a \"blue wave\" that might sweep Democrats into power in the House or Senate after November, even if few independent voices back the president's claim, made on Twitter last month, that there might be a \"Red Wave\" for Republicans instead.\n\nAmong Democrats, there is continued faith that things will go their way in November. Tad Devine, who served as a senior adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, stated, \"The intensity is there. Democratic voters are paying a lot more attention, they are a lot more interested in participating.\" He added that the party did not need to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to framing the election.\n\nMany Democrats also emphasize the significant swath of the voting public that appears alienated\u2014perhaps permanently\u2014from Trump. His polarizing approach, they say, makes him more enemies than friends. The effect could be to the detriment of his party.\n\nReferring to Trump's conduct during the news conference with Putin and in the days afterward, Democratic strategist Joe Trippi stated, \"The 55 or 56 percent who say they disapprove of him? I think this really locks that in...This last nine, 10 days or so makes it much tougher for a Republican candidate for Congress to pull them back.\"\n\nOpinions diverge as to why Trump himself commands such strong loyalty from his base of support. Shrum argued that economic factors were less relevant than other, gut-level responses. \"I just think there is a deep emotional investment in him by a shrinking Republican Party,\" Shrum said. \"He speaks to the politics of resentment, he speaks to the anxieties\u2014though I think his remedies are absurd\u2014of people who think they have been left behind, and so they don't want to give up on him.\"\n\nDevine argued that the strong economy played its part as \"protective armor\" for Trump\u2014but he asserted that an anti-media reflex is also part of the picture. \"Usually the battles are between the Democrats and the Republicans, but in Trump's case it is himself and the press,\" he said. \"That's the battle, and he is delivering these messages to people in his base, and they are responding to it.\"\n\nDevine also asserted that support for Trump was more complicated than the headline figures from a poll suggest. \"They don't really like the way Trump has handled himself, but they also think he is being attacked unfairly and all this other stuff,\" he said.\n\nFor the moment, however, the idea of a Trump collapse looks increasingly unrealistic, at least in the short term. That's giving his opponents, as well as his supporters, plenty of food for thought.",
    " Title: IRS Ex-Commissioner's Wife Tied to Liberal Campaign Finance Reform Group\n\nArticle:\n\nDouglas Shulman, the former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner who oversaw the agency during the period it targeted conservative groups, has come under renewed scrutiny due to his wife's association with a prominent left-leaning political organization. Susan L. Anderson, Shulman's wife, is a senior program adviser for the Washington-based group Public Campaign.\n\nPublic Campaign, which bills itself as nonpartisan, states it works with a broad range of organizations to reform campaign-finance rules. However, the group receives significant funding from liberal organizations such as the Ford Foundation, Barbra Streisand's The Streisand Foundation, and Health Care for America NOW, a coalition of labor unions supporting ObamaCare that includes the AFL-CIO and the Service Employees International Union, according to the Public Campaign website.\n\nIn 2011, Public Campaign produced a video that appeared to suggest that the wealthiest Americans, specifically the top 1 percent, were trying to buy or influence elections by secretly donating to political groups. The video's message was critical of conservative figures like the Koch brothers, who have nonprofit groups supporting Tea Party-tied heavyweights like FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity.\n\nWhen the IRS scandal over the targeting of conservative groups broke, Public Campaign appeared to defend the tax agency. Nick Nyhart, the group's chief executive, suggested to ABC News that the misdeeds of a \"few bad apples\" within the agency would \"make it harder for those questions to be asked without claims of bias.\"\n\nAnderson, who has also been a supporter and apparent participant in the Occupy Wall Street movement, met Shulman as students at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Shulman was appointed commissioner by former President George W. Bush and reportedly logged more than 100 visits to the White House under Obama, a claim he did not deny during congressional testimony last month on the IRS scandal. That number refers to the number of times Shulman was cleared to visit.",
    " Title: U.S. to Issue Guidance on Reducing Unnecessary COVID-19 Testing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is set to release guidance aimed at reducing unnecessary COVID-19 testing, as part of efforts to decrease turnaround times for tests. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, made the announcement on Thursday.\n\nThe specifics of the guidance are still under development, but it will reportedly discourage individuals who have completed home quarantine from getting retested before returning to work or school. Giroir stated that such unnecessary tests are contributing to system congestion.\n\nGiroir explained that individuals who are critically ill or have immune system issues may require retesting due to the possibility of prolonged virus shedding. However, for most individuals, a seven to eight-day isolation period should suffice.\n\nTurnaround times for COVID-19 tests remain an issue, with Giroir expressing a desire to see the average time decrease to three days. Currently, only 26 states are managing to produce test results within this timeframe, with one state taking more than five days.\n\nGiroir emphasized that the new testing guidance is not a response to shortages, but rather a measure to address the unnecessary use of tests. The U.S. government is working towards a transition from lab-based tests, which can take longer to process, to point-of-care tests. These tests can provide results in minutes and can be conducted in a wider variety of locations.\n\nThe U.S. government anticipates having 20 million point-of-care tests per month available by September. Becton Dickinson announced on Wednesday that the U.S. government has agreed to purchase 750,000 of its point-of-care tests.",

However, Hill, in an interview with the New York Times, stated that she was not satisfied with the conversation and declined to characterize his comments as an apology.\n\nBiden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and oversaw the confirmation hearing during which Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment, contacted Hill earlier this month to express his \"regret for what she endured\" during the hearing. But Hill told the newspaper that she could not support Biden until he takes responsibility for his behavior.\n\nHill, now a law professor, told the New York Times that she was not satisfied with Biden's outreach and declined to characterize his comments as an apology. \"I can not be satisfied by simply saying I'm sorry for what happened to you,\" she said. \"I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.\"\n\nBiden has previously apologized for allowing an all-male and all-white panel of lawmakers to aggressively question Hill during the hearing. His role in the hearing has come under fresh scrutiny in light of the #MeToo movement and the 2018 Supreme Court hearing of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who denied accusations of sexually assaulting a woman when he was a teenager.\n\nHill told the newspaper that she could not support Biden until he takes responsibility for his behavior. \"The focus on apology to me is one thing,\" she said. \"But he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw. And not just women. There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Biden's 2020 campaign confirmed his outreach to Hill. \"They had a private discussion where he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBiden publicly addressed his treatment of Hill last month at an event in New York City honoring students who helped fight sexual violence on college campuses. \"She faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell this was all about,\" he said at the event. \"To this day, I regret I couldn't give her the kind of hearing she deserved.\"\n\nHill's comments come as Biden defends himself against allegations from several women who have accused him of unwanted, inappropriate behavior. \"Social norms are changing,\" Biden said in a video. \"I understand that, and I've heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful of personal space in the future. That's my responsibility, and I will meet it.\"",
    " Title: Facebook Study Shows Partisan Tendencies in News Feed, Raising Concerns for Future Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook, with over 1.3 billion users, functions as the world's most widely read daily newspaper, according to Pew Research Center. Approximately 30 percent of American adults obtain their news from Facebook. The editorial decisions on the platform, however, are made with limited transparency through the News Feed algorithm.\n\nIn a recent study published in Science, Facebook researchers have found that the News Feed algorithm does not significantly contribute to the polarization of national discourse, potentially providing a defense for the social network against criticisms. The study's results were reviewed before publication, with an anonymous panel of scholars unaffiliated with Facebook overseeing the process.\n\nIt is important to note that this study differs from a previous controversy involving Facebook, where the company's scientists manipulated the number of positive and negative posts that some users saw to examine the effects on mood. In contrast, this study did not involve any experiment that altered users' experience of Facebook; instead, researchers analyzed how people use Facebook as it stands today.\n\nFor the study, researchers first identified the political leanings of news articles by examining which political group shared them most frequently. They found predictable partisan attitudes toward certain news sources, with Fox News stories being shared primarily by conservatives and Huffington Post articles being shared by liberals.\n\nNext, they measured how often the feeds of users, whose identifying details had been removed, displayed stories that contradicted their professed ideologies, and how often they clicked on those stories.\n\nSome academics have expressed concerns that Facebook could easily manipulate the News Feed to create a more isolated echo chamber. David Lazer, a political scientist at Northeastern University who studies social networks, wrote in a commentary on the Facebook study also published in Science, \"A small effect today might become a large effect tomorrow. The deliberative sky is not yet falling, but the skies are not completely clear either.\"",
    " Title: House Representative Matt Gaetz Introduces Resolution Calling for Robert Mueller's Recusal from Special Counsel Role\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) has introduced a resolution calling for the resignation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller from his role in the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Gaetz, along with Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas and Andy Biggs of Arizona, cite Mueller's involvement in the \"Uranium One\" controversy, during which he served as FBI Director.\n\nThe Uranium One scandal refers to a deal approved by the Obama administration that allowed a Russian company to purchase a controlling interest in Uranium One, a Canadian mining company. The deal is frequently used by Republicans to shift the focus away from Mueller's investigation towards the story President Trump has called \"one of the biggest stories in a decade.\"\n\nIndividuals like Gaetz and Gohmert argue that Hillary Clinton, who was serving as Secretary of State, approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for $145 million in donations from company investors to the Clinton Foundation. However, Clinton did not have the ability to approve or veto the sale, and her involvement was as one of nine cabinet members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Only the president can decide to block a sale for national security reasons. None of the other eight members or President Obama voted against or blocked the sale, and this is likely because the sale posed no national security risk.\n\nA lot of discussion surrounding the scandal focuses on an argument that Russia obtained 20 percent of the American uranium supply\u2014in reality, it's closer to zero. This is because the U.S. mines owned by Uranium One do not contain quality uranium and are barely used. The Russians were only interested in Uranium One to create productive Uranium mines in Kazakhstan.\n\nWhile a recent report found that roughly 20 Republican Senators have expressed support for Mueller and his investigation, there is still a faction on the right that believes Mueller should resign. A headline on FoxNews.com from Monday, when former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his close associate Rick Gates were asked to turn themselves in to the FBI, read \"Mueller facing new Republican pressure to resign in Russia probe.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Gaetz told the Washington Post they expect to pick up more support from the House Freedom Caucus, many members of which signed on to another bill by Gaetz that called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel to look into former FBI Director James Comey's actions.\n\nWhile the White House has stated Trump has \"no intention\" on firing Mueller, Trump himself has certainly left the possibility open. His personal lawyer Jay Sekulow went on ABC News this week and said, \"You could only terminate a special counsel for cause, and we just don't see any basis for cause.\" Sekulow admits that there is no cause for Trump firing Mueller at the moment, but Trump himself has hinted at one issue he has with the Muller investigation that could give him cause.\n\nDuring a New York Times interview in July, Trump responded to a question by reporter Michael Schmidt asking if Mueller's focus on the Trump family finances would be taking the investigation too far. \"I would say yeah,\" Trump responded.\n\nWhat this resolution shows is if Trump were to fire Mueller, he would have the support of some members in Congress.",

These groups, clubs, and associations played a unique role in American society, as they filled needs and worked for change more efficiently than any government program ever could.\n\nExamples of such organizations include Kiwanis, supper clubs, Shriners, churches, bowling leagues, the PTA, the Elks, ladies' associations, and countless others. These groups raised thousands of dollars for local charities and volunteered countless hours.\n\nHowever, since the height of social clubs and civic organizations in the 1960s, membership has more than halved. The Elks, for instance, boasted 1.6 million members in 1976, but by 2012, there were around 800,000 Elks nationwide. Similarly, the PTA's membership plummeted from 12 million in 1964 to fewer than 4 million by 2016.\n\nPolitical scientist Robert Putnam first raised the alarm about this trend in his 2000 book \"Bowling Alone.\" Putnam's research on Americans' socializing habits revealed a concerning trend of isolation, with a significant drop in participation in club meetings, family dinners, and social gatherings.\n\nThe decline in community organizations has led to a fracturing of communities, which has contributed to increasing political polarization. In the past, neighbors with competing political views could come together in community organizations, such as the Elks Lodge, the PTA, or church.\n\nToday, most Americans have few or even no friends with worldviews that differ from their own. Distrust and even loathing of people with opposing political views is rapidly growing, and people are reading and watching their own side's news almost exclusively.\n\nSharing freedom and changing hearts and minds, which depend on forming real relationships with people who disagree with us, is almost impossible in a climate like this. As 2018 approaches, let's make a recommitment to our communities, find that social club, civic organization, or bridge game, and make an effort to step outside our comfort zone and build relationships with the people who live down the street. After all, being together is so much better than bowling alone, and it just might help you build a stronger community and save the country.\n\nSlade O' Brien, the vice president of Grassroots Leadership Academy, an organization dedicated to equipping people to fight for freedom in their communities, emphasizes the importance of community engagement.

    " Title: Republican Leadership Vows to Avoid Gridlock and Infighting After Midterm Elections\n\n Article:\n\n In the aftermath of their recent midterm election victories, the Republican congressional leadership has signaled a shift towards avoiding gridlock and infighting. According to Politico, incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he will not support conservative calls to use the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for spending cuts, a move that triggered the government shutdown last year.\n\n Politico reported that Republican leaders are determined to avoid repeating the fiscal fights of the past, which eroded public confidence in Washington and became synonymous with the GOP-controlled House. McConnell has already pledged that there will be no government shutdown during his tenure, and in his victory speech, he extended an olive branch to President Barack Obama, stating that the GOP has a \"duty\" to work with the White House on issues they agree on.\n\n House Speaker John Boehner is also reportedly planning to act as a \"responsible leader,\" and the party needs to be unified to capitalize on its political dominance, according to Politico. The leadership may feel more justified in demanding loyalty from the conservative wing of the party, given that the election victories were largely due to the party's early backing of establishment candidates, some of whom represent moderate districts.\n\n Ohio GOP Rep. Steve Stivers, a close ally of Boehner, told Politico, \"What this election did is give us a working majority where we have at least 218 votes to pass a Republican agenda, and what I think will be a responsible Republican agenda.\" He added, \"We're not veering hard right, we're playing it straight down the fairway, to use a Boehner-ism.\"\n\n McConnell and Boehner have already outlined their legislative agenda, stating in a joint editorial that their top priority is to help the struggling middle class. They plan to pass many of the bills the House has already approved as a first step, which they believe will signal that the Washington logjam has been broken and establish a foundation of certainty and stability.\n\n The leadership will also be aware that unity could be crucial to maintaining the Senate majority in 2016, when a number of senators from blue and purple states are up for re-election, according to Politico.",
    " Title: Republican Party Shifts Stance on Marijuana Laws Ahead of 2016 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential hopefuls are advocating for a softening of federal marijuana laws, marking a significant shift from the party's previous stance. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Texas Gov. Rick Perry have been the most vocal in this regard, advocating for states' rights in marijuana-related issues.\n\nSen. Paul argues that the federal government should not interfere with marijuana laws, while Gov. Perry supports state-level decriminalization, citing drug courts in Texas that he believes have contributed to the state's movement towards decriminalization.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has expressed a desire to end the \"failed war on drugs,\" a policy initiated by President Nixon, a Republican, in 1971. Erik Altieri, a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, noted that this shift in Republican stance is particularly noticeable in the past few months.\n\nIn contrast, during the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney vowed to fight marijuana legalization, even for medical use, and the 2008 nominee, Sen. John McCain, labeled marijuana as a \"gateway drug.\" However, Mr. McCain recently signaled a change in attitude by suggesting that marijuana should be legalized.\n\nThe shift in marijuana policy is not limited to the Republican Party. In a recent interview, President Obama, who has acknowledged using marijuana in his youth, stated that marijuana may be less dangerous than alcohol.\n\nPublic opinion is also shifting, with voters in Colorado and Washington approving referendums allowing recreational use of marijuana for adults over 21. More than 12 states have decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana, and 20 states, including California since 1996, have enacted legislation allowing medical marijuana.\n\nUnder federal law, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance, making it illegal to manufacture or distribute the drug. However, the Obama administration has stated it will allow states leeway as long as they do not see evidence of criminal gangs trafficking the drug or children gaining access.\n\nThe issue of marijuana legalization is significant in states crucial to the 2016 elections, such as New Hampshire, which hosts the first-in-the-nation presidential primaries. In New Hampshire, Republicans in the state legislature have helped pass a bill legalizing marijuana for recreational use.\n\nRep. Steve Vaillancourt, the Republican sponsor of the bill, expressed hope that Republicans will not oppose marijuana legalization as they did with same-sex marriage. He believes that, in a few years, Republicans will overwhelmingly support marijuana legalization.\n\nSen. Paul has stated that smoking marijuana is not a good idea and could lower a person's IQ. However, he believes states should be able to legalize marijuana if they wish, and it does not make sense to imprison nonviolent marijuana users.\n\nGov. Perry opposes legalization but supports policies that can lead to decriminalization, such as drug courts. Gov. Christie, in his inaugural address, criticized the \"war on drugs\" as based on the misguided notion that incarceration is the solution to every ill caused by drug abuse.",
    " Title: South and North Korean Leaders Meet to Discuss US-North Korea Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nThe leaders of South Korea and North Korea have met in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries. The meeting, which is the second between South Korea's Moon Jae-in and North Korea's Kim Jong-un, comes as the two sides continue efforts to put a historic US-North Korea summit back on track.\n\nThe latest talks were held on the northern side of the Panmunjom truce village between 15:00 and 17:00 local time (06:00 and 08:00 GMT), according to Mr. Moon's office. Both leaders exchanged opinions for the successful holding of the North Korea-US summit, with Mr. Moon announcing the outcome of the talks on Sunday morning.\n\nIn Washington, Trump administration spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed that an advance team of White House and Department of State officials would leave for Singapore this weekend, as originally scheduled, to prepare for a possible summit there. The talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, if they were to go ahead, would be focused on ways of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions.\n\nAfter cancelling the scheduled summit last Thursday, blaming North Korea's \"tremendous anger and open hostility,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday that \"very productive talks\" had taken place with the North on reinstating the summit with Mr. Kim.\n\nWhile the goal of both sides is said to be denuclearization, what this actually means to Pyongyang and Washington appears to differ. US officials have said they would like to see the complete and irreversible dismantling of the North's nuclear program and weapons, allowing international inspectors to check every step of that process, before any talk of sanctions being lifted. For North Korea, denuclearization means a much more reciprocal agreement. If Pyongyang were to give up its nuclear assets, it would like to see a comparable gesture from Washington.\n\nThe US has a large military presence in South Korea and in Japan - both of which North Korea would expect to be scaled down. It also wants assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question. Doubt was cast over the scheduled summit when North became angered by comments from senior US officials, who made comparisons with Libya. There, former leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nascent nuclear program only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later.\n\nIn April, the leaders of both Koreas held a historic meeting at the border, promising to end hostilities and work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The rare dialogue - the first time the Korean leaders met to hold talks since 2007 - came after months of improving relations between the two countries. At the carefully choreographed meeting, Mr. Kim said that he wanted to \"write a new chapter\" for the region's troubled history. \"New history starts from now, at the historic starting point of an era of peace,\" he said.\n\nFuture economic cooperation between the Koreas was also discussed, and Mr. Kim admitted to Mr. Moon that the North's critical infrastructure was in need of improvement. Such projects are likely to have suffered under international and US sanctions, imposed on the North as a reaction against its nuclear program and missile tests.",
    " Title: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's Testimony Against Sessions and the Debate on Civility in Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Senator Cory Booker testified against Senator Jeff Sessions' nomination to be attorney general in 2017, an event that has sparked a renewed discussion on civility in politics. In a recent article, conservative commentator David French criticizes Booker's behavior during the hearing, citing instances where he interrupted California Senator Kamala Harris in two separate hearings and displaying what French describes as \"temper tantrum\" behavior.\n\nFrench, a senior writer for a certain publication and senior fellow at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Institute, argues that if a conservative male senator had behaved similarly towards a progressive female cabinet secretary, there would be widespread outrage from the liberal side. He introduces the term \"manterrupting\" to describe this behavior, which he claims is not uncommon when a female pundit, politician, or activist leans slightly to the right of moderate.\n\nFrench criticizes the hypocrisy he perceives in the Democratic Party, citing their condemnation of President Trump's comments and actions towards women, while seemingly tolerating similar behavior from their own members. He also references the Iran-Iraq War phase of conflicts over civility, suggesting that the only remaining norm is hypocrisy.\n\nFrench concludes by advocating for a return to respectful discourse, even in times of anger, quoting a retired federal judge who advised speaking with regret, not outrage, to counteract a culture of outrage. French criticizes Booker's behavior during the Sessions hearing and suggests that the Democratic Party should offer the country something other than Trumpism dressed in blue if they aim to argue they can do better.",
    " Title: U.S. President Trump Imposes Tariffs on Remaining Chinese Imports, Escalating Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the imposition of tariffs on all remaining imports from China, marking an escalation in the ongoing trade war between the two nations. The new tariffs, which are expected to affect approximately $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, will be in addition to the existing 25% tariff rate on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, as announced by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in a statement.\n\nLighthizer stated that a final decision on the new duties has not been made, but the increased tariffs would come into effect following the current 10% rate. The talks between the U.S. and Chinese negotiators have not resulted in significant progress, as China proposed extensive revisions to a draft trade agreement last week.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump defended the tariff hike and stated that he is in \"absolutely no rush\" to finalize a deal, adding that the U.S. economy would gain more from the levies than any agreement. Despite the escalation in tariffs, both Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He have agreed to continue negotiations, avoiding a complete breakdown in talks between the world's two largest economies.\n\nChina responded to the U.S. tariff hike with countermeasures, but did not elaborate on the nature of these countermeasures. In response to the increased tariffs, U.S. stock indexes reversed course to close higher, and yields on U.S. government debt also drifted higher after the end of the talks.\n\nThe new 25% U.S. duty is being imposed on more than 5,700 categories of products, including internet modems, routers, circuit boards, furniture, and lighting products. Seaborne cargoes shipped from China before midnight were not subject to the new tax as long as they arrive in the United States prior to June 1. Those cargoes will be charged the original 10% rate.\n\nEconomists and industry consultants predict that it may take three or four months for American shoppers to feel the impact of the increased tariffs. The higher tariffs could reduce U.S. gross domestic product by 0.3% and China's by 0.8% in 2020, according to consultancy Oxford Economics.\n\nWhile Trump has maintained that his trade policies will boost U.S. manufacturing, some in the sector are concerned that the policies could backfire if the dispute with China is not resolved soon. Michael Haberman, president of Gradall Industries Inc in New Philadelphia, Ohio, which sells about 5% of its machinery to China, expressed concern, stating, \"For us, the longer this continues, the more dangerous it becomes.\"\n\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stated that Trump had asked him to create a plan to support American farmers, as the U.S. government has already rolled out up to $12 billion to help offset their China-related losses.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Vice Presidential Pick: Michael Bloomberg as a Potential Compassionate, Fiscal Conservative\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is reportedly considering a vice presidential running mate with a strong conservative background and a track record of success, particularly in a swing state. This potential choice, according to political analyst LZ Granderson, could be former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg, known for his union-fighting and gay-friendly policies, has been elected three times in a diverse region while being a wealthy, older white man. His election history, combined with his moderate social views, could attract voters on the fence, a demographic that Romney is targeting.\n\nIn 2008, Sen. John McCain selected Sarah Palin, a game-changer who, while popular, was criticized for her lack of experience. Bloomberg, like Palin, would be a curveball, but unlike Palin, he would engage voters in thoughtful discussions rather than just generating buzz.\n\nBloomberg is perceived as a compassionate leader with traditional Republican views, focusing on deficit reduction through increased revenue and tough spending cuts. He is also known for his pragmatic approach to politics, a quality that could appeal to independent voters.\n\nOne of Bloomberg's notable statements is his opposition to the idea of promising a \"free lunch,\" a reference to the common criticism that Republicans often promise tax cuts without addressing the resulting deficits. This stance, Granderson notes, resonates with voters who are looking for honest assessments and solutions, rather than partisan cheerleading.\n\nIn the past, Bloomberg has expressed support for Romney's presidential bid but has not endorsed him due to differences in social policy. However, Granderson suggests that Romney's social conservatism has not been well-received by the religious right, and choosing a safe, religious conservative running mate may not improve his standing with this group.\n\nGranderson argues that Romney needs a vice president who can address economic issues effectively, as opposed to focusing on social policy. He suggests that the country cannot afford another platform bait-and-switch, referring to the 2010 government shutdown over the Republican obsession with Planned Parenthood during budget talks.\n\nIn conclusion, Granderson posits that a vice presidential pick like Bloomberg, who is a real, old-school Republican, could help Romney appeal to independent voters and address economic issues effectively, potentially leading to a more successful presidential campaign. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.",
    " Title: Migrant Mother Selected for U.S. Asylum Processing in Tijuana\n\nArticle:\n\nGabriela Hernandez, a 27-year-old pregnant mother of two, was chosen by her fellow migrants to begin the process of seeking asylum in the United States on Monday. Hernandez, who had fled a threat of violence in Honduras with her sons, ages 6 and 2, was among eight people selected to present themselves to U.S. border officials.\n\nHernandez and her sons were part of a group of migrants who had traveled hundreds of miles to reach the U.S. border crossing at Tijuana, Mexico. However, they were initially turned away due to capacity constraints at the port of entry.\n\nDozens of migrants vowed to camp outside the center, waiting for \"every last one\" to be admitted into the United States. When U.S. customs officials resumed processing cases of \"undocumented arrivals\" on Monday, the migrants chose Hernandez and another woman, Tesla Rich, to step forward.\n\nHernandez and Rich, along with their children and another mother and child, and a teenager traveling alone, were processed by border protection officers. The outcome of their asylum claims is unknown.\n\nHernandez's plan had always been to claim asylum, given the danger to her life and her children in Honduras. \"I don't know what I'm going to do,\" she had said earlier. \"I can't go back to my country.\"",
    " Title: State Attorneys General Launch Antitrust Investigations of Google and Facebook, Adding Pressure on Federal Regulators\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of attorneys general from 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico announced on Monday that they would pool resources to probe Google's advertising business. This announcement follows that of a smaller, overlapping group of attorneys general led by New York's Letitia James, who is investigating Facebook's business practices.\n\nThe group investigating Google, which includes all states except California and Alabama, stressed their independence from federal regulators, who are already asking their own questions of the company. Google previously disclosed that it is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nD.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, said, \"The state attorneys general, they are an independent bunch. And they can be quite tenacious. So I'm very confident that this bipartisan group is going to be led by the facts and not be swayed by any conclusion that may fall short, if you will, if it's inconsistent with our facts, on the federal side.\"\n\nThe state attorneys general's actions could indicate a level of dissatisfaction among top state legal officials when it comes to federal action against Big Tech. Recently, federal regulatory action against Facebook and Google has had little impact on their core businesses or stock prices.\n\nIn the past, states have played a noteworthy role in antitrust cases, gaining significant concessions from tobacco companies and pressing Microsoft in a landmark antitrust case. In that case, attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia joined the Justice Department in alleging Microsoft suppressed competition in the software market. However, the Justice Department decided to settle with the company, and several states vocally dissented against what they saw as a weak agreement.\n\nHalf a dozen antitrust experts interviewed for this article said state investigations can certainly add heat to the federal probes, but ultimately, their resources pale in comparison to those of the FTC and the Department of Justice (DOJ). \"The big picture here is that states can serve as a backstop if the federal government decides not to go after these companies,\" Rutgers Law professor Michael Carrier said. \"You're putting 30 generally small offices together and then they have to coordinate,\" said Harry First, a professor at the New York University School of Law. \"It's good, but it's not quite the same as the extent of the staffs on the federal level.\"\n\nConsidering both Google and Facebook are large global companies, \"it's a heavy lift,\" First said. The state attorneys general's investigations may, however, serve as a welcome development for those waiting to see if the U.S. government will deal a more significant blow to Big Tech.",
    " Title: Facebook to Adjust Salaries for Remote Workers Based on Location, Zuckerberg Says\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer, Mark Zuckerberg, has outlined the company's future remote-working plans during a videoconference with employees on Thursday. Zuckerberg expects about half of Facebook's employees to work from home five to ten years from now, with a caveat for those planning to live in low-cost areas while maintaining high salaries.\n\nZuckerberg stated that Facebook will \"aggressively\" ramp up the hiring of remote workers, though not all employees would be allowed to permanently work from home at the start. For those who choose to work in areas with lower costs of living, salaries will be adjusted accordingly.\n\n\"That means if you live in a location where the cost of living is dramatically lower, or the cost of labor is lower, then salaries do tend to be somewhat lower in those places,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nFacebook already pays based on location, but employees working remotely must notify Facebook if they move to a new area before January 1, 2021. \"We'll adjust salary to your location at that point,\" he said, noting that taxes will need to be taken into account. \"There'll be severe ramifications for people who are not honest about this.\"\n\nThis may impact the plans of some workers hoping to stretch their salaries further in cheaper areas. A recent survey of San Francisco Bay Area tech workers found that two-thirds would consider moving away from the pricey area if they could work remotely.\n\nAs of 2018, the median employee compensation at Facebook was over $240,000 a year. The median home price in Menlo Park, California, where Facebook has its headquarters, is $2.4 million, according to Zillow, while the median home price in the wider Bay Area was $928,000 last year.\n\nZuckerberg shared that, in a company survey, of the people who said they would want to work remotely full-time, about 45% were \"pretty confident\" that they would move to another place if they had that opportunity, with an additional 30% saying they \"might\" move. About 60% of that total said they'd prefer to move to a smaller city or town.\n\nUltimately, Zuckerberg said the changes will help Facebook become more diverse in its workforce. \"When you limit hiring to people who either live in a small number of big cities or are willing to move there, that cuts out a lot of people who live in different communities, different backgrounds or may have different perspectives,\" he said. \"Certainly being able to recruit more broadly, especially across the U.S. and Canada to start, is going to open up a lot of new talent that previously wouldn't have considered moving to a big city.\"\n\nCurrently, about 95% of Facebook's employees are working from home due to coronavirus stay-at-home orders. The company has previously said workers will be able to work from home at least through the end of the year.",
    " Title: A Neutral Perspective on the 2016 U.S. Election, Data Leaks, and the Alleged Russian Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, President Obama announced sanctions against Russia in response to alleged data theft and disclosure activities that were intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. Hillary Clinton, in her unsuccessful presidential campaign, described these activities as an \"attack against our country\" and \"our electoral system\" that undermined \"the integrity of our democracy.\"\n\nHowever, these overheated descriptions may misleadingly equate information that guides voters' choices with nullification of those choices. A calmer, less partisan perspective suggests that what Clinton and Obama view as interference with the election process might more accurately be described as voter education, which strengthens democracy by helping its participants make better-informed choices.\n\nNews reports often describe the leaking of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, as \"election hacking.\" John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, seems to agree with that characterization. In a CNN interview last month, the Arizona senator, a harsh critic of Donald Trump who denounced him, endorsed him, and then withdrew his endorsement, complained that by leaking information helpful to the Republican nominee, \"the Russians\u2026have been able to interfere with our electoral process.\" He warned that \"if they are able to harm the electoral process, then they destroy democracy, which is based on free and fair elections.\"\n\nHowever, that take seems pretty hysterical in light of what actually happened. True election hacking, aimed at perpetrating voting fraud, obviously would be a threat to the democratic process. But there is no evidence of such interference, and it's not even clear that the DNC and Podesta emails had an impact on the election results\u2014or why it would be so terrible if they did.\n\nThe New York Times reports that hackers gained access to the emails through standard phishing techniques, tricking Podesta and at least one DNC employee into revealing their passwords by pretending to be from Google. The Times notes that \"every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.\"\n\nThose news organizations did that because much of the information in the emails\u2014including DNC officials' disdain for Clinton rival Bernie Sanders, excerpts from her secret Wall Street speeches, and observations about her weaknesses as a candidate\u2014concerned matters of legitimate public interest. It was information that voters might rationally want to consider before deciding which candidate to support.\n\nValuable journalism is often based on information that was obtained or divulged illegally by people with axes to grind. It is hard to see how this case is different in principle. Is it the nationality of the informants that matters? If the emails that embarrassed Clinton had been swiped by Americans, would she still be talking about a democracy-threatening attack on our electoral process?\n\nLast fall, the Times \"obtained\" parts of Donald Trump's 1995 tax return and shared them with the public. If that information had come from a foreign source, would publishing it have undermined democracy?\n\nSuppose German hackers had managed to obtain complete copies of Trump's recent tax returns\u2014a subject of intense journalistic interest\u2014and shared them with news outlets, either directly or through an intermediary like Wikileaks. Would Clinton have perceived the resulting expos\u00e9s as undermining the electoral process or assisting it?\n\nCybersecurity is a serious concern, especially when it comes to systems that control important functions such as vote counting, banking, and the distribution of electricity. Helping politicians conceal facts that might alienate voters probably does not belong in the same category. Judging from the account in the Times, both the FBI and the DNC were remarkably lax in their initial responses to the intrusions that produced a bounty of newsworthy emails. Politicians with things to hide might want to be more careful about the security of the systems they use to discuss sensitive matters. But we should not confuse their challenge with a threat to democracy.",
    " Title: China Expresses Confidence in U.S. Trade Deal, Despite Trump's Tariff Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nChina has expressed confidence that it can reach a trade deal with the United States, despite fresh warnings from President Donald Trump that he may revert to imposing more tariffs if the two sides fail to resolve their differences. The Chinese Commerce Ministry made these remarks on Wednesday, following a period of relative quiet from Beijing after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday.\n\nIn a brief statement on its website, the ministry said China would work quickly to implement issues already agreed upon, as both sides \"actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and roadmap.\" The ministry called the latest bilateral talks \"very successful.\"\n\nTrump, via Twitter, held out the possibility of an extension of the ceasefire but warned tariffs would be reinstated if the talks failed to bear fruit. \"The negotiations with China have already started. Unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina,\" Trump tweeted. He said he would impose \"major tariffs\" on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry referred specific questions to the Commerce Ministry, which is due to hold its weekly news briefing on Thursday in Beijing. \"We hope the two working teams from both sides can, based on the consensus reached between the two countries' leaders, strengthen consultations, and reach a mutually beneficial agreement soon,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters.\n\nThe threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. However, the mood has quickly soured on skepticism that the two sides will be able to reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the short negotiating period agreed.\n\nFailure would raise the specter of a major escalation in the trade battle, with fresh U.S. tariff action and Chinese retaliation possibly as early as March. The White House says China had committed to start buying more American products and lifting tariff and non-tariff barriers immediately, while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection.\n\nSources told Reuters that Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume buying U.S. crude by March after the Xi-Trump deal reduced the risk of tariffs on those imports. China's crude oil imports from the U.S. had ground to a halt.\n\nGlobal financial markets tumbled on Tuesday as doubts over what could realistically be accomplished in the tight negotiating window added to concerns about fading global growth. The benchmark Shanghai stock index closed down 0.6 percent on Wednesday.\n\n\"Despite a temporary de-escalation of hostilities following the G-20 summit, the relationship between the U.S. and China will remain contentious,\" Moody's Investors Service said in a report. \"Narrow agreements and modest concessions in the ongoing trade dispute will not bridge the wide gulf in their respective economic, political, and strategic interests.\"\n\nOfficials from the U.S. and a number of other major economies have often criticized China for its slow approach to negotiations and not following through on commitments. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the meeting, and there have been some differences between U.S. and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails.\n\n\"Officials now face the difficult task of fleshing out a deal that is acceptable to the Chinese but also involves significant enough concessions not to be torpedoed by the China hawks in the Trump administration,\" Capital Economics said in a note this week. \"We would not be surprised if no agreement can be reached within 90 days, with the higher tariff rate coming into force only a few months later than originally planned.\"\n\nA Chinese official told Reuters officials were \"waiting for the leaders to return\" before publicizing details. President Xi and his most senior officials are due back in China on Thursday having visited Panama and Portugal since leaving Argentina.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Global Times tabloid, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party's main newspaper, said myriad statements from the Trump administration about the deal - including the agreement that China would buy $1.2 trillion in additional U.S. goods - were designed to highlight or even exaggerate facets of the deal that benefited the United States.\n\n\"Reaching an agreement within three months is a spur to not only China, but also the U.S. If the two sides fail to reach a deal, all the White House promises will be invalid,\" it said. \"It will be a win-win situation if a deal is realized. But if not, more fights and talks will continue alternately for a longer while. Chinese society should maintain a calm attitude.\"",

Du Bois Medal, the institution's highest honor in the field of African and African American Studies. The medal honors individuals who have made significant contributions to African American culture and the life of the mind.\n\nThe eight recipients of the 2021 W.E.B. Du Bois Medal are Colin Kaepernick, Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Bryan Stevenson, Kenneth Chenault, Shirley Ann Jackson, Pamela Joyner, and Florence Ladd.

    " Title: The Misinterpretation of Social Mobility in America: A Closer Look at the Distinction Between Opportunity and Achievement\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing number of studies suggest that America's upward mobility for individuals born in lower socioeconomic levels is limited. However, it is crucial to distinguish between upward \"mobility,\" defined as the opportunity to rise, and mobility defined as actual upward movement. This distinction is often overlooked in many studies.\n\nThe focus on the lack of upward mobility is frequently interpreted as a sign of societal unfairness, particularly when examining the disparity in career choices between the sons of high school dropouts and those of Ph.D. holders. If equal probabilities of achieving a specific goal is the definition of fairness, then it could be argued that life has never been fair, anywhere or any time in recorded history.\n\nIndividual aspirations and cultural differences play a significant role in the representation of various demographic groups in different fields. For instance, growing up in Harlem, the thought of becoming a ballet dancer never crossed the author's mind, and it is likely that the same was true for many growing up in New York's lower east side. This does not necessarily imply the existence of external barriers preventing individuals from pursuing certain careers.\n\nBarriers are external obstacles, as opposed to internal values and aspirations. The under-representation of women in computer engineering, for example, may not be the result of societal barriers but rather a reflection of women's own agendas and interests. Women, like other groups, may not be dedicated to fulfilling the prevailing ideology among the intelligentsia that every demographic group should be equally represented in all areas.\n\nOne recent celebrated statistical study of social mobility omits Asian Americans, a group whose achievements challenge the notion that upward mobility is limited in America. Immigrants from Asia, along with American-born Mormons, are among the groups whose achievements undermine the idea that upward mobility can seldom be realized in America.\n\nThose who preach this counterproductive message may never consider that the envy, resentment, and hopelessness they promote, as well as the welfare state they advocate for, are among the factors keeping people down. It is essential to approach the discussion of social mobility with a clear understanding of the distinction between opportunity and achievement, and to recognize the role of individual aspirations and cultural differences in shaping societal outcomes.",
    " Title: Conservative Commentator Ann Coulter Criticizes Sen. Marco Rubio's Immigration Reform Proposals\n\nArticle:\n\nConservative commentator Ann Coulter has joined a few other Republicans in criticizing Sen. Marco Rubio's immigration reform proposals, stating that the primary result of his amnesty plan would be to create more Democratic voters. In a column for Human Events, Coulter argued that some Republicans are attempting to create more Democratic voters through their immigration policies.\n\nCoulter's criticism follows similar sentiments from Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, who labeled Rubio's efforts to forge a bipartisan overhaul bill that grants citizenship to illegal immigrants as \"naive.\" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, without naming Rubio directly, also wrote this week that some in Congress are seeking \"quick fixes\" to the problem.\n\nIn her column, Coulter noted that Rubio's supporters claim his proposals are not amnesty, but rather enforcement-first measures. However, Coulter contends that Rubio's bill is, in fact, amnesty, stating, \"Despite all the blather about how Rubio demands 'Enforcement First,' the very first thing his proposal does is make illegal aliens legal.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio defended his efforts in a conversation with Rush Limbaugh, emphasizing the bipartisan nature of the group working on a comprehensive overhaul plan. Rubio stated that his efforts aim to avoid the problems that plagued the 1986 immigration bill, which granted amnesty to three million illegal immigrants but failed to provide more border security and tougher enforcement mechanisms.\n\nCoulter, however, asserts that \"Step One of Marco Rubio's plan is: Grant illegal aliens the right to live and work in America legally.\" She did not provide further details on the specifics of Rubio's plan.",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Speech: A Closer Look at Potential Contradictions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first major foreign policy address, former President Donald Trump presented a plan titled \"America First,\" which, according to some, contains contradictions and inconsistencies. The speech has sparked a political debate, with supporters praising Trump's critique of the Democratic establishment's approach, while critics, such as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, have pointed out \"simplistic slogans, contradictions, and misstatements\" in the speech.\n\nHere are ten passages that suggest Trump may be \"having his cake and eating it\":\n\n1. Trump stated that some groups \"will never be anything but our enemies,\" while later claiming, \"The world must know we do not go abroad in search of enemies.\"\n2. Trump criticized Obama for not paying for NATO membership, but also promised, \"America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again.\"\n3. Trump was ambiguous about America's role in promoting democracy, stating, \"We are getting out of the nation-building business,\" but also adding, \"I will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions.\"\n4. Trump called for Middle East nations to do more to fight Islamic extremism, but has recently offended much of the Muslim world by threatening to ban their citizens from entering the US.\n5. Criticisms of Obama's \"humiliations\" at the hands of foreign governments do not stand up to scrutiny, such as Trump's claim that Obama was snubbed during state visits due to a lack of a senior leader's greeting.\n6. Trump criticized Obama for failing to secure the 2016 Summer Games for Chicago, but it is unclear why he would have flown to the IOC meeting if the games were already secured.\n7. Trump claimed there are \"scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism,\" an assertion already open to dispute, and went on to say, \"for every case known to the public there are dozens and dozens more.\"\n8. Trump's slogan, \"America First,\" could be seen as an extension of his campaign promise to make America great again, but it also harks back to the America First Committee of the 1940s, a group set up to prevent the US from joining World War II.\n9. The speech contains a tension between its isolationism and interventionism, with Trump urging a pragmatic and realist approach, but also blasting Obama for having \"no vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy.\"\n10. Trump's statement, \"We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism,\" contradicts his previous statement, \"Do I look like a president? How handsome am I?\" made at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt is important to note that the speech was written by a number of people, and it may not be entirely reflective of Trump's personal views. The speech's textual analysis reveals potential contradictions and inconsistencies, but further investigation is needed to determine the accuracy of the statements made.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Advocates for Path to Citizenship and Expanded Executive Action on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech on immigration in Las Vegas on Tuesday, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton took a position to the left of President Barack Obama, proposing a more aggressive approach to the issue. As a presidential candidate, Clinton aims to revitalize the stalled debate and offer hope to the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States without legal status.\n\nClinton advocated for a path to citizenship for the undocumented, and pledged as president to take executive action more broadly than Obama has, to defer the deportations of those with strong community ties through family and work. She also promised to improve conditions for immigrant detainees, describing them as more humane.\n\nClinton's stance on immigration sets her apart from most Republican candidates in the 2016 presidential race. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a former advocate of sensible reform, now appears to support a provisional status for the undocumented, a long and difficult path to a temporary work permit. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, has been moderate in the past but is unclear on citizenship, with his position on the issue fluctuating and difficult to pin down.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin have more conservative views on immigration. Paul speaks compassionately of immigrants at times, but his agenda seems limited to sealing the border and ending the 14th Amendment guarantee of citizenship by birth. Walker has stated that every unauthorized immigrant should leave the country and also wants to limit legal immigration.\n\nIt is early in the campaign, and positions may shift. Clinton's public commitment to expansive immigration action is only a few hours old, and it remains to be seen whether she will prove to be a staunch defender of immigrants' rights. Last fall, Clinton was evasive when questioned by young immigrant advocates, known as Dreamers, with a non-answer: \"Elect more Democrats.\"",
    " Title: Trump Files Lawsuit to Prevent Banks from Handing Over Financial Records to Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has initiated a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One in an attempt to prevent them from complying with subpoenas issued by Democrat-led committees for information regarding his financial affairs. The lawsuit, filed on Monday in New York, aims to block the banks from adhering to subpoenas issued by the Democrat-controlled Congress, which is investigating the Trump family's financial dealings.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that there are no legitimate grounds for investigating the president's business affairs. Trump's three eldest children and the Trump Organization have also joined the lawsuit. The filing asserts that the subpoenas \"have no legitimate or lawful purpose\" and were issued to \"harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the president and his family.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank, one of the Trump Organization's major lenders, and a number of other financial institutions received subpoenas earlier this month from the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees. The committees are reportedly seeking documents and materials relating to the bank's longstanding relationship with Trump and his family.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stated that the subpoenas were part of an investigation \"into allegations of potential foreign influence on the US political process.\" Schiff and fellow Democrat Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, described the lawsuit as \"meritless.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, they said, \"This lawsuit shows the depths to which President Trump will go to obstruct Congress's constitutional oversight authority. He will find that Congress will not be deterred from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.\"\n\nIn 2017, Deutsche Bank rejected requests by Democrats in the House of Representatives to provide details of the president's finances, citing privacy laws. That year it was also reported that special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, had ordered Deutsche Bank to provide records of Trump's accounts.",
    " Title: US Summer Meal Program Provides Free Lunches for Over 3 Million Children Across the Country\n\nArticle:\n\nEvery summer, more than 3 million children across the United States receive free meals at over 30,000 sites, including schools, recreation centers, and migrant worker camps. This program, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, offers a valuable resource for families struggling financially, but it has also sparked controversy due to its open-door policy.\n\nAt the \"Summer Fun Cafe\" in northern California, and similar locations, meals are provided to at least half the children in the area who qualify for free lunches during the school year. During the summer, any child 18 and under can partake in these free meals, as stated by Monique Stovall, the nutrition director for the San Juan Unified School District outside Sacramento.\n\nSigns around the district headquarters advertise the fact that there is no eligibility requirement, inviting all children in the community to take advantage. This open invitation has led to concerns among some taxpayer watchdog groups, who question whether the program could be feeding children who may not be in need.\n\nJon Coupal, with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, wonders if the program could be unintentionally providing meals to children from families with high incomes, who may not be checking their eligibility. He questions, \"If someone is coming from a family that makes a quarter-of-a-million dollars a year, and they're not checking eligibility when they're coming in the door, I think most people would wonder, 'Am I paying for this?'\"\n\nFor low-income families, a free lunch means more money can be allocated towards other meals or necessities. For those who can afford to feed their children, it offers a convenient option.\n\nJulie Marks, a mother who brought her two young boys, stated, \"Normally we wouldn't qualify for a free lunch, but we're close and it's convenient, and my kids like it\u2014that's important.\"\n\nIn many cases, charity and nonprofit groups help sponsor free meal sites in their community. Program supporters argue that the summer lunch program is easier to administer when the location qualifies, as opposed to the user.\n\nMonique Stovall explained, \"We don't have to ask your income, because the overall purpose of the program is to provide a healthy meal to children.\"\n\nOrganizers contend that after a summer of nourishing meals, these children will do better when school resumes in the fall. Monitors are on hand to ensure that the lunch is eaten on site, and that adults do not take advantage of the program.",
    " Title: Senate Proposal Aims to Replace Columbus Day with Juneteenth as Federal Holiday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, Republican senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) have introduced an amendment to replace Columbus Day with Juneteenth as a federal holiday. The proposal, which follows a bipartisan Senate bill introduced by Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), aims to offset the cost associated with Cornyn's plan for establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday.\n\nThe amendment, introduced on June 10, 2020, is part of a growing movement to recognize Juneteenth, commemorating the day in 1865 when slavery definitively ended in the U.S., as a federal holiday. Currently, Juneteenth is celebrated as a holiday in 47 states.\n\nSenator Lankford stated, \"Throughout our history, we have strived to become a more perfect union and Juneteenth was a huge step in attaining that goal.\" He added, \"We should celebrate these strides on the federal level while remaining cognizant of the impact the existing 10 federal holidays have on federal services and local businesses.\"\n\nSenator Johnson also expressed support for the idea, stating, \"We support celebrating emancipation with a federal holiday, but believe we should eliminate a current holiday in exchange.\" He chose Columbus Day as a holiday that is lightly celebrated and least disruptive to Americans' schedules.\n\nJuneteenth has gained increased attention amid the nationwide protests that followed George Floyd's death in police custody. Protestors have torn down and vandalized statues of Christopher Columbus, an Italian Renaissance-era explorer often credited with being the first European to discover the Americas. A growing number of critics have called for Columbus Day to be eliminated or renamed Indigenous Peoples' Day, upset at the celebration of what they see as Columbus's subjugation and mistreatment of the New World's native population.\n\nSenator Cornyn told The Hill that eliminating Columbus Day in favor of Juneteenth is \"problematic\" and \"dilutes the message we're trying to send, which is one of being respectful and honoring and remembering our history.\" The cost associated with each new federal holiday for government employees is estimated to be $600 million in paid time off, according to a Fox News report.",
    " Title: House Passes Coronavirus Relief Bill After Intense Negotiations Between Democrats and Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events that unfolded over the weekend, the House of Representatives passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a bill aimed at providing relief in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The bill's passage followed a day of intense and chaotic negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, with uncertainty surrounding President Trump's support for the proposal.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, in a letter to fellow Democrats after 10 p.m. on Friday, acknowledged the intense negotiations required to secure the bill's passage by the weekend. She thanked her colleagues for their patience amid the frenetic back-and-forth with the administration.\n\nInitially, Pelosi had announced to her members shortly after 6 p.m. that she had reached a deal. However, House Republicans, including the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, had stated that talks were still ongoing, and a deal had not yet been reached.\n\nKey Republicans expressed concerns about the tax credit for paid family sick leave, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy advocating for more flexibility for small business owners who would be forced to offer paid leave to affected workers.\n\nThe confusion was further compounded by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's announcement on Fox Business that he had reached an agreement with Pelosi. Mnuchin's statement came after a meeting with Trump, which delayed his appearance on the network for so long that he ran out of time to speak before the program ended.\n\nPresident Trump eventually tweeted his support for the bill hours later, providing long-awaited relief to hundreds of members and aides who had spent 48 hours in limbo awaiting updates about the status of the funding package. Trump's tweet read, \"I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!\"\n\nOne of the other major obstacles involved in the negotiations was President Trump's personal demand for a payroll tax cut in this package. This idea has little support on Capitol Hill, and Democrats have already stated that it would be debated as part of future coronavirus crisis-related legislation at a later date.\n\nMcCarthy, who met with Trump and Mnuchin multiple times in the last 24 hours, confirmed that Trump had sought the last-minute addition. He also stated that Republicans would push for it in Congress's next tranche of economic relief, which could come later this month or in April.\n\n\"I believe this will not be the only one,\" McCarthy said, alluding to future aid packages related to the outbreak. \"This is something that the president wants, we would have liked to have that as well. I think that would have taken a little more time.\"",
    " Title: GOP Faces Division on Healthcare Reform as ObamaCare Replacement Effort Stalls\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican party is currently grappling with competing ideas on how to proceed with healthcare reform following the collapse of the current ObamaCare replacement effort. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged on Monday that the Senate's current approach would fail after two more senators announced opposition to the current healthcare draft.\n\nWithout the necessary votes, McConnell stated that the Senate will take up a repeal-only bill that Congress passed in 2015. \"Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\nThe repeal-only approach is supported by conservatives, who argue that Congress should simply pass again what it already approved in 2015. President Trump joined the conservatives, tweeting Monday night, \"Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!\"\n\nHowever, the repeal-only bill does not appear to have the votes to pass, and other GOP lawmakers called Monday for working with Democrats or passing an alternative GOP bill. A separate repeal was the initial GOP strategy at the beginning of this year and ended up being rejected due to a lack of votes to pass.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) wrote in The Washington Post last week, \"There must be a replace with repeal.\" In a report that could unsettle moderates, the Congressional Budget Office previously found that the 2015 repeal-only bill would lead to 32 million more uninsured people over a decade, with premiums nearly doubling.\n\nConservatives, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), called for a clean repeal vote on Monday night. \"Clean repeal now!\" tweeted Sen. Paul. \"Time for full repeal of # Obamacare \u2014 let's put the same thing on President Trump's desk that we put on President Obama's desk,\" added Rep. Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nIn contrast, other Republicans, such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), called for working with Democrats on a new plan. McCain is currently recovering from surgery, which prompted a delay in consideration of the bill this week. Some Republicans have raised the idea of a bipartisan bill to stabilize ObamaCare markets, which could include funding for key payments to insurers known as cost-sharing reductions and possibly funding to bring down premiums for high-cost enrollees, known as \"reinsurance.\"\n\nHowever, conservative members, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), have objected to the idea of a stabilization bill as simply throwing more money at the healthcare law. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) put forward a third approach on Monday night, touting a bill he recently proposed with Sen. Cassidy to give states a chunk of money and let them decide whether to keep much of ObamaCare or try something new. That approach has been attacked from both the left and right.",
    " Title: President Trump Surprises Troops in Afghanistan, Holds Secret Thanksgiving Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, President Donald Trump made a surprise visit to Afghanistan on Thanksgiving morning to express gratitude to troops for their service and to share a turkey dinner. The visit required stringent security measures to maintain secrecy and prevent leaks.\n\nUpon arrival, President Trump addressed the troops, stating, \"There's nowhere I'd rather spend Thanksgiving than with the toughest, fiercest warriors.\" He continued, \"I'm here to say Happy Thanksgiving and thank you very much. As president of the United States, I have no higher honor than serving as commander in chief.\"\n\nThe journey began on Wednesday, with the president departing from Mar-a-Lago undercover. Details of the departure are scarce, but it is known that Trump flew out of an undisclosed airport in Florida on a small, undisclosed plane in the evening.\n\nThe flight to Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, had only one Fox News journalist, who served as the pool reporter. The plane was sparsely furnished, with four blue leather chairs and a portable toilet brought for the occasion. To maintain security, phones were confiscated from all onboard, including senior White House officials.\n\nUpon landing at Joint Base Andrews, Trump switched to Air Force One, which was hidden in a hangar. The plane took off from JBA with all interior lights off and the windows drawn. The plane landed in Afghanistan on a pitch-black runway, and the pool was only allowed to take pictures of Trump's arrival from a nearby van.\n\nAccompanying Trump were White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere, and Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). Grisham revealed that only a tight circle of White House officials knew about the trip, and the White House even scheduled tweets to be sent out during the Internet blackout that the president faced.\n\n\"It's a dangerous area, and he (the President) wants to support the troops,\" Grisham said. \"He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there are a lot of people who are away from their families during the holidays, and we thought it would be a nice surprise.\"\n\nThe visit took many by surprise, including some news outlets. Newsweek had to rewrite an article that initially reported the president would spend the day tweeting and playing golf.\n\nAfter serving and dining with the troops, President Trump met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Due to security concerns, Ghani was notified only a few hours before the meeting. Trump then addressed a few hundred cheering troops in the hangar on the airfield, bringing Ghani on stage to also express appreciation to the American troops. Trump told them that everyone was working hard to bring them back home.\n\n\"We will continue to work tirelessly for the day when all of you can go home to your families... and that day is coming very soon,\" he said.",

One officer shouted, \"We need everyone to move back past Downing Street.\"\n\nRadoslaw Sikorski, a former foreign minister of Poland who was in the area, was in a taxi on Westminster Bridge when pedestrians were hit by the car. \"I didn't see the impact, I heard it\u2014it sounded like a car hitting a sheet of metal,\" he said. \"I saw these people lying on the tarmac, on the pavement. I saw five people down, one unconscious and one bleeding heavily from his head.

Seeing the commotion, he initially thought an action movie was being shot, but quickly discerned the gravity of the situation as the bus was evacuated and he saw the vehicle that had crashed into a railing.\n\n\"We had a front-row seat as the first responders arrived,\" Mr. Bone said. \"I am of the generation who remembers I.R.A. bombs in London during the Troubles,\" he said, referring to the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. \"We are not indifferent, but police have reacted with calm. I saw no panic.\"\n\nBritain has not suffered a large-scale terrorist attack since July 7, 2005, when bomb attacks on subway trains and on a bus killed more than 50 people. Political violence is relatively rare in Britain, where gun ownership is stringently restricted.\n\nJo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament, was assassinated in her constituency in northern England on June 16, a week before the contentious referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union.\n\nIn 1979, a lawmaker was assassinated near the Parliament building. Airey Neave, a Conservative Party member, was killed when his car was blown up.\n\nJeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that the London attack was consistent with the recent pattern of attacks in which a vehicle was used to kill people, citing assaults in France, Germany, and Israel.\n\n\"We've seen a gradual movement away from terrorist attacks on the West to attacks on softer and softer targets with more improvised weapons,\" he said. \"In a way, it's a sign of desperation and a demonstration of the effectiveness of counterterrorism in the West.

    " Title: Trump Drops John Ratcliffe as U.S. Spy Chief Nominee, Considering Alternatives\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday withdrew his choice of John Ratcliffe to be the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) after questions arose about the congressman's lack of experience and possible exaggerations in his resume. This marks the latest upheaval over a top national security post.\n\nTrump announced the move five days after he surprised many in Washington by making the conservative Republican lawmaker from Texas his selection to replace Daniel Coats as DNI. The vacancy comes as the U.S. intelligence community grapples with an array of challenges, including the threat of foreign interference in next year's U.S. elections, the impact of a rising China, escalating tensions with Iran, North Korea's nuclear program, and the desire to end years of conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the situation, Trump is considering Republican Representatives Michael McCaul and Devin Nunes for the job. McCaul is a former chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, and Nunes is a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Trump told reporters at the White House he has \"a list of three people\" he will consider for the job this weekend.\n\nRatcliffe, a Trump loyalist and the most junior member of the House Intelligence Committee, had been tapped but not formally nominated to replace Coats. \"Rather than going through months of slander and libel, I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people,\" Trump said on Twitter. Ratcliffe, 53, faced a potentially difficult Senate confirmation process.\n\nThe change in leadership at the top of the U.S. intelligence community comes after a half-year of turmoil atop the Pentagon. The Senate on July 23 confirmed Army Secretary Mark Esper as defense secretary, ending the longest period that the Pentagon had been without a permanent top official, a stint that began after James Mattis resigned in December over policy differences with Trump. Trump's previous pick for defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, withdrew in June after reports of domestic violence in his family.\n\nThe post of DNI was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Ratcliffe, confirming he had withdrawn from consideration, said he thought the confirmation process would become a partisan battle between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nRatcliffe gained attention by defending Trump and criticizing former Special Counsel Robert Mueller during a July hearing on Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Although Ratcliffe had touted his counter-terrorism experience as a federal prosecutor in Texas, media outlets including \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported on concerns that he may have exaggerated his achievements in the post.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and some former senior U.S. intelligence officers had said Ratcliffe lacked the expertise and experience to replace Coats. Some voiced concern that he would warp U.S. intelligence to support Trump's views. Ratcliffe served for six months on the intelligence panel.\n\nTrump said he might name the No. 2 intelligence official, Sue Gordon, as acting DNI. That is required when there is a vacancy in the top job. Such a move would likely be reassuring to many U.S. intelligence experts because of her deep experience. However, some Trump allies, according to the source familiar with the matter, were floating the possibility of instead naming CIA Director Gina Haspel as acting director until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said while he was \"heartened\" that the office of the DNI has an experienced team in place during the transition, \"there is no substitute for having a Senate-confirmed director in place\" leading it. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, a critic of Ratcliffe for the job, said in a statement, \"The next Director of National Intelligence must be someone who is nonpartisan, sees the world objectively, and speaks truth to power.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters as he departs for travel to Bedminster, New Jersey from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., August 2, 2019. \u2588\u2588\u2588/Leah Millis\n\nRatcliffe joined a growing list of Trump's choices for senior jobs who have had to withdraw, leading to questions about the rigorousness of White House background checks. Asked whether Ratcliffe's history was inadequately reviewed before he was picked, Trump defended the White House process. While Trump regularly attacks the media, he told reporters, \"You're part of the vetting process... We save a lot of money that way.\"",
    " Title: Major US Retailers Implement New Gun Sales Restrictions Following Florida School Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo major U.S. retailers, Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart, have announced new restrictions on gun sales following the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods, with over 600 stores, has decided to stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, and will not sell any firearms to anyone under the age of 21. The company had previously stopped selling such weapons at its main shops after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting but 35 shops run by a subsidiary called Field & Stream had continued to do so.\n\nWalmart, the largest seller of guns in the U.S., has raised the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years and will remove items from its website that resemble assault-style rifles. The retailer stopped selling high-powered rifles in its shops in 2015, citing low demand.\n\nIn a statement, Walmart said, \"We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms.\"\n\nIn Washington, President Donald Trump urged a group of lawmakers with diverse views to come up with a comprehensive bipartisan solution in a televised meeting. Republican leaders in Congress have rejected raising the minimum legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, but Mr. Trump said he \"would give pretty serious thought to it.\"\n\nDick's Sporting Goods, in announcing its policy change, said, \"We have tremendous respect and admiration for the students organizing and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country.\" The company added, \"We have heard you. The nation has heard you.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, pressure has mounted on U.S. politicians to act on gun control and for corporations to cut ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA). Firms including Hertz car rental, United Airlines, and Delta Airlines have ended discounts to NRA members.\n\nOn Wednesday, a teacher in the state of Georgia was arrested after barricading himself in a classroom and firing a handgun. No one was injured.\n\nAt Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a line of police officers, school staff, and community members bearing flowers greeted some 3,000 students who returned to classes on Wednesday morning. There were also many reporters, shouting questions to the teenagers about how they felt.\n\nLyliah Skinner, a 16-year-old student, told the BBC before she left home, \"We're not going to really be learning much today - it's all about healing.\" She also said she was feeling nervous \"because I'm scared it's going to happen again.\" Lyliah listed people she knew who would not be returning, including Joaquin Oliver, who sat just in front of her in a class they shared.\n\nDavid Hogg, a senior student and now leading activist, was also feeling trepidation. It was \"really hard to think about\" what occurred two weeks ago, he said. \"Imagine getting in a plane crash and having to get back on the same plane again and again and being expected to learn and act like nothing's wrong,\" he told NBC News.\n\nThe handling of the shooting by authorities sparked criticism after it emerged that the FBI and local police had failed to follow up on multiple tips about the shooter, and that an armed deputy at the school had stayed outside the school building while the attack took place.\n\nThe school's Building 12, the site of the shootings, will remain closed and cordoned off indefinitely. Members of Florida's State House and Senate will soon begin reviewing proposed bills related to firearms, which need their approval and also that of Governor Rick Scott.\n\nAmong other restrictions, they would raise the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and give police more control to seize weapons from mentally ill people. A controversial $67m voluntary program to arm school staff, including teachers, would ensure they were trained by law enforcement and allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus, according to the New York Times.",
    " Title: Power Cuts Plague Middle Eastern Countries, Affecting Daily Life and Infrastructure\n\nArticle:\n\nA power cut in the midst of a hysterectomy operation in an Egyptian hospital last month left doctors scrambling for alternatives, with a handful of cellphones providing the necessary light. This incident is not an isolated example of the power outages that plague the Middle East, where conflict and severe economic strife have led to regular power cuts.\n\nIn Egypt, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi acknowledged the issue in a half-hour, nationally televised speech, attributing the outages to crumbling infrastructure that requires billions of dollars and time to fix. The outages have caused frustration and anger among the public, with the power cuts lasting for several hours in some cases.\n\nIn neighboring Libya, power outages have been common since the 2011 revolution against dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Rival militias in the capital Tripoli have fought for control of the city's international airport since mid-July, affecting many aspects of life, including power supply.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has also struggled with power outages, with power sources meeting no more than 70% of the population's needs before its recent war with Israel. The Gaza Strip's only power plant was hit by Israeli shelling, which also damaged transformers and electrical wires, hindering flows of power coming from Israel.\n\nIn Iraq, power outages have been a problem since the rule of Saddam Hussein, with electrical flows growing more chaotic over time. In Lebanon, power cuts are so routine that apps for Apple and Android devices were created to let users track them. An ongoing strike by electrical company workers threatens to make matters worse in Lebanon, as limited state funds and increased demand from an influx of more than 1 million Syrian refugees have led to a rise in power rationing.\n\nIn Syria, power cuts have hit Damascus, while some parts of Aleppo had no power at all at the end of June. Other districts had less than one hour a day, according to the United Nations. The problem contributes to worsening health conditions.\n\nThe power outages have affected daily life, infrastructure, and the economy in these countries, with many people resorting to generators to keep their homes and businesses running. However, the poor cannot afford them, and the lack of a reliable power supply has led to the spoilage of refrigerated medicines and vaccinations, sewage flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, and agricultural irrigation suffering.\n\nIn the Gaza Strip, life without electricity can hardly be managed, according to Khalil Abu Shammala, director of the Al Dameer Association for Human Rights. In Baghdad, where stifling summer temperatures routinely hang above 110 degrees, many people have generators, but the poor cannot afford them.\n\nThe power outages have been a long-standing issue in the Middle East, with some areas experiencing power cuts since the rule of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. However, the situation has grown more chaotic over time, with the power cuts lasting for several hours in some cases. The leaders of these countries have acknowledged the issue and have pledged to invest in infrastructure to address the problem, but the process will take time and significant investment.",
    " Title: New Zealand Implements Immediate Ban on Assault Rifles Following Christchurch Mosque Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Thursday the immediate ban on all assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, and military-style semi-automatic rifles in response to the nation's deadliest massacre in history, which occurred on March 15 in Christchurch. The ban, which will be followed by legislation next month, requires New Zealand citizens to make arrangements to turn in weapons banned under the new laws.\n\nArdern stated that the alleged shooter in the attacks at two Christchurch mosques killed most of the 50 victims with two legally purchased semi-automatic rifles modified with 30-plus round magazines, effectively turning them into military-style semi-automatic weapons. An amnesty will be put in place for weapons to be handed in by citizens, and the New Zealand cabinet will implement a buyback plan for banned weapons. Tightly regulated exemptions will be made for some owners, such as hunters and farmers.\n\nArdern emphasized that the vast majority of legitimate gun owners in New Zealand will understand that these measures are in the national interest and will take these changes in their stride. She also noted that gun ownership is \"a privilege and not a right\" in New Zealand.\n\nSince the attacks, Ardern has led a nation trying to grieve and work through the news of the killings, which, in total, rival the annual number of murders in New Zealand. On Tuesday, Ardern told New Zealand's Parliament that tough gun laws were coming and that she would deny the man responsible for the nation's worst terror attack in modern history the one thing he likely craved: fame.\n\nArdern opened her speech to lawmakers in New Zealand by using the Arabic greeting \"As-salamu alaykum,\" which translates as \"Peace be upon you.\" In her speech, she condemned the suspect in the attacks, stating, \"You may have chosen us, but we utterly reject and condemn you.\"\n\nNew Zealand has fewer restrictions on rifles or shotguns than many countries. Handguns are more tightly controlled. About 1.5 million firearms are owned \u2013 legally and illegally \u2013 by civilians in New Zealand, according to police data tracked by GunPolicy.org, a website run in conjunction with the University of Sydney. This equates to about 30 firearms per 100 people. In the United States, the rate is approximately 120 firearms per 100 people, according to the site.\n\nAll gun owners in New Zealand must have a license, which they can get from age 16 (age 18 for semi-automatic weapons), but the weapon itself does not need to be registered with authorities, according to the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, a New Zealand lobby group. Ardern said the suspect in Friday's attacks had a license and owned five guns. The majority of firearm owners in New Zealand are farmers or hunters.\n\nAccording to GunPolicy.org, New Zealand is among a handful of countries where police officers are routinely unarmed when they are on patrol. Officers in Britain, Ireland, Norway, and Iceland also carry firearms only in special circumstances.\n\nAustralia and Britain both changed their gun laws in response to mass shootings. The Australian government overhauled its gun laws in 1996 after 35 people were murdered during a shooting spree in Tasmania. Australia banned all semi-automatic weapons and restricted certain handguns. It offered to buy back prohibited firearms.\n\nA 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that Australia had not had a fatal mass shooting \u2013 one in which five or more people are killed \u2013 since the 1996 shooting. In the 18 years prior to the new laws, there were 13.\n\nThe turning point for Britain came in 1996, when a man used a legally owned handgun to kill 16 young children and a teacher at a school in Dunblane, Scotland. In the aftermath, all private ownership of handguns was banned. Since then, there has been one mass shooting, in 2010, in Britain.\n\nThe death toll in the attack at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques rose to 50 people Saturday; victims range in age from 2 to over 60. Services for the victims were held at churches across the country Sunday, and people laid flowers at memorial sites. A group of bikers performed the haka \u2013 a traditional ceremonial dance of New Zealand's Maori people \u2013 at the memorial in Christchurch. Thirty-nine people remain in the hospital, and 11 were in intensive care in critical condition.",
    " Title: Call for Proscription of Order of Nine Angles as Terrorist Organization\n\nArticle:\n\nAnti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate has called for the British government to outlaw the neo-Nazi Satanist group Order of Nine Angles (ONA) as a terrorist organization. In their annual State of Hate report, Hope Not Hate argues that the ONA should be added to the list of proscribed terrorist groups, which is currently under review by the Home Office.\n\nLast week, two British extreme right-wing organizations were added to the list, one of which, Sonnenkrieg Division, is influenced by the ONA's Nazi-Satanist ideology. In the past year, four teenagers linked to the ideology have been jailed in the UK for terror offenses, with one convicted of preparing for a terror attack by following instructions set out in ONA texts.\n\nIn court, prosecutors described the ONA as \"self-consciously, explicitly malevolent\" and the \"most prominent and recognizable link between Satanism and the extreme right.\" The anti-racist campaign group, which investigates violent extremism, argues that the group's \"sick ideas have drawn in young extremists in the UK and elsewhere, and have helped nourish a dangerous culture of unprecedented depravity amongst the extreme right, which has none of the moral constraints that previous generations of far-right activists had.\"\n\nYvette Cooper MP, chair of the home affairs select committee, has urged the home secretary to immediately refer the ONA to the government's proscription review group. \"The combination of Nazi-Satanism, extreme violence, and sexual abuse makes it particularly troubling, and action needs to be taken to prevent them from grooming and radicalizing other people,\" she said.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson stated that action is being taken to \"root out and dismantle the groups that promote extreme right-wing views and we are giving police the tools and resources they need to tackle this threat.\" The spokesperson added that the list of proscribed organizations is kept under review. Counter-terrorism police have previously spoken about the increasing amount of work relating to \"niche ideologies\" such as violent Satanism.",
    " Title: Biden's Moderate Label Reflects Shift in Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden addressed union workers at the Teamsters Local 249 hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 29, 2019.\n\nThe labeling of Biden as a moderate is indicative of the significant shift towards the left within the Democratic Party. At the time of writing, Biden, the most recent candidate to file for the Democratic presidential nomination, is considered a moderate. This characterization underscores both the rapid movement of the party to the left and the liberal lean of the national press.\n\nA Democratic politician is now considered a moderate if they believe in preserving private health insurance and opposing the implementation of a government system, restricting third-trimester abortions, and maintaining deportation as a key aspect of the immigration regime. These positions were once considered compatible with liberal Democratic ideology, as recently as three years ago when Biden was vice president. However, they are now being criticized by left-wing activists who hold significant influence in the party's primaries.\n\nIn the progressive media, Biden is facing criticism for not expanding his indictment of President Donald Trump to include an indictment of America for electing him.\n\nAs the primary race progresses, there is a possibility that Biden may shift his positions further left to appeal to the party's base. He has already denounced the legal system as \"white man's law,\" which may be a reference to its respect for the presumption of innocence. Clarity on this matter is sought from Biden regarding his comments.\n\nThroughout his career, Biden has been a strong, albeit not wholly consistent, supporter of left-wing causes, including higher taxes, hate-crimes laws, and liberal judicial activism. Conservatives should not be deceived into thinking Biden is a moderate, and neither should actual moderates.",

The Trump administration has prioritized the return of American hostages during his presidency. During the announcement of al-Baghdadi's death last weekend, President Trump named some of the innocent Americans who were killed by ISIS, including James Foley and Kayla Mueller.\n\nDianne Foley, the mother of American journalist James Foley, who was beheaded by ISIS in 2014, expressed gratitude for the president's actions but emphasized the need for further assistance. Kayla Mueller's parents, who conducted a private investigation outside of the government after their daughter was kidnapped in 2013 while serving as an aid worker, praised Trump's actions but called for more focus on finding and rescuing American hostages.\n\nCarl and Marsha Mueller, Kayla Mueller's parents, have found intelligence that they believe the U.S. government has not, but have yet to find their daughter's body. Marsha Mueller stated she was \"just numb\" when she heard the president's announcement. She expressed the need for the U.S. government's help in locating and rescuing American hostages.\n\nThe Muellers have been advocating for their daughter's return since her kidnapping in 2013.

    " Title: Pennsylvania Congressman Tim Murphy Faces Allegations of Hypocrisy in Abortion Case\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Tim Murphy, a vocal anti-abortion congressman from Pennsylvania, is facing allegations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he asked his girlfriend to terminate a pregnancy this year. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published the story on Tuesday, citing documents they obtained.\n\nAccording to the report, Shannon Edwards, a Pittsburgh woman half Murphy's age with whom he admitted to having an extramarital affair, texted Murphy in January about a possible pregnancy that turned out to be a false alarm. Edwards reportedly texted, \"You have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options.\"\n\nMurphy, in response, reportedly admitted to the post-abortion stance but distanced himself from the anti-abortion messages on his professional Facebook account, stating, \"I've never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff don't write any more. I will.\"\n\nThe revelation has sparked controversy, as Murphy is a pro-life congressman who has advocated for the U.S. government to define life as beginning at conception, a stance that would outlaw some forms of birth control and force every woman to birth any conceived fetus against her will. The congressman is a current sponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that would ban abortion care provided after 20 weeks' gestation, defying the protections enshrined by Roe v. Wade. The House is set to vote on the bill on Tuesday.\n\nMurphy is not the first anti-abortion legislator to face allegations of hypocrisy. Anti-abortion Representative Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, who is still in office, supported his wife's two abortions and was recorded telling a 24-year-old woman with whom he was having an affair that she had to have an abortion \"to get this solved and get it over with so we can get on with our lives.\" DesJarlais, like Murphy, is also a sponsor of the 20-week abortion ban.",

    " Title: Trump Administration to Provide $12 Billion in Emergency Aid to Farmers Amid Ongoing Trade Disputes\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump reiterated his support for tariffs on Tuesday via Twitter, stating that the tariffs are \"the greatest\" and that the United States will either negotiate fair trade deals or impose tariffs. The administration is reportedly planning to provide $12 billion in emergency aid to farmers to cope with the financial turmoil caused by the tariffs, according to Politico.\n\nFarmers have been among the hardest hit by Trump's protectionist trade policies, as foreign countries have retaliated with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs on American agricultural products. China, Mexico, and Canada have imposed tariffs on soybeans, dairy, pork, apples, and potatoes, among other US products, in response to the Trump administration's taxes on imported steel, aluminum, and electronics.\n\nThe impact of tariffs on US agriculture has been significant. Prices for agricultural products like soybeans have dropped to a 10-year low since Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on trade and aluminum earlier this year. Farmers across various markets have grown increasingly concerned about the future of their businesses due to the ongoing trade war.\n\nThe administration's plan, which has yet to be formally released, is reported to consist of three programs: direct financial assistance for farmers, a purchase and distribution program where the government buys up surplus agricultural products and redistributes them for low-income food assistance, and a trade promotion program.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that this stabilization package will utilize a Depression-era program that allows the government to borrow up to $30 billion from the Treasury without congressional approval.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), who chairs the House Agricultural Committee, expressed confidence last week that the administration would take action to help farmers \"persevere\" during this period.\n\n\"The president has great agriculture advisers around him, and his public comments indicate that he understands this is troubling to the folks in the production of agriculture in Middle America,\" Conaway said. \" [ Agriculture Secretary ] Sonny Perdue has some tools that he's working on to mitigate in some small way the impact the tariffs are having.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump appears to remain steadfast in his tariff agenda, having already threatened to tax foreign car imports ahead of trade talks with the European Union this week and tweeting a positive outlook on the tariffs' impact on the American economy.\n\n\"I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!\" Trump tweeted earlier this month.\n\nTrump's tariffs have disproportionately affected farmers, and it remains unclear when the trade disputes will end. Agriculture has low barriers to trade, making the industry an easy target for retaliatory tariffs. Already, Mexico, China, and Canada have retaliated to the United States' newly placed steel and aluminum tariffs with tariffs of their own.\n\n\"It's one of the few areas that the US has a surplus; it makes sense they would target that,\" Chad Hart, a crops market specialist with Iowa State University, told \u2588\u2588\u2588, adding that there's a political strategy element as well. \"It makes sense politically because you are looking at Republican leadership, and farmers do tend to vote more Republican.\"\n\nThe US has approximately $140 billion in agricultural exports per year. Canada and Mexico are major trade partners, together importing about $39 billion. China, Japan, and South Korea import around $39 billion, and Europe makes up around a $12 billion share of agricultural imports. However, tensions are high across the board.\n\nWhile many farmers are Republicans and Trump supporters\u2014and generally can get behind Trump's call to equalize the playing field\u2014one Wisconsin dairy farmer, Roger Mehre, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier in July that farmers in his circles are growing increasingly nervous.\n\n\"I almost get the feeling that [Trump] is trying to be a bully and he is making these countries bow to him, and that's just not going to happen,\" Mehre said, pointing out that it's not just dairy that's affected; it's pork, soybeans, corn, poultry\u2014the list goes on. \"We need them, and they need us. Both sides are going to lose.\"\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has attempted to assure farmers they'll be protected from any trade wars, and this emergency aid package is certainly a step to mitigate financial disaster. However, farmers don't have a clear idea of what the president's endgame is, and Trump hasn't tread lightly with his rhetoric. It's something Republican lawmakers from agriculture-heavy states, like Sens. Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), have warned the administration about.\n\n\"This is dumb,\" Sasse said in a statement in May. \"Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don't treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We've been down this road before\u2014blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression.\"\n\nTrump does seem aware of the potential political fallout. But for now, he's trying to convince farmers to stick with him\u2014and his administration is attempting to stanch the bleeding with billions in emergency aid.",

The rescue operation ended early Wednesday, as reported by NPR's Corey Flintoff for our Newscast unit. The other crew member was reportedly found dead on Tuesday by a Syrian rebel group.\n\nThe incident has escalated international tensions, with both countries exchanging angry rhetoric while calling for military restraint. The Russian Su-24 fighter jet was reportedly flying over Syria when it was shot down by Turkish F-16s, according to Russian officials. Turkey claims the jet was in Turkish airspace and was warned 10 times before being targeted.\n\nRussia maintains the jet was flying over Syria at the time. Both crew members appeared to eject from the jet and parachute to the ground, but one was reportedly found dead Tuesday by a Syrian rebel group. Russia now says the other crew member has been rescued in a 12-hour operation. Rebel fighters in the area claim they shot one of the Russian helicopters involved in the search yesterday and then used a missile to destroy it on the ground after it was forced to land. Russia says one of the helicopter crewmen was killed, but the rest were evacuated safely.\n\nRussia and Turkey continue to exchange heated statements. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Wednesday that Russia could not justify its attacks on ethnic Turks in Syria under the pretext of fighting the Islamic State, and reiterated statements by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Turkey will continue to defend its airspace. However, Davutoglu said targeting Russia is \"out of the question.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the shooting of the plane a \"planned provocation\" that is prompting Moscow to \"reconsider relations with Ankara.\" On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the shooting a \"stab in the back.\" However, Lavrov says Moscow has \"no intention to go to war with Turkey.\"\n\nRussia is reportedly deploying an advanced anti-aircraft system to its base in Syria. The missiles appear to be guarding against Turkish planes or planes from other coalition members, such as the U.S. or France. As far as we know, ISIS and other jihadi groups in Syria have no aircraft that could threaten the Russian base.\n\nMoscow may be considering nonmilitary forms of retaliation against Turkey. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Wednesday that \"important joint projects could be canceled and Turkish firms could lose Russian market share.\" The two countries' economies are closely linked by energy purchases, tourism, and other business activity.",

The senators have been working on a plan that would provide a longer extension of the debt limit and government funding, as well as a two-year delay on the 2.3% tax on medical devices.\n\nOn Monday, Manchin told CNN's Chris Cuomo that they are making progress and have a \"good template\" for the plan. Collins also told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday morning that the conversations have been \"very constructive\" and that they are not releasing any details until they have an agreement.\n\nHowever, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) rejected the plan on Saturday, stating that it \"is not going to go anyplace at this stage.\" Reid expressed that while the plan opens the government and extends the debt ceiling, there is little agreement with the Democrats on other aspects of the plan.\n\nThe Senate voted on a separate procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached on Saturday, but the measure fell short of the 60 votes needed to proceed. The Senate will reconvene Monday at 2 p.m. ET, while the House meets at noon.\n\nA key sticking point for Democrats is sequestration, as the Collins' plan gives \"flexibility\" on the spending cuts, but Democrats and the White House do not want to agree to anything that allows another round of the spending limits to kick in as they are supposed to in mid-January.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee), who has been working closely with Manchin and Collins on the deal, said he has reason to believe the Senate will come to an agreement Monday.\n\nBefore leaving Capitol Hill on Sunday, Reid struck a positive note as he spoke on the Senate floor, stating, \"I've had a productive conversation with the Republican leader this afternoon. Our discussions were substantive, and we'll continue those discussions. I'm optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion.\"",
    " Title: Clinton Interviewed by FBI in Email Investigation; Trump Calls for Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nPresumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump called for charges to be filed against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Saturday following her meeting with the FBI regarding the agency's investigation into her use of a private email server for official correspondence.\n\n\"It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton,\" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. \"What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign stated that the voluntary meeting, which took place at FBI headquarters in Washington, lasted about three-and-a-half hours. Clinton's campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, would have no further comment about the interview.\n\nThe Clinton campaign issued the statement Saturday shortly before 12:30 p.m. ET, minutes after Clinton returned to her Washington home and then departed again about 30 minutes later.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus stated, \"Hillary Clinton has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the FBI as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct.\" He continued, \"We must ask ourselves if this is the kind of leadership we want in the White House.\"\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the FBI or Justice Department Saturday.\n\nClinton's use of a private server and email address, and whether classified information was mishandled as a result of that setup, has cast a shadow over her campaign from the start. The FBI investigation is purportedly coming to a close, and the Clinton interview is considered among the final steps in the case.\n\nTrump has seized on the email issue and repeatedly said the probe undermines Clinton's fitness for office. Trump has called his opponent \"Crooked Hillary\" and said she cannot be trusted in the White House.\n\nClinton has argued that she is more trustworthy than Trump on handling the issues that matter to most Americans: foreign policy, national security, and running the economy. However, the email investigation has lingered throughout her campaign, and Trump has asserted that Clinton will receive leniency from a Democratic administration.\n\nEarlier this week, the entire, ongoing email scandal grew when Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, initiated an impromptu meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her airplane in Phoenix.\n\n\"The American people need to have confidence that the Obama Justice Department is conducting a fair and impartial investigation,\" Priebus also said. \"When the attorney general meets secretly with Bill Clinton just days before Hillary's interrogation is conducted discreetly over a holiday weekend, it raises serious concerns about special treatment.\"\n\nThere was already speculation about whether an agency under the Obama administration could conduct an unbiased probe, which only intensified after Clinton met with Lynch, a President Obama appointee who decides whether to bring charges in the case. Lynch says she will accept whatever recommendations she receives from the agency's career prosecutors and lawyers.\n\nClinton has said relying on a private server was a mistake but that other secretaries of state had also used a personal email address. The matter was referred for investigation last July by the inspectors general for the State Department and intelligence community following the discovery of emails that they said contained classified information.\n\nThe State Department's inspector general, the agency's internal watchdog, said in a blistering audit in May that Clinton and her team ignored clear warnings from State Department officials that her email setup violated federal standards and could leave sensitive material vulnerable to hackers. Clinton declined to talk to the inspector general, but the audit reported that Clinton feared \"the personal being accessible\" if she used a government email account.\n\nAgents have already interviewed top Clinton aides including her former State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, a longtime aide who is currently the vice chairwoman of Clinton's campaign. The staffer who set up the server, Bryan Pagliano, was granted limited immunity from prosecution by the Justice Department last fall in exchange for his cooperation. The FBI, as a matter of course, seeks to interview individuals central to an investigation before concluding its work.\n\nThe emails were routed through a server located in the basement of Clinton's New York home during her tenure as the nation's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. Dozens of the emails sent or received by Clinton through her private server were later determined to contain classified material. Clinton has repeatedly said that none of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent or received. As part of the probe, she has turned over the hard drive from her email server to the FBI.",
    " Title: Satellite Images Confirm Destruction of Oldest Christian Monastery in Iraq by Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nSatellite images obtained by the Associated Press have confirmed the destruction of St Elijah's Monastery, the oldest Christian monastery in Iraq, by the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). The monastery, known as Deir Mar Elia, stood on a hill near the northern city of Mosul for 1,400 years before its alleged demolition in late 2014, soon after IS seized the city.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the images indicate the monastery was demolished between August and September 2014. Stephen Wood of Allsource Analysis told AP that the satellite images published on Wednesday showed that the stone walls have been \"literally pulverized.\" Bulldozers, heavy equipment, sledgehammers, and possibly explosives were used to destroy the monastery completely.\n\nSt Elijah's Monastery was believed to have been constructed by Assyrian monks in the late 6th Century and was later claimed by a Chaldean Catholic order. In 1743, its monks were given an ultimatum by Persian forces to convert to Islam. They refused, and as many as 150 were massacred.\n\nThe destruction of the monastery is part of IS's campaign against religious minorities in Iraq and neighboring Syria. The group has seized their property, forced them to convert to Islam, pay a special tax, or flee. IS has also demolished a number of monasteries and churches, as well as renowned pre-Islamic sites including Nimrud, Hatra, and Nineveh in Iraq and Palmyra in Syria.\n\nThe monastery attracted all the people from Mosul - Christians and Muslims. It became a spiritual place for Christians to visit and have religious ceremonies. Father Paul Thabit Habib, a Catholic priest from Mosul, stated that the monastery \"became a very important place for the history of the Church in Iraq.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, the monastery became a base for the Iraqi Republican Guard. In 2003, one of its walls was damaged by the impact of a T-72 tank turret that was hit by a missile during the US-led invasion of Iraq. The US Army used the monastery as a base itself, before a chaplain recognized its importance, and a commander ordered it to be cleared.\n\nThe destruction of St Elijah's Monastery is a significant loss for Iraq's Christian history. Due to security reasons, journalists and archaeologists cannot go to IS-controlled areas, making it difficult to verify the status of ancient sites. However, IS has not released any video on its propaganda outlets showing the demolition of this particular ancient site. More than 100 churches and monasteries have been razed to the ground in Mosul and the predominantly Christian villages surrounding it since they took control of the area in 2014.",
    " Title: Trump-Media Relationship: A Contentious but Symbiotic Bond\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON -- The relationship between President Donald Trump and the mainstream media has been characterized by a love-hate dynamic, with the President frequently criticizing the media, referring to them as the \"enemy of the American people.\" In response, the media has not shied away from counterpunching.\n\n\"We are not fake news,\" said Jeff Mason, President of the White House Correspondents' Association. \"We are not failing news organizations, and we are not the enemy of the American people.\"\n\nThe tension between the two parties was evident from the president's first press conference, a testy affair marked by verbal sparring. Trump exclaimed, \"The public does not believe you people anymore!\"\n\nA Media Research Center study indicates that 89% of the Trump coverage by major media networks is negative. Corey Lewandowski, former Trump campaign manager, believes this treatment is deliberate.\n\n\"They want to highlight what they perceive to be failures,\" Lewandowski said. \"This is exactly what they did during the campaign. They said the president would never run, that he would never be successful, the campaign was in shambles.\"\n\nLewandowski added, \"But it was not. It was not sophisticated enough. But the American people stepped up and said, 'we want Donald Trump' and voted for him.\"\n\nLewandowski stated that all the president wants is a fair portrayal and the whole story to be told. \"When he does a long interview with a major publication like The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal, all he asks for is don't edit it. Just print it verbatim, and if you do that, he believes that to be a fair interview,\" he told the news outlet.\n\nThe mainstream media has pushed back against this portrayal. Paul Farhi, media reporter for The Washington Post, stated, \"I think Trump makes a very big show of disliking us, disrespecting us, and disparaging us, but I think in fact, secretly, or maybe not so secretly, really likes us.\"\n\nFarhi continued, \"He loves the attention, has used that attention for his own advancement, and has really courted the media in a lot of ways.\"\n\nTrump courts the media, sending handwritten notes of praise or criticism. Farhi asserts that Trump is a media-savvy individual who knows how to leverage the media to disseminate his message.\n\n\"Trump is a very sophisticated media animal,\" Farhi said. \"He has worked with the New York media, which is the most intense for decades. He knows his way around and he knows how to utilize the media to get his message out.\"\n\nThe question now is whether this daily soap opera drama will continue for the next four years. Jake Sherman with Politico stated there is no reason to believe anything will change.\n\n\"Donald Trump is 70 years old,\" he noted. \"He's not going to change, so if we're looking for some sort of major course correction or a major shift in dynamic, we're not going to get that. He is who he is, and you're not going to change that at this point in the game.\"\n\nOne potential development could be Trump's efforts to change the country's libel and slander laws to make it easier to sue reporters and media outlets over their stories. This could mark the next level in an escalating conflict with no clear end in sight.",
    " Title: Congressional Democrats Criticize Obama Administration Over NSA Surveillance Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Democrats have criticized the Obama administration following revelations that the National Security Agency (NSA) broke privacy rules and overstepped its authority thousands of times since 2008. The details were reported late Thursday in The Washington Post, based on an audit and other secret documents provided by NSA leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the latest reports \"extremely disturbing.\" Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said, \"Reports that the NSA repeatedly overstepped its legal boundaries, broke privacy regulations, and attempted to shield required disclosure of violations are outrageous, inappropriate, and must be addressed.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he planned to hold another hearing in the wake of the report. \"The American people rely on the intelligence community to provide forthright and complete information so that Congress and the courts can properly conduct oversight,\" Leahy said in a statement. \"I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly stated that Congress was thoroughly briefed on the programs revealed by Snowden in June. The two programs, which vacuum up vast amounts of metadata and global Internet usage data, have been a source of controversy and concern for many Americans.\n\nProposed legislation to dismantle the programs was narrowly defeated last month in the House, and at least 19 other pending bills are aimed at restraining NSA's powers or changing how the agency is regulated, according to a count kept by the ACLU.\n\nObama sought to soothe concerns by promising to consider reforms to NSA surveillance a week ago. \"It's not enough for me to have confidence in these programs,\" he said at a White House news conference. \"The American people have to have confidence in them as well.\"\n\nThe most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders. Most of the infractions revealed late Thursday involve unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the United States, both of which are restricted by law and executive order, according to the May 3, 2012 audit, and other top-secret documents.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, backed up the administration on its claims, releasing a lengthy statement on Friday afternoon claiming that most the compliance problems at the NSA happen when the agency inadvertently collects records on a non-American who enters the U.S., a point when the NSA is supposed to follow different procedures.\n\nThe White House issued a statement saying, \"the majority of the compliance incidents are unintentional.\" The statement also directed questions to the National Security Council, and NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden directed questions to the NSA. NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the number of incidents in the first quarter of 2012 was higher than normal, and that the number has ranged from 372 to 1,162 in the past three years.",
    " Title: Obama Urges Congress to Revive Economic Stimulus Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has called on Congress to reconsider a set of legislative proposals aimed at stimulating the economy, which were initially proposed in September. The initiatives include investments in infrastructure, tax breaks for small businesses, and funding for teachers, firefighters, and other public sector workers.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Obama cited economic headwinds from Europe as a reason for the renewed push. The European debt crisis and the resulting economic malaise are adding to concerns that American exports may slow.\n\nCongressional Republicans declined to pass the measures last year, and until recently, the Obama administration had joined them in moving on to other debates. However, a series of unfavorable economic reports, particularly on the labor market, have sparked concern that the economy is starting to slow, and further fiscal stimulus may be needed to maintain growth rates.\n\nThe current Congress, known more for its partisanship than its legislative abilities, is unlikely to heed Obama's call. Lawmakers will recess in July and already face deadlines on student loan and highway funding bills. They will return from recess to face the so-called fiscal cliff.\n\nThe \"cliff\" includes the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, middle-class protection from the Alternative Minimum Tax, and more than 50 \"temporary\" tax breaks for individuals and businesses that are set to run out. It also includes nearly $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts across many areas of the federal budget. These would take a significant bite out of defense and non-defense spending.\n\nA number of stimulus measures, such as the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits, will also be ending. Congress must act before the end of the year.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking to members of Congress on Thursday, said the body should move quickly to resolve the issue. Bernanke stated that going over the cliff would \"pose a significant threat to the recovery.\" He added that uncertainty over the issue's resolution, largely in Congress's hands, could \"undermine business and household confidence.\"\n\nDespite the pleas from Bernanke and Obama, lawmakers are unlikely to move quickly on legislation that would provide further stimulus or certainty to markets. Republicans find the prospect of further spending to be anathema, and election year politics is unlikely to allow for compromise. Every House seat, one-third of the Senate, and the presidency are up for grabs in November.\n\nObama, perhaps acknowledging that his plea for action will fall on deaf ears, suggested that Congress will be held accountable. \"If Congress decides despite all that that they are not going to do anything about this simply because it's an election year, then they should explain to the American people why,\" he said.",
    " Title: Tectonic Shift in U.S. Gun Policy: A Year After Parkland Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nOne year after the tragic shooting in Parkland, Florida, a significant shift in U.S. gun policy has occurred, marked by the implementation of \"red flag\" laws in nine states, bringing the total to 14. These laws allow for the temporary seizure of weapons under various circumstances, such as domestic battery or social media threats. According to Adam Winkler, author of \"Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,\" this shift has resulted in approximately 140 million Americans living in states leaning towards more gun control, compared to about 112 million previously.\n\nRobert Spitzer, author of \"The Politics of Gun Control,\" notes that the rhetoric of the gun rights movement, which had previously co-opted the language of civil rights, has become less effective due to the increased number of mass shootings and the implementation of gun control measures. He states, \"We don't have tens of thousands of people being rousted in the middle of the night by the police [to take their guns]... That rhetoric gets dulling and not very effective after a while.\"\n\nPresident Trump has appointed two justices known for their pro-gun rights views, and a gun rights case originating from New York City is set to be heard this spring. However, the powerful appeals from Florida shooting survivors, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, a mass shooting survivor herself, have led to what Giffords calls a \"tectonic shift\" in U.S. gun policy. This shift comes as the National Rifle Association (NRA) has faced challenges with financing and has become embroiled in the investigation of Russian meddling in U.S. political affairs.\n\nThese charts illustrate the impact of the youth movement sparked by the Parkland shooting on political thinking and the balance between the Second Amendment and public safety in the U.S.",
    " Title: Republican Party Shifts Stance on Immigration: A Look at the New Statement of Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2012, the Republican Party's stance on immigration, as exemplified by Mitt Romney's opposition to the Dream Act, garnered 27% of the Latino vote, leading to a reevaluation of their policies on issues significant to Hispanics. The new statement of \"principles on immigration\" issued by congressional Republicans, however, does not reflect the same sentiment.\n\nThe statement, released recently, acknowledges the plight of individuals brought to the U.S. illegally as children and advocates for a path to legal residence and eventual citizenship for those who meet certain requirements, such as paying back taxes, passing background checks, and learning English.\n\nThe 2012 party platform had been critical of any form of amnesty and had promised steps to encourage \"self-deportation.\" However, the new statement accepts that these individuals could live legally and without fear in the U.S. under specific conditions.\n\nOn the issue of citizenship, the Republicans' stance differs from President Barack Obama's, who aims to create a new avenue for the undocumented to be naturalized. Yet, the Republicans do not rule out eventual citizenship and address the most pressing concerns of the undocumented: ending their fear of deportation and allowing them to work legally.\n\nThe statement's call for securing the borders and implementing E-Verify, a system that would require the federal government to confirm the employment eligibility of every new hire in America, has drawn criticism. Economist John Cochrane of the University of Chicago and the Hoover Institution has argued that such a system could potentially silence opponents by controlling their ability to earn a living.\n\nThe congressional Republicans' new stance on immigration represents a significant shift, offering legal status to millions of people but not assuring them eventual citizenship. This compromise, while authentic, perpetuates the fantasy of eradicating illegal immigration by empowering government. However, it marks progress towards reality, and time may reveal if the Republicans will fully embrace this new approach.",
    " Title: European Union Imposes Tough Economic Sanctions on Russia, Citing Ukraine Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nThe European Union (EU) has adopted a series of tough economic sanctions against Russia in response to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. The measures, coordinated with the United States, include an arms embargo and a ban on the sale of dual-use and sensitive technologies, such as advanced energy technology equipment relevant for deep sea and Arctic drilling.\n\nUnder the financial sanctions, Russian state-owned banks will be prohibited from selling bonds or equities with a maturity of over 90 days in European capital markets. Additionally, eight individuals close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and three entities have been added to the list of people and companies subject to EU-wide asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe new sanctions come as Ukrainian forces reportedly make rapid gains near the site where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed on July 17. According to reports, Ukrainian forces are attempting to split the territory held by pro-Russian rebels into two parts between the major cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, and to cut off supply lines from Russia to the rebels.\n\nIgor Girkin, a Russian citizen who is the top defense official in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, stated on Monday that more than 100 wounded separatist fighters had been evacuated to Russia. Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed Prime Minister of the separatist republic, Alexander Borodai, left the rebel-held territory for Moscow on Monday, sparking speculation that the rebels may be fleeing the city.\n\nThe EU measures were decided at a meeting of ambassadors from the bloc's 28 member countries. The new sanctions will take immediate effect and will be codified in legal language and published on Thursday. The new names to be added to the travel ban and assets freeze list should be known on Wednesday.\n\nThe Western nations are demanding Russia halt the alleged supply of arms to Ukrainian separatists and other actions that destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine. The EU official stated that the approach will be under constant review and can be adjusted in light of new developments. Normally, sanctions are in place for one year.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande stated that Western leaders \"regretted\" that Russia has not effectively pressured separatists to negotiate nor taken expected concrete measures to assure control of the Russian-Ukrainian border. Neither set of penalties is expected to fully cut off Russian economic sectors from the West, an option U.S. officials have said they are holding in reserve in case Russia launches a full-on military incursion in Ukraine or takes a similarly provocative step.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that any sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European countries on Russia would not be effective. \"We will overcome any difficulties that may arise in certain areas of the economy, and maybe we will become more independent and more confident in our own strength,\" he said, according to Reuters.",

    " Title: Senate's Attempt to Repeal and Replace Obamacare Fails, Leaving Future of Affordable Care Act Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate's effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has failed, leaving the future of the healthcare law uncertain. Here's what the death of the \"repeal and replace\" bill could mean for you.\n\nWhile Republicans have argued that Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight, independent analyses suggest a different conclusion. The focus of the debate primarily concerns the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act for people who don't get coverage through an employer or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid. Approximately 7% of the country buys coverage on the individual market.\n\nIf the law is not changed, the marketplaces will be largely stable in most parts of the country, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Participating insurers are on track to have their best year in the marketplaces since they began in 2014, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nHowever, some major players, such as Anthem, plan to no longer offer coverage in many places next year due to uncertainty about federal policy. Yet, Centene, another insurer, is expanding its coverage areas. Centene CEO Michael Neidorff said Tuesday the company's marketplace business \"continues to be particularly strong.\"\n\nStill, those buying coverage on the exchanges are likely to have fewer options next year. There are more than 24,000 people currently buying insurance on the exchanges who live in counties which might not have a participating insurance provider, according to preliminary insurance filings. Final decisions won't be made until fall.\n\n\"The individual insurance market has been stabilizing, but it needs continued support and can be undermined,\" tweeted Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, on Friday. \"Congress could play a big role in shoring them up and improving affordability.\"\n\nPremiums continue to be out of reach for some people, particularly those who don't qualify for federal subsidies. And the cheapest plans come with high deductibles that can also make it difficult to access coverage.\n\nThe pool of people using the exchanges has been sicker and older than anticipated, leading to higher premiums and fewer insurance companies willing to participate. One reason there aren't more younger, healthier people buying insurance on the exchange is due to one of the ACA's most popular provisions: the requirement that insurers let young adults stay on their parents' plans until age 26. The Obama administration also allowed people to keep their pre-ACA plans longer than originally anticipated, which kept some healthier people from moving to the marketplace. Insurers complain that the ACA's penalties for not having coverage are too lenient, and that it's too easy for people to enroll only when they anticipate needing care.\n\nDo Republicans share some of the blame for existing problems? In 2014, Congressional Republicans limited the funding in one part of the ACA that helped offset extreme losses by insurers as the marketplaces were being started. Republicans also took the Obama administration to court to block payments to insurance companies for subsidies that reduce deductibles and co-payments for lower-income customers.\n\nThe administration has kept insurance companies guessing about whether it will continue to reimburse them for the cost-sharing subsidies. The administration has also eased enforcement of the requirement that most people have insurance. Those acts are the main drivers of the premium increases sought by insurers for next year, according to the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. The uncertain future of the cost-sharing subsidies is the main factor Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish cited Wednesday when telling investors the company may pull out of more state exchanges unless Washington takes steps to stabilize the market.\n\nIf Democrats and Republicans want to improve the marketplaces, what could they do? Besides ending the dispute over the cost-sharing subsidies, lawmakers could also continue one of the other industry supports which was only supposed to be temporary. That program essentially subsidizes the cost of the sickest customers, which would reduce premiums. Experts have proposed many other changes, including expanding premium subsidies, giving insurers incentives to sell plans in counties that would otherwise lack coverage, and making families eligible for premium subsidies if plans offered by an employer aren't affordable. Some of those changes would be easier to pass than others, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned Friday morning that Republicans will not pass a \"bailout\" for insurance companies.\n\nMost of the gains in insurance coverage since the ACA was passed have come through the law's expansion of Medicaid eligibility, even though 19 states have chosen not to expand the program. But more states are expected to do so. If the law isn't changed, 80% of the population could live in states that expanded Medicaid by 2026, CBO has estimated.\n\nStates that haven't expanded may be more likely to if they can get permission from the Trump administration to not follow some Medicaid rules. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has told governors he's eager to approve alternative Medicaid models. But advocates for the poor could challenge any actions like work requirements that they think go beyond what's allowed without changing the law.",
    " Title: Democratic Victories in Virginia and New Jersey Signal Potential Republican Losses in Suburban Areas Ahead of 2018 Congressional Races\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey indicate a potential loss for the Republican party in suburban areas, as President Donald Trump's unpopularity could negatively impact the party in next year's congressional races.\n\nThe results from Tuesday, particularly in Virginia, suggest that Trump's strategy of catering to a loyal but limited base has not enabled him to broaden support for his presidency or his party. Democrats were elated, believing that control of the U.S. House of Representatives, currently controlled by Republicans, and perhaps even the Senate, might be up for grabs in next year's elections.\n\nSome Republicans shared this view after their party's candidates did poorly among independent, college-educated, women, and minority voters in suburban areas. \"Unless we get our act together, we are going to lose heavily,\" said Republican Senator John McCain on Wednesday. Democrats would need to pick up 24 seats next year to retake control of the House. Should that happen, Trump's policy agenda would be effectively dead, and the administration would come under greater scrutiny.\n\nThe win by Democrat Phil Murphy in New Jersey's governor's race came as no surprise due to the unpopularity of outgoing Republican Governor Chris Christie. However, Ralph Northam's 9-point victory over Republican Ed Gillespie for governor in swing-state Virginia was larger than expected.\n\nTrump quickly tried to distance himself from Gillespie's poor showing, stating on Twitter that the Republican candidate \"worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.\" Still, Trump's leadership record appeared to motivate Democrats to vote in record numbers in Virginia, with exit polls showing that many came out simply to express their displeasure with the president.\n\n\"Trump is turning off more voters than he's bringing in,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist in Washington. \"His base is strong, but it isn't growing.\" During his first year in office, Trump has consistently played to a base of passionate supporters, many of them older white men who live in rural areas declining in population, and has shown little inclination to reach out to the majority of voters who disapprove of him.\n\nWhit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Virginia, said the party was on a risky track. \"Republicans have traded fast-growing upscale suburban counties for slow-growing or declining rural areas. That is not a formula for long-term success.\"\n\nThere may also be signs of slippage in Trump's political base. In Virginia, Gillespie campaigned hard on immigration and crime - two hot issues with the president's supporters - but did worse than expected in some rural and suburban areas that Trump easily won last year. In rural Dickenson County, considered to be the heart of Trump country in Virginia, Gillespie's margin over Northam was almost 7 percentage points less than Trump's margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.\n\nTrump won the city of Virginia Beach in 2016 by 3 points, but Gillespie lost to Northam there by 5, a swing of eight points. More critically, Gillespie was blown out by Northam in northern Virginia's populous suburbs, where Trump also struggled in the presidential race. \"The suburbs came out in full force,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist. \"They appear to be very motivated to try and deliver a message to Trump.\"\n\nIn growing Loudoun County, outside of Washington, Democrat Barack Obama barely edged out Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. On Tuesday, Northam buried Gillespie there by almost 20 points. \"I'm worried,\" said Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman for Republican President George W. Bush, to Fox News on Wednesday. \"Democrats came out in huge numbers yesterday in the races, and if they have that kind of enthusiasm going into 2018, it's going to be very tough sailing for Republicans.\"\n\nGillespie, a longtime Washington insider and lobbyist, tried to keep his distance from Trump personally even as he adopted some of his more combative campaign rhetoric. It was a strategy that failed, and Mackowiak said the result reflected Trump's historically low approval rating. \"I don't think the White House was worried about that before, but now I think they have to be.\"\n\nThe five-day Ipsos tracking poll has Trump hovering around 35% approval nationally, with close to 60% of respondents disapproving of his performance in office. A person familiar with Trump's political operation dismissed the election results on Tuesday as having anything to do with the president, noting that both New Jersey and Virginia were won by Clinton in 2016. Andrew Surabian, an adviser to the pro-Trump political group Great America Alliance, said Gillespie lost because he was exactly the kind of establishment Republican that Trump voters have rejected. \"Ed Gillespie's campaign went down in flames because he failed to fully embrace the president or his agenda,\" Surabian said, \"and without a coherent message and an authentic messenger, Republican candidates will not be successful moving forward.\"",
    " Title: Michigan's Plan to Send Vote-by-Mail Applications to All Registered Voters: Legal Implications and Funding Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized Michigan's plan to send absentee ballot applications to all of its 7.7 million registered voters, claiming it is illegal and without authorization. The Trump campaign has a legal case against the state sending unsolicited vote-by-mail applications to voters, as the key issue lies in the term \"unsolicited.\"\n\nThe New York Times, in its own fact-check, notes that a Trump campaign official cited a 2008 Michigan case in which a judge stated that local clerks could not send absentee ballot applications to a limited universe of voters. However, the Times adds that this was before a 2018 ballot initiative that amended the state's constitution to allow absentee voting for any reason.\n\nThe 2018 amendment, known as Proposition 3, does not explicitly authorize state authorities to send unsolicited applications. It allows voters to apply to vote by mail for any reason and grants state election authorities the authority to make absent voter ballots available for voting in person at additional times and places. However, it does not authorize state authorities to make voting by mail more available than required or to send unsolicited applications.\n\nIn the 2008 case, Fleming v. Macomb, the Michigan Court of Appeals held unanimously that while private entities, including political parties, may send unsolicited absentee ballot applications to their members, the state itself cannot. The court referred to Michigan's election statute, which, even after the 2018 amendment, does not provide the express authority for state or local officials to mail ballot applications to voters who have not requested them first.\n\nThe Times' fact-check claims that the 2008 case is no longer applicable because it involved sending applications to a limited universe of voters. While that was one of the issues in the lawsuit, it was not the basis for the court's decision. The fact that voters can already print ballot applications at home also suggests that the state did not contemplate a need to authorize officials to mail unsolicited applications.\n\nTherefore, President Trump's claim that Michigan's effort \"was done illegally and without authorization\" has a solid legal ground, well-rooted in precedent and the text of the Michigan election statute. As for funding, it is possible that Trump could withhold other, future funding to the state, though that could prove more politically damaging than the risk of voter fraud itself.",
    " Title: Criticism Mounts Over Obama Administration's Deportation Policy Results\n\nArticle:\n\nImmigrant advocacy groups have criticized the Obama administration's recent findings that a policy designed to reduce the deportations of otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants has had minimal effect. The government's ongoing review found that fewer than 2 percent of the more than 400,000 pending deportation cases have been halted.\n\nThe Obama administration announced a shift in focus to the deportation of convicted criminals, people who pose a clear risk to national security, and others who defraud the visa system last year. The administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from all sides. Republicans argue that the administration is trying to circumvent immigration laws to grant amnesty and blocked the Senate's passage of the DREAM Act bill in 2010.\n\nImmigrant advocates and Latino leaders have criticized Obama for increasing the pace of deportations beyond that of the Bush administration. The Obama administration's tougher enforcement has led to the deportation of a record 1.1 million people in the last three years. The deportations have compounded Latinos' frustrations over Obama's failure to fulfill his 2008 campaign promise of pushing an immigration overhaul through Congress, as well as the failed DREAM Act.\n\nCritics argue that the stepped-up enforcement continues to target people who are supposed to be protected under the new policy. They say ICE is not effectively applying its newfound discretion, in part by declining to offer the full range of options called for in the new policy even though people in a majority of cases meet the standards.\n\nCrystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said on the call that most people are being offered administrative closure without the option to obtain work: \"It's putting your file on a shelf. That's it. No other possibilities are being offered, like the settlement of cases, adjustment of status.\"\n\nAs a result, critics say, the new policy likely will clear no more than 5 percent of the cases. ICE Director John Morton told NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday that the targeting of serious criminal offenders is driving the deportation numbers. He said roughly 216,000 criminals were removed last year.",

Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, tweeted, \"We know that the President has engaged in a long pattern of obstruction.\" He continued, \"Directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime.

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, also vowed to \"do what\u2019s necessary to find out if it\u2019s true.\" He tweeted, \"The allegation that the President of the United States may have suborned perjury before our committee in an effort to curtail the investigation and cover up his business dealings with Russia is among the most serious to date.\"\n\nThe report, published by BuzzFeed News, claims Trump directed Cohen to mislead Congress about when negotiations to launch a condo project in Russia's capital ended, as well as the extent of Trump's involvement in the deal. It later fell apart.\n\nTrump did not comment directly on the claim, but retweeted a Fox News story that mentioned Cohen has been convicted of perjury and fraud, and is reportedly under investigation over other matters.\n\n\"Lying to reduce his jail time!\" Trump tweeted. \"Watch father-in-law!\"\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani called Cohen \"a convicted criminal and a liar,\" according to a statement. \"Any suggestion \u2013 from any source \u2013 that the President counseled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false.\"\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, BuzzFeed, which cited two unnamed law enforcement officials for its report, has not independently confirmed the report.\n\nThe report further claimed that the office of special counsel Robert Mueller investigating Trump's Russia ties has additional evidence about the alleged deception backed up by \"interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.\"\n\nCohen previously testified he falsely told Congress that Trump\u2019s attempt to get the Moscow project off the ground concluded in January 2016 when he actually continued to pursue the project through June 2016. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress on this matter.\n\nHe is now cooperating with Mueller's probe and agreed to appear before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 7 before he begins a three-year prison term in March for crimes that include arranging for payments during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to silence women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump.\n\nBuzzFeed's story, if true, is significant because Trump consistently denied on the campaign trail having had any financial links to Russia. In fact, since 2016, Trump has publicly repeated more than two dozen times that he has \"nothing to do with Russia.\"\n\n\"There was no talking to Russia. There was no phone calls. I didn\u2019t make phone calls to Russia. I didn\u2019t receive phone calls. I didn\u2019t have meetings. I didn\u2019t have texts.

Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nLanny Davis, Cohen\u2019s legal and communications adviser, issued the following statement after the BuzzFeed report.\n\n\"Out of respect for Mr. Mueller\u2019s and the Office of Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, Mr. Cohen declined to respond to the questions asked by the reporters and so do I,\" Davis told the media outlet.\n\nGiuliani shot down the report Thursday night, saying in a statement, according to a tweet from Washington Post reporter Philip Rucker: \"If you believe Cohen, I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge.\"",

    " Title: Speaker Paul Ryan Announces Planned Vote for Trump in November, Offers Policy Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) has announced his intention to vote for the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, in November. In an op-ed published in his Wisconsin hometown's Walworth County Gazette Xtra, Ryan emphasized the importance of the election as a choice between two visions for America, rather than a personal endorsement of Trump.\n\nRyan's statement, delivered during Congress's Memorial Day recess, lacked the theatrical flair typically associated with Trump's campaign. In the op-ed, Ryan wrote, \"Donald Trump can help us make it a reality.\"\n\nRyan has reportedly grown weary of questions about Trump and has attempted to shift the focus of discussions to issues such as the opioid crisis. In an interview with the Associated Press, he expressed hope that the constant clarification about his stance on Trump is now over.\n\nRyan has previously criticized Trump's policy ideas and tone, notably his proposal for a Muslim ban. However, he told the AP, \"My hope is that I won't have to speak out in the future on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nTrump, in response, told The New York Times that he was \"pleased\" with Ryan's endorsement and described their relationship as good. He also acknowledged that Ryan's endorsement was delayed due to Trump's initial position as a presumptive nominee, which was expected to go to the convention.\n\nRyan's op-ed primarily addressed the Republican Party's policy agenda, rather than directly endorsing Trump. He answered a question about the party's policy priorities if a Republican president were in office, discussing topics such as tax code, executive overreach, party unity, and eventually, his reluctant assertion that he would vote for Trump in the November election.\n\nReuters reported that Ryan did not use the word \"endorse\" in his op-ed, and an aide later clarified on Twitter that Ryan's move should be seen as an endorsement. Ryan's criticisms of Trump's policy ideas and tone have been well-documented, but his nod to the Trump campaign represents a declaration that the Republican Party will continue, and the speaker of the House would like to move forward as well, as he told the AP.",
    " Title: Defense Policy Chief John Rood Resigns Amid Impeachment Inquiry Ties\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Rood, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, will step down from his position at the end of this month, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday, confirming earlier reporting. Rood, who joined the administration in 2018, was involved in approving $250 million in security assistance for Ukraine, aid that was temporarily withheld by the White House last summer.\n\nThe Pentagon's statement follows reports that Rood was asked to resign after losing the support of top national-security leadership. Administration officials told Bloomberg that senior national-security officials had lost confidence in Rood's ability to execute President Donald Trump's agenda. Sources told Foreign Policy that he was asked to resign after Trump lost confidence in him following a string of departures of senior Pentagon policymakers.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday morning following reports of Rood's resignation, the president wished Rood well and thanked him for his service. Rood's resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC, reveals that Trump requested his resignation. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper thanked Rood in a separate statement.\n\nWhile the specific reason for Rood's resignation is still unclear, multiple reports have noted his connection to the security aid to Ukraine that became the focus of impeachment proceedings. In his role at the Pentagon, which involved building partnerships and encouraging defense cooperation with US allies and partners, Rood certified to Congress that Ukraine was eligible to receive $250 million in security assistance. That aid was temporarily withheld at the White House's direction last summer.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that it withheld the aid because of concerns about corruption, but Trump was accused of using the aid to pressure Ukraine to advance his political aims. In May, before the president decided to withhold the aid, Rood said in a letter to lawmakers that he \"certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.\"\n\nThe letter, which was leaked in September, undermined the administration's argument. Rood expressed concern about withholding aid to Ukraine in an email to Esper following Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that set in motion Trump's impeachment. In the email, Rood wrote that \"placing a hold on security assistance at this time would jeopardize this unique window of opportunity and undermine our defense priorities with a key partner in the strategic competition with Russia.\"\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting Russian-backed separatists in the country's eastern region. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and acquitted by the Senate earlier this month. Since his impeachment, Trump has taken steps to remove some officials from their posts.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio Gains Momentum in New Hampshire After Strong Iowa Finish\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Iowa caucuses, Florida Senator Marco Rubio's campaign has gained momentum in New Hampshire. On the night following the caucuses, Rubio addressed an enthusiastic crowd of over 700 supporters at Exeter's town hall. The candidate delivered his familiar stump speech, which resonated with the audience following his surprising third-place finish in Iowa.\n\nRubio emphasized his family's immigrant, working-class roots, stating that his parents would drive him through affluent Las Vegas suburbs and remind him that, despite his father being a bartender and his mother a maid, they could achieve financial success and own a house in the one country where such success was possible.\n\nRubio is positioning himself as a candidate uniquely qualified to unite Republican voters and reach out to lower-income and minority communities that have historically delivered Democratic votes. He stated, \"If I'm our nominee, we will win, and the Democrats know this.\" He further added, \"They do not want to run against me. There is a reason why the Democrats, and in particular Hillary Clinton, attack me five times for every time they want to attack someone else. They know that if I'm our nominee, they lose.\"\n\nRepublicans have drawn comparisons between Rubio and former President Barack Obama, as both candidates have centered their pitch around a powerful personal narrative that taps into the American dream and the appeal of a telegenic first-term lawmaker and his young family. However, this comparison has also been a point of criticism, with other Republicans arguing that Rubio is too inexperienced.\n\nCritiques have been particularly pointed from the three governors Rubio is trying to outpace in the \"establishment lane\" \u2013 John Kasich, Jeb Bush, and Chris Christie. Bush compared Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz to \"back-benchers who have never done anything of consequence in their lives.\" Christie has begun referring to Rubio as \"the boy in the bubble,\" mocking both Rubio's youth and his repetitive speeches.\n\nIn response to Christie's critique, Rubio's campaign held several brief press availabilities during Wednesday's town hall swing. The four-way tussle among Rubio, Kasich, Christie, and Bush is intense, as the stakes are high. Republican power-brokers are concerned about the possibility of a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz nomination.\n\nAll four campaigns are banking on elected officials and high-powered donors to rally around the winning campaign in New Hampshire. A repeat strong showing from Rubio would likely secure him as the establishment's preferred candidate. Rubio is aware of the anti-Washington and anti-establishment sentiment this year and is quick to point out the irony. He stated, \"I can tell you that when it comes to the establishment, which is, people who have been involved in politics for a long time, they did not want me to run for president, and they did not want me to run for Senate five years ago.\" However, in a Trump- and Cruz-dominated primary, party power-brokers are desperate for someone to rally around. If Rubio performs well for a second week in a row, he is likely to be that candidate.",
    " Title: Investment-Based Student Loans Offer Alternative to Traditional Loans\n\nArticle:\n\nA new approach to student loans, known as Income Share Agreements (ISAs), is gaining traction as a potential solution to the rising student debt crisis. Unlike traditional loans, ISAs involve investors providing funds to colleges, which in turn offer free or partially free education to students. The students then pay the college a certain percentage of their future income upon graduation.\n\nBeth Akers, co-author of the book \"Game of Loans,\" explains that ISAs allow colleges to ensure students only pay if they are successful. Andrew Hoyler, a professional pilot who received an ISA from Purdue University, will pay the university 8% of his income for 104 months. Hoyler states that after the 104-month term ends, if he still owes money, it will be forgiven.\n\nThe terms for ISAs vary based on the student's major. For a $10,000 ISA, English majors must pay 4.58% of their income for 116 months, while math majors, who are more likely to secure higher-paying jobs, pay just 3.96% for 96 months. Akers notes that ISAs provide students with information about the potential earnings of different majors.\n\nCritics argue that ISAs may discourage students from pursuing less profitable majors, but proponents argue that this is simply a way for investors to recoup the money they've invested. Hoyler agrees, stating that the security of knowing he'll never pay back more than he can afford is worth the potential higher payments for some students.\n\nSome politicians have expressed support for government-backed student loans, arguing that they save taxpayers money. However, the Brookings Institution found that 28% of students do not even know they have a loan. Critics argue that the market would make better judgments and prevent students from starting their adult lives under a burden they may never escape.\n\nISAs have been criticized as predatory, but Hoyler points out that if a student does not have a job, they do not pay anything. Paul Larora, another Purdue ISA recipient, states, \"We don't know who the investor is, but I'd love to give him a hug or buy him a beer!\"\n\nAkers explains that colleges act as middlemen, ensuring that no one takes advantage of students. She argues that forcing banks out of the loan business and relying on government-backed loans is not the solution. Instead, she suggests allowing actual private lenders, who have skin in the game, to make loans and assess loan risk. This would encourage lenders to tell students which majors might lead to higher-paying careers and warn them about the potential difficulties of certain majors.\n\nIn conclusion, ISAs offer a potential alternative to traditional student loans, with investors taking on the risk of student loan defaults and students only paying if they are successful. While ISAs have been criticized as predatory, proponents argue that they provide students with valuable information about the potential earnings of different majors and offer a more flexible repayment structure.",
    " Title: Dual Responses: Rand Paul and Marco Rubio Deliver Tea Party and Official GOP Responses to State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday, two Republican responses were delivered, one by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and the other by Florida Senator Marco Rubio. While Rubio delivered the official Republican response, Paul delivered a response sponsored by the Tea Party Express.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the national Tea Party Patriots, stated that both Paul and Rubio are elected officials who are fighting for tea party values of fiscal responsibility and constitutionally limited government. However, the Republican Party's choice of Rubio, a son of Cuban immigrants, to deliver the official response has marked him as the establishment's chosen spokesman, and as such, acceptable as a potential 2016 presidential nominee if he decides to run.\n\nRubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, stated that having high-profile responses from both Rubio and Paul is beneficial for the Republican Party. \"We're glad Sen. Paul is doing his speech tonight. As far as we're concerned, the more Republicans that are responding to the president, the better,\" Conant said.\n\nPaul unofficially launched his 2016 nomination bid with a visit to Israel last month in the company of some 40 American evangelicals and several prominent Jewish Americans. For those closely monitoring his actions, it was no surprise that he elected to give what he calls his own \"tea party\" response to the president, or that he doesn't explicitly deny that his move is an intentional clash with Rubio.\n\nPaul, however, doesn't view his speech as competing with Rubio but rather \"as an extra response.\" Yet, Paul doesn't explicitly say his speech isn't intended to draw contrasts with Rubio on a variety of hot issues, from immigration to foreign aid.\n\nPaul taped his response on Tuesday afternoon at the National Press Club in downtown Washington, and it will air on all major news cable networks and affiliates except Fox. The feed will be streamed on www.teapartyexpress.org and <https://www.redstate.com/>.\n\nSome in the press and in GOP official circles are calling Rubio the new face of the GOP. However, Paul has rejected this idea, stating, \"I don't think anybody gets to choose who is the face is or say you or someone else is the face. I think we do the best to promote what we believe in.\"\n\nTea Party Patriots' other co-founder, Marc Meckler, now president of Citizens for Self-governance, argued that \"it's hard to legitimately call Rubio 'establishment' when he beat down the establishment to take out Charlie Christ.\" Rubio's voting record in the Senate and the stands he has taken there generally comport with tea party values, according to Meckler.\n\nHowever, Meckler then recounted his observations of what may be a growing rift between Rubio and the tea party, with some tea party groups expressing skepticism and a lack of accessibility from Rubio. This sentiment has been attributed by some Republican operatives, such as Karl Rove, to the tea party's role in nominating conservative GOP candidates who then get trounced by Democrats in general elections.",
    " Title: Ukraine Repels Attack at Donetsk Airport, Russia Sends Aid Convoy Amidst Ceasefire Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nUkrainian military forces repelled pro-Russian separatists at Donetsk airport on Saturday, marking a resurgence of fighting in the eastern part of the country, a week after a ceasefire agreement was reached. A volley of rockets struck residential buildings near the airport, but no casualties were reported, according to a statement posted on the City Council website.\n\nTensions escalated further as Russia sent a second convoy of trucks into Ukraine without its consent. The fighting prompted Ukraine's Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, to assert that despite the truce, his country remains in a state of conflict with its powerful neighbor.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, whose country annexed most of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March, has consistently denied that Russian troops have entered eastern Ukraine. However, he defends the Russian-speaking minority's right to defend themselves.\n\nA convoy of about 245 trucks, reportedly filled with nearly 2,000 tons of humanitarian aid, crossed the Russian border and into Ukraine. The first trucks delivered shipments of cereals, sugar, medicines, and warm clothes, among other items, to the eastern Ukrainian city of Lugansk, according to a report by the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS.\n\nResidents in Lugansk reportedly found five-liter containers of drinking water particularly joyful, as they had been without water for over a month. The last of the trucks crossed back into Russia around 6:30 p.m. Moscow time \"without incidents,\" according to the report.\n\nIn August, Ukrainian officials called the first convoy of humanitarian aid from Russia an invasion of the country, and protested any attempts by Russia to unilaterally bring in the aid. Eventually, Russia allowed its trucks to cross into rebel-held territory without the oversight of the International Red Cross, contrary to an agreement signed between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nUkrainian officials' silence on the second convoy indicates a significant shift in the mood in the Kiev government, where President Petro Poroshenko has been making efforts to prove that the ceasefire deal, riddled by violations since its imposition last week, has yielded improvements on the ground in east Ukraine.\n\nHowever, in his speech on Saturday, Yatsenyuk stated that important government-proposed reforms to benefit the entire country have been stymied by the ongoing conflict. \"If we stop the war, if we contain Russia \u2014 we will get the chance to attract international investors, because it is not an easy job to attract an international investor when you have in your country already Russian tanks and Russian artillery,\" he said.",
    " Title: CBS News Reporter Faces Internal Criticism for Aggressive Pursuit of Benghazi Story\n\nArticle:\n\nCBS News correspondent Sharyl Attkisson, known for her relentless pursuit of the Fast & Furious scandal, is reportedly facing criticism from her own organization for her aggressive coverage of the Benghazi story. According to Politico, CBS News executives view Attkisson's Benghazi reporting as wading dangerously close to advocacy, with some of her stories failing to air and leaving her feeling marginalized and underutilized.\n\nAttkisson's coverage of the Benghazi story has been a point of contention within CBS News, with executives expressing frustration over her pursuit of the issue. This tension has led to discussions about Attkisson's departure from CBS, as reported in an April article by Politico.\n\nThe internal conflicts within CBS News provide important context for the current situation. Ed Morrissey, a political commentator, noted that Attkisson's Twitter feed went silent during today's hearings, leading to speculation about the reasons behind this silence.\n\nThe Benghazi story, which involves the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the death of four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, has been a contentious topic in the media. Some argue that the story is being dismissed by the mainstream media as a right-wing conspiracy, while others view it as an important issue that deserves scrutiny.\n\nAttkisson's reporting on Benghazi has made it difficult to pigeonhole the story as a right-wing obsession, as her work has been covered by CBS News, an organization that holds a platinum reputation in left-leaning media circles. This has reportedly led to questions about her integrity and marginalization within the organization.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Attkisson's coverage of the Benghazi story highlights the challenges faced by journalists who pursue stories that are not in line with the mainstream narrative or the political leanings of their organization. It also underscores the importance of maintaining journalistic integrity and objectivity in the face of internal and external pressure.",
    " Title: District of Columbia's New Gun Registration Renewal Requirement Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department in Washington D.C. has proposed new rules that will require all legal firearm owners in the city to renew their gun registration certificates in person at police headquarters. This renewal process, which starts on January 1, 2023, has sparked controversy and criticism from gun owners and legal experts.\n\nUnder the new rules, anyone with a gun registered before 2011 will have to go to police headquarters to be fingerprinted, photographed, provide proof of address, pay a fee, and confirm they may still legally possess the firearm. The Firearms Registration Section will then create a new registration certificate\u2014now in the form of an ID card\u2014for each gun.\n\nThe renewal process was initially supposed to be done online and by mail, but the police did not retain any of the fingerprints or photos taken until March 2013. The police propose scheduling everyone in three-month windows based on the individual's birthday, and they intend to set up an online system to make an appointment. However, the department is still trying to finalize a system to accept credit cards for the $13-per-gun fee.\n\nCritics argue that the renewal process is onerous, unnecessary, and a potential trap for the unwary. Stephen P. Halbrook, the lead attorney for Heller v. District of Columbia, also known as \"Heller II,\" stated that \"Re-registration is onerous and completely unnecessary and is a trap for the unwary. Fail to re-register for whatever reason, and you\u2019re committing a crime\u2014possession of an unregistered firearm. This is plain harassment for exercise of a constitutional right.\"\n\nThe registration-renewal requirement is already being challenged in court through Heller v. District of Columbia, which takes on the entire registration law that was enacted in 2009 after the Supreme Court overturned the District's 30-year-old handgun ban in the original Heller decision.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the new gun registration renewal requirement has raised questions about the effectiveness of such measures in improving public safety. Critics argue that the low number of registered firearms in the city, estimated to be approximately 30,000 for a city of 600,000, indicates that most law-abiding people do not go through the registration process. Additionally, criminals are not showing up at police headquarters to offer up their fingerprints or take a written test before buying guns.\n\nEmily Miller, senior editor of opinion for The \u2588\u2588\u2588 and author of \"Emily Gets Her Gun,\" has criticized the new requirement as a clear violation of the Founding Fathers' intent that the Second Amendment would prevent government tyranny. Once the government knows about every single gun owned by each citizen, then an armed populace is no longer a deterrent.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department has not issued a statement regarding the controversy surrounding the new gun registration renewal requirement. The deadline for citizens to comment on the regulations is December 15, 2022.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore Threatens Lawsuit Against Washington Post Over Sexual Misconduct Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nAlabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has announced his intention to sue The Washington Post over a report alleging sexual misconduct, including pursuing relationships with teenagers, when he was in his 30s. In a campaign speech in Huntsville, Alabama, on Sunday night, Moore stated, \"These attacks [on my character and reputation] are false and untrue, and for which they will be sued.\"\n\nThe Washington Post's report, published on Thursday, was based on interviews with more than 30 people. The report alleged that Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32, and three other women claimed he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18. The woman who was 14 at the time claimed Moore took her to his house, undressed her, and touched her, which could have constituted sexual offenses due to her age, but the statutes of limitations in effect during that time have passed.\n\nNone of the other three women told The Post that Moore sexually harassed, assaulted, or forced them into a relationship. Alabama's legal age of consent is 16. Moore has denied the allegations since they were published. He called the claims \"completely false\" on Friday during an appearance on Sean Hannity's syndicated radio show.\n\nSpeaking at a Veterans Day event at the Mid-Alabama Republican Club in Birmingham on Saturday, Moore called the allegations \"fake news\" and \"yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate.\" He added that the alleged incidents happened nearly 40 years ago and called them \"very hurtful to me personally -- I have the highest regard for the protection of young children.\" Moore also stated that he has never provided alcohol to a minor and has \"not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.\"\n\nMoore added that there were ongoing \"investigations\" looking into the motivations behind the Post article, and promised \"revelations\" about the story to come in the next few days, though he did not provide further specifics. A number of Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the Washington Post article, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which severed a joint fundraising agreement that benefits Moore's campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post has not commented on the matter since the story was published. This article has been updated to reflect The Post's decision to not comment.",
    " Title: NBC News Drops Balanced Approach to Climate Change Discussion on \"Meet the Press\"\n\nArticle:\n\nNBC News has decided to no longer treat climate change as a debate with two opposing sides, as stated by host Chuck Todd during Sunday's episode of \"Meet the Press.\" The program featured an hour-long panel discussion on the consequences of climate change, but Todd's opening remarks drew criticism for characterizing the nature of the climate debate inaccurately.\n\nTodd declared, \"We're not going to debate climate change, the existence of it. The earth is getting hotter, and human activity is a major cause. Period.\" He further added, \"We're not going to give time to climate deniers. The science is settled even if political opinion is not.\"\n\nSkeptics of the most alarmist climate change scenarios argue that the term \"denier\" is misleading, as it implies parallels to those who deny historical events such as the Holocaust or the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. They contend that while it is accepted that burning fossil fuels increases carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, there is a wide range of scientific opinion on matters such as the extent of human influence on gas levels, the likelihood of various consequences, the impact of other factors on the climate, and the quality and extent of historical climate data.\n\nTodd's Sunday statement was preceded by video clips of dramatic weather events from the past year, though climatologists emphasize the difference between \"weather\" and \"climate.\" Scientists are typically reluctant to attribute specific weather events to human-induced climate change.\n\nThe panel on Sunday included non-scientists offering their opinions, such as California Governor Jerry Brown, Representative Carlos Curbelo, and potential Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg. Curbelo expressed concern about the one-sided discussion, stating, \"We need to stop covering the debate and start covering the story so that people see that this is real, and so that politicians take a more pragmatic approach and find solutions that are actually achievable.\"\n\nPoliticians such as Senator Bernie Sanders praised the show, with Sanders taking to Twitter to offer \"congratulations to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for holding a serious discussion about climate change.\" Sanders questioned, \"Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV?\"",

LaPierre's email emphasized that the focus is not on protecting children or reducing crime, but rather on \"banning your guns.\"\n\nLast week, the NRA attended a White House meeting that was marketed to the public as an \"open discussion\" about improving school safety. However, LaPierre alleged that the meeting was a \"dirty lie,\" as the administration did not address gun owners' concerns or consider practical solutions for ensuring school safety.\n\nAccording to LaPierre, the administration's true intentions are to \"blame\" gun owners, \"vilify\" them, \"bully\" them, and \"strip\" them of their Second Amendment rights. The proposed legislation, he claimed, would ban certain guns, register ammunition purchases, and require gun owners to register their firearms with the government.\n\nLaPierre urged supporters to renew or upgrade their NRA membership as soon as possible, stating that the current situation is a \"fight of the century\" and that the NRA needs their support more than ever. He provided a link for online renewal or upgrade at www.NRA.org/StandAndFight.\n\nThe email also addressed the media's portrayal of gun owners and the NRA, stating that members have been called \"terrorists\" and faced personal threats. LaPierre vowed to challenge these attacks and defend the right to self-defense and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.\n\nThe email concluded with a call to action, emphasizing the need for gun owners to stand together in the face of these proposed measures. LaPierre expressed gratitude for the support of his fellow members, stating that their strength and commitment are crucial to the NRA's efforts.",
    " Title: Clinton Reaffirms Commitment to Gun Control and Criminal Justice Reform in Campaign Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign event on Saturday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reiterated her stance on gun control and criminal justice reform, two key issues that have been central to her primary campaign. The event, which was attended by some mothers who have lost children to gun violence or police clashes, comes as the Clinton campaign shifts its focus to the general election against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nClinton's remarks on gun control were made in response to comments made by Trump during a previous event, where he suggested that Clinton's policies could put women in danger, particularly in rough or bad communities. Clinton's campaign has previously highlighted the stories of mothers who have lost children to gun violence or police encounters in evocative television ads.\n\nIn her speech, Clinton reaffirmed her support for stricter gun laws and background checks for all purchases. A poll conducted by The New York Times and CBS News in January found that 57 percent of respondents wanted stricter laws governing gun sales, and 88 percent favored background checks for all purchases.\n\nIn addition to gun control, Clinton also addressed the issue of criminal justice reform. She vowed to end the \"school to prison pipeline\" that disproportionately affects black men and pledged to \"end the era of mass incarceration\" and \"rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities.\" These issues could resonate with voters in California, particularly in cities like Los Angeles and Oakland, ahead of the state's June 7 primary.\n\nClinton also spoke about the need to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system, stating, \"Something is wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn't consider their children as precious and worthy of protection as other children because of the color of their skins.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign's focus on gun control and criminal justice reform has helped her win broad support among African-Americans during the primary campaign.

This shift is particularly notable among those who have celebrated the \"rainbow wave\" of LGBTQ+ political candidates, five years after the legalization of same-sex marriage and in the midst of ongoing battles against the Trump administration's policies on transgender rights.\n\nButtigieg, an openly gay candidate, running for president alongside his husband, Chasten, is seen as a powerful symbol by many. For individuals who have faced discrimination based on their sexual orientation, this representation is significant. In the words of one voter, \"Identity matters... Buttigieg is gay. These facets of their identities mean that they can understand the powerless, as victims of power, and that they can understand the alienated, having been marginalized.\"\n\nButtigieg's campaign is also resonating with Christians whose faith is more liberal on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, racial reconciliation, and diversity. This approach is not expected to win over white evangelicals and white Catholics who align with Trumpism, but rather, it appears to be targeting a majority of Americans who believe in a more inclusive Christianity.\n\nThe religious left, including Buttigieg, Booker, and Warren, are advocating for a return to the core values of Christianity, emphasizing generosity towards the poor, welcoming to the stranger, and treating people with dignity, rather than focusing on sexuality. This shift is seen as a counterbalance to the conservative political agenda that has been promoted by some evangelical Christians in the past.\n\nIn the political arena, the focus on sexuality has led to a disproportionate emphasis on homosexuality, a concern raised by these religious leaders. They argue that this focus has resulted in a deeply regrettable fixation, and that religion should provide a critical perspective on society, not be used to justify pre-determined political positions.\n\nThe emergence of a religious left, with Buttigieg as a symbol, is a developing story in American politics. The implications of this shift remain to be seen, particularly in the context of the ongoing impeachment investigation against President Trump. While the evidence against Trump is circumstantial, it is not considered weak. Criminal investigations often rely on circumstantial evidence, and in the absence of an explicit quid pro quo proposal, the context and circumstances may become the focus of the investigation. Whether this evidence is sufficient to lead to Trump's removal from office is a matter yet to be determined.",
    " Title: Guam Residents Carry On with Daily Activities Amid North Korea Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nGuam, a U.S. territory, experienced a relatively normal Saturday at Home Depot, despite the ongoing international tension between the United States and North Korea. The island, which has been in the international spotlight due to North Korea's threats, saw a slight increase in purchases of items typically associated with disaster preparedness, such as bottled water and batteries.\n\nHowever, the majority of customers were shopping for everyday items, according to Home Depot loss prevention manager Andrew Guilliot. He noted that while there was a slight increase in purchases of items like bottled water, generators, batteries, tarps, and plastic were not seeing significant spikes.\n\nThe calm demeanor of Guam residents was also evident in other areas. The University of Guam Kids Fishing Derby saw a strong turnout of about 40 registered children, their families, and a handful of unregistered participants. Residents also went spear fishing, attended football practice, visited beaches, and crowded malls.\n\nSome residents, such as Ordot resident David Lessard, 55, were considering disaster preparedness. Lessard, who lived through the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in the Philippines in 1991, was looking into stocking up on canned goods and bottled water.\n\nHowever, the general sentiment among Guam residents seemed to be one of calm and normalcy. Dededo resident Vicente Bautista, 62, who heard similar threats in 1977 when he was an Army infantryman near the Demilitarized Zone, believed that North Korea was merely trying to show off and did not have the technology to back up its threats.\n\nGuam Chamber of Commerce issued a simple statement on Friday, stating, \"It is business as usual on Guam.\" This sentiment was echoed by many residents, with Dededo resident Mike Soderquist, 44, stating that he was just out shopping and had plans for a barbecue later in the day.\n\nDespite the ongoing tension, Guam's leaders have received assurances from President Trump and White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly. Guam Governor Eddie Calvo said in a video message that the assurances gave him great comfort. The island's leaders and residents remain hopeful that the situation will de-escalate peacefully.",
    " Title: Rand Paul's Healthcare Stance: A Study of Principle and Expediency\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a prominent figure in the Republican Party, has been vocal in his opposition to compromises on healthcare reform that do not involve full repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In an interview with Neil Cavuto of Fox News, Paul expressed his disappointment with the Republican Party's decision to vote in favor of maintaining parts of Obamacare.\n\nThe article explores the potential intersection of Paul's principles and political expediency, suggesting that his opposition to compromises may be driven by a combination of genuine convictions and strategic maneuvers to avoid accountability. The article draws parallels between Paul's stance and that of his father, Ron Paul, a longtime Texas congressman known for his opposition to many bills on constitutional and libertarian grounds.\n\nThe article highlights instances where Paul's actions seem to contradict his stated goals, such as his opposition to association-exemption provisions that were already included in the healthcare bill. The article also mentions Paul's history of opposing earmarks, a practice his father was known for, despite voting against spending bills that contained his district's pork barrel projects.\n\nThe article concludes by noting that while it is difficult to definitively determine the motivations behind Paul's actions, his actions during the healthcare reform process suggest a pattern of moving away from opportunities for progress when they appear to align with his goals. The article also mentions Paul's proposal for a clean repeal of Obamacare, a stance he has maintained despite previously warning against such an approach.\n\nThe article does not take a political stance and presents the information in a neutral and factual manner, avoiding personal opinions, subjective statements, or speculation.",
    " Title: U.S. Defense Secretary Defends Diversion of Funds for Border Wall at Munich Security Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nMUNICH, Germany (AP) \u2014 U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper defended his decision to divert billions of dollars in funding for Navy and Air Force aircraft and other military programs to help pay for President Donald Trump's promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border during a press conference on the first day of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, on Friday, Feb. 14, 2020.\n\nEsper was asked about criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas, who called the diversion of funds contrary to the constitutional authority of Congress.\n\n\"Border security is national security,\" Esper said. \"And national security is our mission.\"\n\nHe added, \"The action we took is legal under the law, and so it should be no surprise, and I'll just leave it at that for now.\"\n\nEsper spoke on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich.\n\nThe Pentagon announced on Thursday that Esper approved shifting $3.8 billion in funds that Congress had previously authorized for F-35 fighter aircraft and other military programs. The money is being diverted to help the Department of Homeland Security build portions of the border wall. The Pentagon indicated that more such actions could be coming to provide additional funding for Trump's signature campaign promise.\n\nThe action drew sharp rebukes from Democrats as well as Republicans.\n\n\"Today's reprogramming request confirms once again that the President is obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise at the expense of our national security,\" Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. \"This administration has already stolen billions from the Department of Defense in order to begin building the president's vanity wall and today they are doubling down on bad policy.\"\n\nLast year, despite congressional opposition, Trump faced no consequences when making similar transfers by cancelling or postponing dozens of military construction projects to free up $3.6 billion.\n\nIn reaction to Thursday's Pentagon announcement, Thornberry, the top Republican on the committee and a supporter of wall construction, said that while the administration's constitutional role is to recommend how tax dollars are spent, final choices are made by Congress.\n\n\"Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense can not change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,\" he said. \"Attempts to do so undermine the principle of civilian control of the military and are in violation of the separation of powers within the Constitution. The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress' constitutional authority, and I believe that it requires Congress to take action.\"\n\nTrump, while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico refused.",
    " Title: Democrats' \"Better Deal\" Agenda: A New Package of Old Ideas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, on September 22, 2017, President Trump asserted that the Republican Party's traditional policies might be sufficient for the midterm elections, but they would not be enough in the long term. This article examines the Democratic Party's response, focusing on their \"Better Deal\" agenda, which critics argue is a rehash of the New Deal policies that have defined the Democratic Party for much of the last century.\n\nThe New Deal, a series of programs, jobs projects, and reforms introduced during the Great Depression, has been a cornerstone of the Democratic Party's policy vision. The Fair Deal and the Great Society, both continuations of the New Deal, were proposed by Presidents Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson, respectively.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, wrote in the Washington Post that the attacks marked the end of the era of shrinking federal government. He argued for a \"new New Deal\" to address the new challenges the nation faced.\n\nDespite the Democrats' criticism of the Republican Party's stale ideas, they have repeatedly returned to the well of the New Deal, a policy framework that was established four years after the invention of sliced bread. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is a child of the New Deal, has been a proponent of its principles.\n\nThe Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda, unveiled in 2018, is a rehash of the New Deal, according to critics. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley, when asked for a fresh idea during a Fox News Sunday interview, responded with a new infrastructure plan, but one that would have the federal government shoulder a larger share of the costs compared to President Trump's plan.\n\nThe New Deal was never a coherent program, but rather a mixed and ad hoc response to the economic crisis of the 1930s. Raymond Moley, FDR's right-hand man during much of the New Deal, described the programs as a collection of miscellaneous items in a boy's bedroom, assembled by an interior decorator.\n\nThe Democrats' reliance on the New Deal framework may unify Democratic politicians, but it does little to address the divisions within the party's voter base. The time will come when the \"Better Deal\" will no longer be enough, and the Democrats will need to embrace new ideas and approaches to remain competitive.",
    " Title: Congress and President Trump Negotiate Budget Deal, Addressing DACA and Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress is currently in negotiations to pass a budget deal that would maintain government operations without using the status of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, often referred to as \"Dreamers,\" as bargaining chips. However, it is expected that President Trump may reconsider his threat of deportation for these individuals only if Congress considers significant cuts to legal immigration, marking the first deep reductions since the 1920s.\n\nThe proposed changes by President Trump are based on a nativist, zero-sum perspective that views immigration as detrimental to the United States. This perspective contradicts American tradition, principles, and evidence suggesting benefits for the country.\n\nThe programs under consideration for cuts are designed to promote diversity and humanity in legal immigration. One such program is the lottery system, which grants visas to individuals from countries underrepresented as sources of American immigrants. The other program is family-based immigration, which offers visas to close relatives of citizens and legal residents.\n\nPresident Trump, who has frequently portrayed immigrants as terrorists and criminals, has recently focused his fear-mongering on the diversity visa program. Last month, his Department of Homeland Security released a report alleging that those entering the country via the lottery were more likely to be tied to terrorist attacks. However, a report by the Cato Institute found that lottery visa holders were responsible for only eight of the 3,037 Americans murdered by foreign-born terrorists since 1975.\n\nImmigrants selected through the lottery do not bypass security checks or education requirements. They must have at least a high school education or two years of experience in skilled work, and they undergo criminal, national security, and medical checks. The 50,000 recipients of the visas are not guaranteed permanent residence, but rather a chance to proceed through the rest of the immigration process.",
    " Title: House Democrats Consider Boycotting Benghazi Investigative Committee; GOP Leaders Push for Bipartisan Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats are deliberating the participation in a special investigative committee on the Benghazi attacks, with some members considering a boycott of the investigation. The discussions took place behind closed doors on Wednesday, and Democratic leaders declined to disclose their future plans after the meeting.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stated, \"One day at a time,\" when asked about the committee's structure. Some rank-and-file Democrats argue that participating in the select committee would improperly legitimize what they view as a political effort, while others believe that abstaining would prevent them from influencing the investigation's direction and narrative.\n\nAccording to several sources, based on Wednesday's meeting, it appears that Democrats are leaning toward not participating. GOP leaders outlined the particulars of the select committee on Tuesday evening, setting the stage for a comprehensive probe into various aspects of the U.S. response and internal communications following the attack.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner stated, \"It's not going to be a sideshow, it is not going to be a circus.\" The committee will consist of seven Republicans and five Democrats, a move that has rankled Democrats. Pelosi and her deputy, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., objected in a letter to Boehner, calling for an even split between Democrats and Republicans and a \"real and equal voice\" in issuing subpoenas, questioning witnesses, and other areas.\n\nIn their letter, Pelosi and Hoyer expressed concern that the principles outlined in the draft resolution provided by the GOP leaders had been rejected. They called on Boehner to reconsider the approach before bringing the measure to the House floor for a vote.\n\nRepublicans argue that the select committee is essential, particularly in light of revelations that the Obama administration withheld relevant emails for months before their release as part of a lawsuit last week. The committee will have subpoena power and may order depositions to be given under oath. A final report is required, though some of it may be classified. The next step will be for the House to vote on the committee, and for members to be chosen.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., has already been selected to chair the committee. Among other priorities, the committee will seek to answer what was done in response to the Sep. 11, 2012 attack, including efforts to rescue U.S. personnel. Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the assault on the U.S. compound. The committee will have subpoena power and may order depositions to be given under oath. A final report is required, though some of it may be classified. The next step will be for the House to vote on the committee, and for members to be chosen.",
    " Title: Trump Administration to Reshape Title X Family Planning Program, Potentially Affecting Planned Parenthood\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has the opportunity to reshape the Title X family planning program, a federally funded initiative that has long been a target of conservative critics. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is setting the terms for obtaining grants under Title X, a program that provides family planning services to millions of low-income individuals.\n\nTeresa Manning, the deputy assistant secretary of the office of population affairs at HHS, which oversees Title X, is a prominent anti-abortion advocate and a former lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee. Manning, who has been critical of Title X in the past, now has the opportunity to reshape the program to align with the administration's anti-abortion views.\n\nAudrey Sandusky, communications director for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), which represents Title X grant recipients, stated, \"This is the administration's first attempt to really kind of redefine what they want the family planning program to look like.\" Sandusky added, \"We anticipate some attempt to undercut the program.\"\n\nSupporters of Title X worry the administration will freeze out clinics that also provide abortions, restrict the types of services performed at clinics, limit access to some types of birth control, or reduce funding for the program. Meanwhile, anti-abortion advocates are hoping the administration will resurrect Reagan-era regulations that banned Title X providers from offering abortion referrals and counseling and from encouraging, promoting, or advocating abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nSteve Aden, chief legal officer and general counsel at Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion advocacy group in D.C., stated, \"The best thing for health care and for women is that they receive [family planning services] in a setting that's devoid of the possibility of Planned Parenthood pushing quote unquote options, when what they're doing is referring them to the abortion facility.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's intent will be clear when HHS issues a funding opportunity announcement for the Title X grants. The conditions are expected to differ from those set by the Obama administration, perhaps significantly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Planned Parenthood and its affiliates receive about $60 million a year through the Title X program. In 2017, Congress appropriated $286 million total for the grants.\n\nKinsey Hasstedt, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, said it would be naive to think the Trump administration wouldn't take the opportunity to \"put a flag in the ground\" on Title X. Hasstedt stated, \"The administration has shown its cards to some degree in its opposition to abortion and providers who offer or are affiliated with abortion.\"\n\nPresident Trump signed a bill earlier this year allowing states to defund Planned Parenthood for political reasons, reversing a last-minute rule signed by former President Obama. The Trump administration's fiscal 2018 budget request also would have excluded Planned Parenthood affiliates from all forms of federal funding, but that provision has yet to pass Congress. That leaves Title X as the most plausible route for the administration to crack down on abortion providers.\n\nWhile federal dollars, including Title X grants, can't be used to pay for abortions, critics argue that the money is fungible and could still indirectly support the procedure if it goes to groups that perform abortions like Planned Parenthood. That's the argument for resurrecting Reagan-era restrictions requiring a physical and financial separation between Title X projects and abortion services, including separate waiting and examination rooms, separate staff, and separate accounting records.\n\nRestoring these regulations could take months, but groups that support them say it would make certain that absolutely no federal funds go toward abortion. David Christensen, vice president of government affairs at the Family Research Council, stated, \"Doing this would not prevent organizations like Planned Parenthood necessarily from getting Title X funds. It would mean though that the Title X family planning program would have to be physically and financially separate from an organization's abortion activities.\"\n\nGuttmacher's Kinsey stated that the possible changes to Title X would have a big impact on women, especially those living in underserved communities. \"Any attempt to undermine this program or the providers or women's access to affordable care would be a huge setback and would definitely impact these women in these communities and represents a really unacceptable disruption of the program,\" Kinsey said.",
    " Title: FBI Director James Comey Criticizes Wikileaks, Echoing CIA Head Mike Pompeo's Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nFBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the FBI's investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. During the hearing, Comey expressed criticism towards WikiLeaks, distinguishing it from legitimate news sources.\n\nComey stated, \"It crosses a line when it moves from being about educating a public to intelligence porn, just pushing out information...just to damage the United States.\" He added, \"There's nothing that even smells journalist about some of this content.\" Comey also noted that during legitimate investigations, the focus would usually fall on leakers.\n\nComey's comments on WikiLeaks seem to mirror CIA head Mike Pompeo's criticisms of the organization, made just a couple of weeks prior. In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Pompeo declared, \"We can no longer allow [Julian] Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us.\"\n\nIt is important to note that no official should define journalism, as this implicitly sanctions government action against whistleblowers and other leakers. However, the irony of the FBI director, an agency with a history of illegal and ineffective subterfuge, criticizing media legitimacy, is noteworthy.\n\nIn a four-year period, the FBI authorized criminal activity by confidential informants over 22,000 times. The FBI's criticism of WikiLeaks comes during a time when the current president has publicly expressed antagonism towards the press, calling for the \"loosening\" of libel laws regarding public figures and elected officials, and declaring war on the media.\n\nThe relationship between Comey and President Donald Trump is complex, with Trump publicly opposing Comey over the latter's refusal to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton. The spectacle of the two figures, each with their own controversies, adds to the intrigue of the ongoing investigation.\n\nWhile it is inappropriate to expect U.S. officials to embrace WikiLeaks and other sources that reveal government activities, there is no doubt that WikiLeaks has forced transparency in ways that have greatly benefited the public.",
    " Title: Ross Perot, Billionaire and Independent Presidential Candidate, Dies at 89\n\nArticle:\n\nRoss Perot, the billionaire businessman who mounted two unsuccessful third-party presidential campaigns in the 1990s, died Tuesday, according to family spokesman James Fuller. He was 89. Perot died after a five-month battle with leukemia, Fuller said.\n\nPerot, a self-made billionaire by his mid-50s after selling a controlling interest in the data processing business he founded to General Motors for $2.5 billion, gained national recognition for his colorful political career. His Texas twang, populist platform, and frequent television appearances made him one of the more memorable political figures of the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1992 election, Perot garnered nearly 19% of the vote and finished third behind Bill Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush. For years, Bush blamed Perot for his defeat, stating in a 2012 HBO documentary that he believed Perot \"cost me the election.\" However, election experts and scholarly research have challenged that theory, with The New York Times finding Perot's effect on the election's outcome to be \"minimal,\" and The Washington Post reporting Clinton would have still won by a large margin if Perot had not run.\n\nIn 1995, Perot created the Reform Party, and the following year, he received 8% of the vote in the presidential election as the party's candidate. Following his second and final bid for the presidency, Perot served as president and CEO of Perot Systems Corporation, which he founded in 1988. He was the head of the company until 2000, when he passed the title on to his son, Ross Perot Jr. Nine years later, Dell Incorporated bought Perot Systems for $3.9 billion, resulting in a net gain of about $400 million for the Perot family.\n\nAside from his business and political careers, Perot also received national attention for his efforts during the Vietnam War to create better conditions for US prisoners of war. He traveled to Laos, where he met with ambassadors from Russia and North Vietnam, and was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by the Department of Defense in 1974 for his efforts. In 1979, when two EDS employees were taken hostage during a revolution in Iran, he organized and paid for a successful private mission called Operation Hotfoot to rescue the men and bring them home.\n\n\"In business and in life, Ross was a man of integrity and action. A true American patriot and a man of rare vision, principle, and deep compassion, he touched the lives of countless people through his unwavering support of the military and veterans and through his charitable endeavors,\" Fuller said in a statement. \"Ross Perot will be deeply missed by all who loved him. He lived a long and honorable life.\"\n\nHenry Ray Perot, who later legally changed his name to Henry Ross, was born on June 27, 1930, in Texarkana, Texas, where his father ran a cotton mill. By the time he was 7 years old, Perot was an accomplished horseman and a budding businessman. His father was training him to make a profit by buying and selling bridles.\n\nPerot graduated from the Naval Academy in 1953 and spent four years at sea. After the Navy, Perot worked as a salesman at IBM before starting his own corporation, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), in 1962 with a $1,000 loan from his wife, Margot. The company grew quickly, and when the company went public in 1968, Fortune magazine put Perot on its cover, calling him the \"fastest, richest Texan.\" He later sold a controlling interest in EDS to General Motors, becoming a billionaire and GM's single largest stockholder and a director. He netted approximately $750 million in 1986 when he resigned from the General Motors board of directors as part of a buyout agreement and sold his GM shares.\n\nAlthough he had never held public office, by the early 1990s, Perot, sensing an opportunity for an outsider campaign with an anti-Washington message, was openly talking about a presidential run. Speaking to CNN's Larry King in 1992, he said that if he were to launch a campaign, he would run as an independent and \"get both parties' heads straight.\"\n\n\"I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family, (but) this situation got so bad that I decided I better get into it,\" he later said during a presidential debate. At one point during the summer of 1992, Perot dropped out, stating he could not win and that staying in the race would only create problems for the electoral process. His withdrawal came shortly after he stumbled during a speech at the NAACP, where his comments on unemployment were interpreted as patronizing and insensitive.\n\n\"Few people in this country have been able to live the American Dream to the extent that I have,\" Perot said when he re-entered, adding, \"Neither political party has effectively addressed the issues that concern the American people.\"",
    " Title: GOP's Use of the \"Nuclear Option\" in Supreme Court Nomination: A Look at American Political History and the Impact on Senate Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate surrounding the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court has sparked discussions about the Republican Party's potential use of the so-called \"nuclear option\" to bypass a filibuster and confirm the nominee with a simple majority vote. This move, while not unprecedented in American history, represents a high degree of partisanship in the post\u2013World War II era, according to Brian Balogh, co-host of the BackStory With the American History Guys podcast and a professor of history at the University of Virginia.\n\nThe Senate Republicans are expected to move to a vote on Gorsuch's nomination on Thursday, with Senate Democrats planning to filibuster to block the vote. In response, the Republicans may change the rules of the Senate to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, requiring only a simple majority of votes for confirmation. This move has been met with disapproval from both parties, but it is likely to occur.\n\nThe gradual ratcheting up of partisanship in the Senate has been underway since the 1980s, according to Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and the author of \"Stalemate: Causes and Consequences of Legislative Gridlock.\" Binder explains that this particular move is part of a long-term parliamentary arms race between the two parties, with the Republican use of the nuclear option being a natural response to previous episodes where the minority has exploited the rules and the majority has fought back.\n\nThe use of the nuclear option will make bipartisan cooperation in the future even harder, as neither party will have incentives to compromise. The removal of institutional incentives to compromise or move towards a more consensual position across party lines will likely lead to a more scorched-earth policy, according to Balogh.\n\nIn order to address the partisanship problem, there are two solutions: either the voters stop rewarding extremism or lawmakers discover mutually beneficial compromises. Binder suggests that, despite the current polarized climate, lawmakers can still find issues on which both parties can win by enlarging the policy pie and giving each party its preferred outcome. Balogh agrees, stating that the American public will have to decide that they care more about effective governance than their party allegiances.\n\nIn conclusion, the Republican use of the nuclear option in the Supreme Court nomination process is a significant event in American political history, representing a high degree of partisanship in the post\u2013World War II era. The move will make bipartisan cooperation more difficult, and the future of the Senate will depend on the American public's willingness to reward compromise or the ability of lawmakers to find mutually beneficial compromises.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Debate: Analysis of the Second Night\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second night of the 2020 Democratic presidential debates took place on Thursday, with ten candidates participating. The debates were broadcast on YouTube.\n\nAccording to several media outlets, Senator Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg were considered the winners of the debate, while Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden were considered the losers.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, who was expected to perform well following a solid showing in the previous debate, was criticized for his aggressive and short-on-details approach. His Medicare-for-all plan and free college plan were subject to criticism, particularly from Mayor Buttigieg, who argued against subsidizing college for billionaires' children. Sanders' performance was described as wearing thin as the debate progressed.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden faced criticism, particularly from Senator Kamala Harris, on the issue of race. Harris was praised for her tough and measured approach, demonstrating her ability to challenge not just fellow Democrats but also President Trump in the future.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg were highlighted as the standout candidates of the night. Both candidates were praised for their leadership skills, policy acumen, and authenticity, traits that are attractive to voters regardless of gender, race, or sexual orientation.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris' strong performance was marked by her clear and measured answers, direct and pointed shots, and personal examples. Her challenge to former Vice President Joe Biden on the issue of race was particularly notable.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg's big challenge came when he was asked about the ongoing lack of minority representation on South Bend's police force. He admitted his failure to address the issue and spoke about his community's pain, accomplishments, and future plans. His self-criticism was praised as rare and thoughtful in politics.\n\nThe debate was also marked by Senator Elizabeth Warren's solid performance, and Senator Amy Klobuchar's strong showing, particularly on the issue of healthcare.\n\nIn conclusion, the second night of the 2020 Democratic presidential debates saw Senator Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg emerge as the standout candidates, with Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden facing criticism for their performances. The debates provided a valuable opportunity for the candidates to showcase their policies, leadership skills, and authenticity to the American public.",
    " Title: Boeing Experiences First Annual Loss of Commercial Airplane Orders in Decades\n\nArticle:\n\nBoeing, the aerospace giant, ended 2020 with a negative order count for commercial airplanes, marking the first time this has occurred in decades, according to a report by CNBC. The company reported a loss of 87 airplane orders, indicating more cancellations than new orders.\n\nThe high rate of cancellations is a sign of the ongoing impact of the crisis surrounding the 737 Max, an airplane involved in two fatal crashes that claimed the lives of 346 people. Boeing's order book for the troubled jet shrank by 183 planes, with much of the decline attributed to the bankruptcy of low-cost overseas airlines like India's Jet Airways and Vietnam's VietJet. However, ongoing issues with getting the 737 Max certified led to insufficient demand to offset the losses.\n\nThere was a 90 percent drop in orders for 737 models during the year, according to CNN. Boeing barely had any firm orders for the Max after the grounding in mid-March, and other models also suffered a 29 percent drop in new orders.\n\nAmerican Airlines extended its cancellations for the 737 Max until June 4th, after previously targeting April 7th. The carrier has repeatedly pushed back the date as Boeing continues to struggle to secure regulatory approval for the 737 Max.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max jets after two deadly crashes in October 2018 and March 2019. Both crashes have been linked to a piece of software known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that Boeing had installed on the 737 Max.\n\nRecently, Boeing has been embroiled in a new controversy involving internal messages in which employees discussed the problems with the 737 Max in ways the company characterized as \"completely unacceptable.\" In the chats and emails released by congressional investigators, employees mocked regulators, expressed concerns about flying the 737 Max themselves, and described interactions with FAA officials as cover-ups.\n\nThe messages reveal Boeing's attempts to reduce the amount of simulator training required by the FAA to certify pilots for the 737 Max. Last week, the company announced it would recommend simulator training for pilots of its 737 Max jets after previously stating that such training was unnecessary.\n\nBoeing originally sold the 737 Max to carriers on the promise they wouldn't have to pay for pilot training on simulators, which can be costly for airlines.

The Homebase data showed a nearly 40 percent improvement for small business activity in May, which fell to 6 percent across all of June.\n\nStates experiencing infection surges, such as Texas, have reported layoffs and business closures, even before officials reimpose some restrictions on economic activity. Foot traffic to retailers and other businesses declined in the third week of June in several large cities across southern states, where infections have spiked, according to an analysis of Safegraph.com data by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nFurthermore, data from 40 million households compiled by the financial firm Commerce Signals shows that after weeks of improvement, credit and debit card spending declined at the end of May across most states. This pattern, which economists have been dreading, represents a departure from the \"rocket ship\" recovery that President Trump promised in June.\n\nFederal Reserve officials have warned publicly that the recovery appears perilous and highly dependent on public health. \"The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus,\" Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell told a House committee on Tuesday. \"A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities.\"\n\nThe next few months of recovery could be rocky even if the current infection surge abates. Job losses have slowed but remain at levels higher than in any previous recession, and a growing share of workers now report they have been laid off permanently, rather than temporarily furloughed. A significant share of small businesses have still not reopened, even as states increasingly lift restrictions on their operations, suggesting some of them may be shuttered for good. By many measures, business activity and employment remains down by a quarter or more from pre-crisis levels.",
    " Title: Trump Declares Hillary Clinton as \"Real Enemy\" in Exclusive Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nPresumptive Republican nominee for President, Donald Trump, declared former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his main adversary in an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday evening. The interview took place before the polls closed in Indiana, as Trump was securing the GOP nomination for the presidency.\n\nTrump's interview aimed to unify the Republican Party and focus on Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, whom he referred to as the \"real enemy.\" He stated, \"The real enemy is Hillary Clinton and four more years of essentially Obama.\" Trump criticized Clinton's positions on trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, her opposition to securing the U.S. border with Mexico, and her stance on a strong American military.\n\nTrump expressed confidence in his ability to bring jobs back to America, stating that NAFTA, signed by Clinton's husband, is the worst economic development deal in U.S. history. He asserted that Clinton would not be able to compete with him on jobs and the economy, the border, or the military.\n\nRegarding his vice presidential pick, Trump indicated that he would choose a political figure, rather than a businessperson, to help navigate the political landscape and get things done in Congress. Trump did not reveal any potential running mates but stated that he would close the nomination process before making a vice presidential selection.\n\nTrump also attributed the high Republican primary turnout and low Democrat turnout to his strong performance in the general election. He claimed that the high turnout was a sign of his electability, stating, \"It's up more than 70 percent... This week we'll break the all-time record with many states left.\" Trump also suggested that he would have had more votes than Clinton if he had faced only one serious competitor during the primaries.",
    " Title: GOP Senator Criticizes President Trump's Border Wall Funding Demand as a \"Made-Up Fight\"\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, has criticized President Trump's determination to secure funding for a border wall, labeling it as a \"made-up fight.\" In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Corker stated, \"This is a made-up fight so the president can look like he's fighting, but even if he wins, our borders are going to be insecure.\"\n\nCorker, a frequent critic of the president, argued that the White House is proposing the wrong solution, suggesting that the focus should be on more sophisticated technology. He compared the situation to suggesting the use of the Wright brothers' technology in the Pentagon instead of modern stealth fighters.\n\n\"It's not just about the money, it's what we're spending it on,\" Corker said.\n\nThe current stalemate between President Trump and Democratic leaders over the border wall funding has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government. Corker asserted, \"We could secure our borders. We could solve this problem. This is a made-up fight.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, President Trump stated that technology is fine but that the wall is essential, saying, \"It is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!\" The president also tweeted, \"The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier.\"\n\nThe ongoing debate between the president and Democratic leaders continues as they seek a resolution to the funding impasse.",
    " Title: House Oversight Committee Schedules Vote to Consider Contempt Charges Against Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has scheduled a vote for next week to consider holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over the controversial Fast and Furious gun-tracking operation. The vote is scheduled for June 20.\n\nCommittee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) released a 64-page memo in early May outlining the case for holding the attorney general in contempt. Issa's argument is based on Holder's failure to respond to an October 2011 subpoena for internal Justice Department documents on the operation.\n\nThe Obama administration has not asserted Executive Privilege or any other valid privilege over these materials, and it is unacceptable that the Department of Justice refuses to produce them, Issa said in a statement Monday, accusing Holder of having \"failed to meet his legal obligations.\" He said the Justice Department has \"obstructed the investigation,\" adding that the department \"can still stop the process of contempt\" by delivering key documents.\n\nIn a separate statement, House Speaker John Boehner said the department is \"out of excuses.\" The Justice Department maintains that it has cooperated with the investigation and provided thousands of documents. Holder has testified before the committee at least eight times about Fast and Furious, most recently on Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler called the scheduled vote \"unfortunate and unwarranted.\" She said there had been \"ongoing discussions\" with committee staff about a \"mutually acceptable resolution\" to their information requests.\n\n\"From the beginning, Chairman Issa has distorted the facts, ignored testimony and flung inaccurate accusations at the attorney general and others, and this latest move fits within that tired political playbook that has so many Americans disillusioned with Washington,\" she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Monday also noted that Justice has provided 7,600 pages of documents to date and provided testimony during \"hours and hours\" of congressional hearings. He suggested the vote next week is political.\n\nAt Thursday's hearing, Issa grilled Holder in a particularly heated exchange where he accused the attorney general of failing to answer questions about the investigation.\n\n\"Have you and your attorneys produced internally the materials responsive to the subpoenas?\" Issa asked.\n\n\"We believe that we have responded to the subpoenas,\" Holder began.\n\n\"No. Mr. Attorney General, you're not a good witness. A good witness answers the question asked,\" Issa snapped.\n\nThe Fast and Furious program oversaw sales of nearly 2,000 firearms to suspected Mexican drug cartels in an attempt to trace gun trafficking. But the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recovered only 567 of the guns. Most controversially, many of the guns were found at violent crime scenes, including at the shooting of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.\n\nThe Republican leadership initially hedged on fully supporting Issa's case due to concerns that charging the attorney general in contempt in an election year could backfire. At the same time, they tried to allay concerns from conservatives -- particularly freshmen -- who called for Holder's resignation.\n\nSix House Republican freshmen wrote to the leadership on May 18 to push for a contempt of Congress resolution against Holder. Hours later, Boehner, R-Ohio, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., issued a letter to Holder demanding that he fully cooperate with the Oversight Committee investigation. They also warned that \"if necessary, the House will act to fulfill our constitutional obligations in the coming weeks.\"\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the latest announcement is \"straightforward and necessary.\"\n\n\"Contempt is the only tool Congress has to enforce a subpoena,\" he said.\n\nBut Issa's Democratic counterpart on the House oversight committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., called the committee's action \"unfortunate.\"\n\n\"I am guardedly optimistic that a path forward exists that will serve the legitimate interests of the Committee in conducting rigorous oversight, protect the legitimate interests of the Department in its ongoing investigations and prosecutions, and avoid the needless politicization of this very serious issue,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHolder would join only one other attorney general, Janet Reno in 1998, to be held in contempt by the Oversight Committee. The last time the House voted to find an executive branch official in contempt was in 2008 over the U.S. attorney firings controversy. It passed a resolution against White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers for failing to provide internal documents. Miers also refused to comply with a subpoena to appear at a hearing. The House Judiciary Committee also found White House adviser Karl Rove in contempt later that year over the same issue.",
    " Title: Age Differences in Attention to COVID-19 News Among U.S. Adults\n\nArticle:\n\nA survey conducted by Pew Research Center's Election News Pathways project revealed that 92% of U.S. adults were closely following news about the COVID-19 pandemic in late March. However, significant differences in attention to the pandemic emerged by age, particularly between the youngest and oldest Americans.\n\nMore than two-thirds of adults ages 65 or older (69%) said they were following news of the pandemic very closely, while about four-in-ten Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 (42%) reported the same level of attention. Those adults ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 fell in between.\n\nThese differences persisted over time. As the public's attention to news about the coronavirus outbreak grew from the first half to the second half of March, the growth was not equal across all age groups, with attention among the youngest cohort remaining behind others.\n\nThe survey was administered from March 10-16, 2020, among 8,914 U.S. adults, and again from March 19-24 among 11,537 adults. In this short period, overall attention to news about the outbreak remained extremely high, with the share following it very closely rising from 51% to 57% over this period.\n\nSome age groups intensified their attention, while others did not. The portion of those ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 following the news very closely grew about 10 percentage points. On the other hand, the portion of those ages 18-29 and 65 and older following coronavirus news very closely remained largely unchanged.\n\nFrom mid to late March, the percentage following COVID-19 news very closely grew among middle-aged groups, while youngest adults remained least engaged. The share of those ages 30 to 49 who said they were following coronavirus coverage very closely rose 10 percentage points, from 44% to 54%. Among people ages 50 to 64, the percentage following news about the pandemic very closely rose by nine points \u2013 up from 54% to 63%.\n\nAttention among those ages 65 and older did not change much between the two time periods, but this may largely be due to their very high level of interest from the outset. Even during the first survey, fully two-thirds said they were following news very closely, something that could reflect both the news consumption habits of senior citizens as well as warnings that they were among those most vulnerable to the new virus. In the March 16-24 survey, that number remained largely unchanged at 69%.\n\nHowever, the increasingly sobering news of the pandemic had little impact on the group paying the least attention, those 18 to 29 years of age. Four-in-ten said they were following news about the virus very closely in the first survey, a figure that remained almost the same later in March (42%).\n\nOverall, the youngest adults, those ages 18 to 29, are the least likely to say they are following news about the coronavirus very closely, while the oldest adults ages 65 and older are the most likely to do so. This level of engagement remained consistent from mid to late March.\n\nThese measures and more can be explored further in the Election News Pathways data tool, where all of the data associated with this project is available for public use. For more information on the research on public opinion of COVID-19, visit the dataset.

    " Title: House Budget Committee Approves GOP's ObamaCare Repeal and Replacement Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Budget Committee approved the Republican's ObamaCare repeal and replacement plan on Thursday morning in a 19-17 vote. Three Republicans, Dave Brat (Va.), Mark Sanford (S.C.), and Gary Palmer (Ala.), voted against the bill.\n\nThe three dissenting Republicans are members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which opposes the bill due to its similarities to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare). Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) stated that the Budget panel's action brings Republicans \"another step closer toward keeping our promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.\"\n\nThe bill will now move to the House Rules Committee, where leadership may make amendments to address concerns from both conservatives and moderates. The Rules Committee will be the final stop before the bill reaches the floor. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) has announced he will offer an amendment to leadership on Friday, but has not disclosed its content.\n\nIn her opening remarks, Budget Chairwoman Diane Black (R-Tenn.) encouraged conservatives to stay engaged in the process and work towards improving the proposal. The committee approved four non-binding recommendations from Republicans, including a work requirement for able-bodied adults enrolled in Medicaid and a plan to gear the refundable tax credits towards low-income individuals.\n\nUnder the current GOP plan, the credits are based on age, not income, for individuals making up to $75,000. After that, for every $1,000 someone's income increases, they would lose $100 in tax credit. Some Republicans have expressed concern that the tax credits are too generous for those with higher incomes and do not provide enough assistance for older, low-income individuals.\n\nThe work requirement, as well as adjusting the tax credits to provide more help to lower-income individuals, could help bring moderates onboard. The work requirement is generally supported by both conservatives and moderates.\n\nAnother motion approved by the committee would recommend giving states the option to accept their Medicaid funding through block grants. The current GOP plan only allows per-capita caps. Members of the Freedom Caucus are pushing for changes to the legislation, warning that the bill creates a new entitlement program by providing refundable tax credits to help people buy insurance. They also want the changes to Medicaid in the legislation to take effect earlier.\n\nThe White House has stated it is working with leadership on a manager's amendment to the bill, but has not provided details. The Republican Study Committee wants the bill to include a quicker Medicaid freeze and work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus has also announced he will offer an amendment to leadership on Friday that he claims could address both conservative and moderate concerns.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have a narrow margin for error once the healthcare bill reaches the floor. At least 15 Republicans have stated they will vote against the bill or are leaning against it, according to CQ Roll Call's Whip List, while many more are undecided. Twenty-two defections would be enough to defeat the bill on the floor.\n\nIn the Senate, some Republicans are privately expressing hope that the House bill will fail, given the challenges they could face in trying to pass the measure.",
    " Title: Sanders' Improved Chances in Democratic Primary, but Obstacles Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, has reportedly raised approximately $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, bringing his total fundraising to nearly $100 million. This places him ahead of all other candidates in fundraising, a factor that historically has been indicative of primary success.\n\nAccording to data from the past 14 primary elections where an incumbent was not running, candidates who led in fundraising at this point have gone on to win the nomination nine times. Even when a candidate is trailing in national polls, as Sanders currently is, the leader has won three out of five times. This includes past candidates like Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nJoe Biden, however, leads in endorsements from members of Congress and governors, with 33 such endorsements. Historically, candidates who lead in endorsements at this point have a strong track record of winning primaries, having gone on to win the nomination 10 out of 14 times. When a candidate like Biden leads in the polls and endorsements, they have won 7 out of 9 nominations.\n\nSanders is reportedly preparing to differentiate himself from his fellow Democratic candidates by highlighting contrasts on key issues, such as the Iraq War, where Sanders opposed the invasion and Biden supported it. Sanders' strategy is to use these contrasts to attract votes from other candidates. The question remains whether Sanders will use these critiques in television ads in states like Iowa and New Hampshire as the voting dates approach.\n\nSome caution that Sanders may face challenges in taking down Biden on the Iraq War issue, as he was unable to do so in the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton. The issue may be less potent than it once was, and Sanders may face competition from other candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg, who is perceived as authoritative on national security and can criticize Trump for using a 'bone spur' deferment to avoid the Vietnam War.\n\nOthers argue that Sanders is well-positioned to use the escalating hostilities in the Middle East as an opportunity to highlight his alternative policy. Sanders has a long record as an anti-war activist, dating back to the Vietnam War. In 2016, he gained traction by contrasting his vote against the Iraq War with Hillary Clinton's vote in favor. In the current race, Sanders has staked out a radical foreign policy that includes ending the 'forever wars', using aid money as leverage to push Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians, and making climate change a cornerstone of American foreign policy.\n\nThe difficulty for Sanders is that if he raises the salience of foreign policy, he will have to argue against not only Trump but also former President Barack Obama. The safer course for Sanders would be to focus on domestic policy, where his popular policies distinguish him enough to potentially carry him to victory. However, Trump's recklessness might make that safer path impossible, as the United States is already in a de facto war with Iran. If that war becomes a large-scale conflict, Sanders may have no choice but to run as the only true anti-war candidate.\n\nIn the absence of a coordinated effort to stop Sanders' ascending campaign from former President Obama's top lieutenants, some have interpreted this as a lack of a 'NeverBernie' movement. With less than a month before voting begins, Obama has declined to offer a preferred pick to take on President Trump in 2020, only occasionally expressing concerns about moving too far left and reminding voters to be 'rooted in reality' when exploring nominee options.",
    " Title: U.S. Senate Leaders Disagree on Witness Testimony for Impeachment Trial of President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. senators are in disagreement over the shape of an impeachment trial for President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating he has not ruled out hearing from witnesses, as Democrats have demanded.\n\nIn an interview with \"Fox & Friends\" on Monday, McConnell stopped short of agreeing to a Democratic request for the Senate to agree ahead of time to take testimony during the trial expected to begin in early 2020. He cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, as a model.\n\n\"We haven't ruled out witnesses,\" McConnell said. \"We've said, 'Let's handle this case just like we did with President Clinton.' Fair is fair.\"\n\nDuring the 1999 trial, senators went through opening arguments, had a written question period, and decided what witnesses to call. There was limited testimony by video. Allowing witness testimony, particularly from current and former administration officials, was likely to prolong the trial and could bring up new evidence damaging to Republican Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last week.\n\nChuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, said the trial must include witnesses. He urged his Senate colleagues to call for the release of relevant Trump administration documents.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine a trial not having documents and witnesses. If it doesn't have documents and witnesses, it's going to seem - to most of the American people - that it is a sham trial, a show trial,\" Schumer said at a press conference in New York.\n\nThe House voted along party lines to impeach Trump on two charges over his pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and Biden's son. Biden is a potential Democratic candidate to run against Trump in the November 2020 election. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nTrump was charged with abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. He has said he did nothing wrong. There is little chance Trump will be convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nTrump on Monday accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a bid to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an accord with Schumer on trial rules. McConnell said the Senate could not take any action until it receives the articles.\n\n\"What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial? None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate, or let her default & lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\nSchumer has requested to have four witnesses subpoenaed for the trial. The White House blocked all four, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, from testifying during impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives in December.",
    " Title: Rep. Ayanna Pressley Introduces Resolution for Impeachment Inquiry into Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), a member of the \"Squad\" in the U.S. Congress, is planning to introduce a resolution on Tuesday calling for an impeachment inquiry into Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The resolution comes in response to a New York Times report that included a new allegation of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh's college years, although the alleged victim later stated that the incident did not occur.\n\nIn a statement, Pressley expressed support for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, two women who came forward during Kavanaugh's confirmation process. \"I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez,\" Pressley said in a statement shared by Boston.com reporter Nik DeCosta-Klipa, which Pressley retweeted from her official Twitter account. \"It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors.\"\n\nThe resolution calls for the House of Representatives to investigate whether impeachment proceedings should be initiated against Brett Kavanaugh. It also requests that the House Judiciary Committee conduct depositions and take affidavits, with subpoenas issued as necessary.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who heads the House Judiciary Committee, has not expressed support for impeaching Kavanaugh. However, he stated that impeaching the president is currently a top priority for his committee.\n\nGOP leaders have criticized the renewed allegations against Kavanaugh, with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stating that the situation is not normal political behavior. Several Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas), and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment following the initial Times report.\n\nThe original Times piece, adapted from a forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Max Stier, witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends allegedly pushed Kavanaugh's penis into the hand of a female student. By late Sunday, the paper had revised its story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question.",
    " Title: NSA Taps into Google and Yahoo Data Links, Report Says\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) has reportedly tapped directly into communications links used by Google and Yahoo to move large amounts of email and other user information among overseas data centers, according to a report by The Washington Post. The report, based on secret NSA documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden, appears to show the agency has used weak restrictions on its overseas activities to exploit major U.S. companies' data to a far greater extent than previously realized.\n\nThe operation, code-named MUSCULAR, reportedly gained access to a cable or switch that relayed the traffic through an unnamed telecommunications provider. The interception occurs outside the United States, which means there is no oversight by the secret intelligence court.\n\nGoogle chief legal officer David Drummond expressed outrage over the reported program, stating, \"We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.\" Google recently began speeding its efforts to encrypt internal traffic, but the company reportedly was not aware of the program.\n\nLike other companies, Google and Yahoo constantly send data over leased and shared or exclusive international fiber-optic telecommunication lines as they synchronize information. The newly disclosed program, operated jointly with the United Kingdom's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), amassed 181 million records in one recent 30-day span, according to one document reported by The Washington Post. However, it is unavailable how much of that included material from U.S. residents, how the agency redacted data on them, or how much of the information was retained.\n\nAn NSA spokesperson stated that the suggestion in the Post article that the agency relies on a presidential order on foreign intelligence gathering to skirt domestic restrictions imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other laws \"is not true.\" The statement also denied that the agency collects vast quantities of U.S. persons' data from this type of collection.\n\nNSA Director General Keith Alexander, when asked about the latest report, stated that the agency did not have unfettered access to Google and Yahoo servers. He also did not directly address whether the agency intercepts such traffic in transit. The NSA is known to tap undersea cables.\n\nA Yahoo spokeswoman stated, \"We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency.\" Yahoo reportedly will begin encrypting users' email as it moves to the company, but it declined to say whether it would go further and keep email encrypted as it moves within Yahoo.\n\nThe report is likely to add to growing tensions between the U.S. intelligence establishment and the tech companies, which have been struggling to assure customers overseas that they need not fear U.S. spying. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy stated he would ask for an administration briefing on the program because millions of U.S. residents could have had their communications monitored daily. Leahy also stated he would be asking whether this report is accurate, what legal authority the government is using, and how they are protecting the privacy rights of law-abiding Americans.",
    " Title: Tea Party Conservatives and Healthcare Reform: A Long-Term Effort to Defund and Repeal the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Tea Party conservatives have found allies in their efforts to defund and potentially shut down the government over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, founder of the House Tea Party Caucus, stated on the eve of the potential shutdown that \"this is exactly what the public wants.\" However, not all advocacy groups are fully aligned with the defunding campaign. For instance, Americans for Prosperity, a group financed by the Koch brothers and active in health care television advertisements, is more focused on sowing public doubts about the law rather than defunding it.\n\nTim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, stated that the group aims to spend \"tens of millions\" of dollars on a multi-front effort that includes preventing states from expanding Medicaid under the law. The group's goal is not to defund the law but to repeal it. \"We want to see this law repealed,\" Mr. Phillips said.\n\nIn August, a \"Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour\" was held at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas, Texas, featuring Tea Party movement stars Senator Ted Cruz and former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint. Cruz, who led the defunding effort, declared, \"You're here because now is the single best time we have to defund Obamacare.\" Cruz later delivered a 21-hour monologue against the law on the Senate floor in September.\n\nThe tactic of defunding legislation through spending bills is not new in Washington. For years, Congress has attached the Hyde Amendment to spending bills, banning the use of federal money for most abortions, except in cases of incest and rape. After the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, former Republican congressman Todd Tiahrt proposed defunding parts of the law. He discussed the idea with Speaker John Boehner's staff while the Supreme Court was considering the law's constitutionality.",
    " Title: Judge Dismisses Defamation Lawsuit Against Former British Spy Christopher Steele in Washington DC\n\nArticle:\n\nA judge in Washington DC has dismissed a defamation lawsuit against former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier alleging links between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. The lawsuit was filed by three Russian oligarchs who claimed Steele defamed them by writing that they tried to influence the 2016 US election.\n\nSteele's lawyers argued that the legal action was frivolous and an attempt to silence him. On Monday, a judge agreed, stating that Steele has a right to his opinion. Lawyers for Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and German Khan had argued that Steele was not entitled to free speech protections under the First Amendment to the US Constitution, as he is not a citizen of the United States. However, Judge Anthony Epstein disagreed, writing in his judgment that \"advocacy on issues of public interest has the capacity to inform public debate, and thereby furthers the purposes of the First Amendment, regardless of the citizenship or residency of the speakers.\"\n\nThe judge also cited Washington DC's anti-SLAPP law, which prevents parties from filing lawsuits to tamp down on opposing political views. Steele's American lawyer, Christy Hull Eikhoff, said the court had shown support for the first amendment and the \"profound national principle\" that debate should be \"uninhibited, robust, and wide open.\"\n\nThis is a significant victory for Christopher Steele, who had argued through his lawyers that the owners of Alfa Bank, referred to as \"Alpha\" in the dossier, were trying to intimidate him into silence. The court in Washington DC said Steele should have the same guarantees of free speech \u2013 under the First Amendment to the US Constitution \u2013 as American citizens. Specifically, the court said, he should get the protection given by legislation designed to stop lawsuits being used by rich individuals to stop public debate.\n\nAlfa's owners accused Steele of acting maliciously or recklessly when he wrote a headline about \"cooperation\" between \"Alpha\" and the Kremlin in the US presidential election. However, the judgment states that this headline represents Steele's opinion based on what his sources were telling him about the Alfa oligarchs' long relationship with Vladimir Putin, including the claim that they sent him \"large amounts of illicit cash\" when he was deputy mayor of St Petersburg.\n\nIt is true, as the court notes, that the dossier \"does not present any direct evidence that Alfa interfered in the election.\" The FBI has been investigating whether a computer server in Trump Tower was communicating with one belonging to Alfa Bank during the campaign. It is not known what, if anything, the FBI found.\n\nLawyers for the Russian billionaires told the BBC in a statement they would probably appeal the decision. The three billionaires have previously brought a defamation case against Fusion GPS, the Washington DC-based research company that hired Steele. The dossier, containing salacious allegations against President Donald Trump, was first published by BuzzFeed in January 2017.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Steele dossier on Twitter as \"fake\" and \"fraudulent.\" He has also called Steele a \"lowlife\" and claimed that the document was financed by his 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.",

Bernie Sanders (I\u2013Vt.) privately told Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013Mass.) that a woman could not win the presidency during a 2018 meeting. The allegation, which surfaced over the weekend, was based on unnamed sources, likely members of the Warren campaign.\n\nSanders vehemently denied making such a comment, and the issue was brought up during the debate. In an exchange with CNN's Abby Phillip, Sanders reiterated his denial, stating, \"I never said that.\" When asked, \"You're saying that you never told Senator Warren that a woman could not win the election?\" Sanders responded, \"Correct.\"\n\nIn a subsequent question, Phillip asked Warren, \"What did you think when Sen. Sanders said a woman could not win the election?\" However, Phillip did not directly ask Warren about Sanders' alleged comment, instead presuming its truth.\n\nFollowing the debate, CNN ran a headline, \"Sanders denies saying a woman can't be president,\" which some interpret as implying that Sanders is denying an objective reality, despite the lack of evidence supporting the allegation and the absence of a specific inquiry into Warren's recollection of the statement.\n\nThe exchange and subsequent headline have sparked criticism, with some accusing CNN of implicitly taking Warren's side and missing an opportunity to shed light on the rare dispute between Sanders and Warren. The controversy has been a topic of discussion among Sanders' most fervent online supporters.",
    " Title: Intelligence Community's Refusal to Brief Congress on Russian Election Interference Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions on Capitol Hill escalated on Wednesday night as a scheduled House Intelligence Committee briefing on alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election was canceled due to the intelligence community's alleged \"intransigence.\" Representative Peter King (R-N.Y.), a member of the committee, expressed his displeasure to Fox News' \"The Kelly File,\" stating, \"It's their job to come. They don't have any choice. They have to come in, especially when they have created this.\"\n\nThe initial request for a closed, classified briefing was made by Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to the FBI, CIA, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and National Security Agency. However, according to Fox News, CIA Director John Brennan declined to provide a briefer, citing the full review requested by President Obama. The other agencies did not respond to the committee's request, which is unusual given the panel is the most-senior committee with jurisdiction.\n\nIn a statement, Nunes expressed his concern, stating, \"The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes.\"\n\nRepresentative King highlighted the irony in the lack of cooperation, stating, \"The consensus was that there was an attempt by the Russians to put a cloud over the election, to create disunity. Well, that's what's happening right now, but it's the intelligence community that's doing it.\"\n\nKing also noted that lawmakers have not received any assessment from the CIA that Russia interfered to help Donald Trump win the presidency over Hillary Clinton, allegations first reported by The Washington Post on Friday.\n\nIn a late Wednesday statement, the intelligence community defended its position, noting that senior administration officials regularly provide \"extensive, detailed classified and unclassified briefings to members and staff from both parties on Capitol Hill.\" The statement added that they are focusing on the review ordered by President Obama on foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections.\n\nKing, referring to recent press reports, said, \"It's almost as if people in the intelligence community are carrying out a disinformation campaign against the president-elect of the United States.\" He added, \"It's absolutely disgraceful, and if they're not doing it, then it must be someone in the House or the Senate who's leaking false information, and there should be a full investigation of this.\"\n\nA Washington Post report on Friday, citing anonymous sources, said the CIA determined Russia interfered in the election with the purpose of helping Trump's campaign. However, as Nunes first noted in a letter on Monday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told their committee on Nov. 17 that the intelligence community lacked strong evidence connecting Russia to the WikiLeaks disclosures.\n\nFurther details about the \"full review\" Obama ordered from his intelligence agencies regarding Russian interference were not available at the time of publication. Fox News reported that the review is being led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and is a multi-agency effort. Investigators plan to take existing intelligence and reconstruct what happened, with a focus on whether there is new intelligence that substantiates analysis that the interference was designed to ensure a Trump victory, or whether a review of the existing intelligence with \"fresh eyes\" leads to new conclusions.",
    " Title: White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus Responds to Allegations of Intelligence Leaks by Evelyn Farkas\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus joined Hugh Hewitt for a Thursday morning interview, where one of the subjects touched on was the allegations made by Evelyn Farkas, formerly the Defense Department's top Russia expert under President Obama. Farkas is now calling for an independent investigation of the President's ties to Moscow.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' on March 2nd, 2017, Farkas appeared to admit to leaking sensitive information about potential spying on President-elect Trump and his transition team. Fox News ran a story on this titled: \"Former Obama official discloses rush to get intelligence on Trump team.\"\n\nIn the Farkas statement in question, she said:\n\n\"I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy... that the Trump folks \u2013 if they found out how we knew what we knew about their... the Trump staff dealing with Russians \u2013 that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence.\"\n\nFollowing this, President Trump tweeted: \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" on March 4th, 2017.\n\nDuring the interview, Hugh Hewitt asked Priebus about Farkas' statement. He responded:\n\n\"It's just an incredible statement, you know, and how, what it means and what she meant by that, and whether that has anything to do with the issues in regard to surveillance of Trump transition team members is something that we need to figure out this morning and throughout the day.\"\n\nPriebus also expressed his personal reaction, stating: \"It's almost, it's so cavalier and unbelievable that I just wonder whether this person knows what the heck she's talking about.\"\n\nWhen asked if Director Comey would be interested in Farkas' statement, Priebus replied: \"I hope that the intelligence committees and agencies are interested in all of these things.\"\n\nRadio hosts Sean Hannity and Mark Levin both mentioned the story Wednesday afternoon. The original clip from MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' is available for viewing.",
    " Title: Reflecting on 50 Years Since Martin Luther King's Speech: A Call for Ending Race-Based Judgment\n\nArticle:\n\nFifty years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech, the author argues that it is time for Americans to stop basing their judgments on skin color. The article discusses the persistence of race-related issues in America, noting that racism, like other human vices, has been a constant feature throughout history.\n\nThe author shares personal experiences, including their parents' immigration to the United States and their own political career in Louisiana, to illustrate that people are more interested in an individual's beliefs and actions rather than their skin color. The author also points out that younger generations seem to pay less attention to skin color than previous generations.\n\nHowever, the article acknowledges that while significant progress has been made in race relations, there are still setbacks. The author laments the shift away from the \"melting pot\" concept, where individuals from diverse backgrounds blend into a unified American culture, towards a focus on hyphenated identities.\n\nThe author suggests a return to the \"melting pot\" idea, emphasizing the unity of Americans as a shared identity, rather than focusing on differences in heritage, ethnicity, or skin color. The article concludes with a call for Americans to move past their \"separateness\" and embrace a more unified, color-blind society. The author emphasizes treating others as individuals and celebrating diversity while resisting the politically correct trend of emphasizing differences.",
    " Title: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Endorses Hillary Clinton as Democratic Nominee and Expresses Readiness for Vice-Presidential Role\n\nArticle:\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has endorsed Hillary Clinton as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee and expressed her readiness to serve as Clinton's running mate. In an interview on MSNBC, Warren was asked by Rachel Maddow if she would accept the vice-presidential nomination, to which she responded affirmatively.\n\nWarren's endorsement came shortly after she praised Clinton as a \"fighter with guts\" who would keep Donald Trump from reaching the White House. In an interview with the Boston Globe on Thursday, Warren endorsed Clinton, stating, \"I'm ready to jump in this fight and make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States and be sure that Donald Trump gets nowhere near the White House.\"\n\nWarren also praised Bernie Sanders, Clinton's primary opponent, for running an \"incredible campaign\" and bringing millions of people into the democratic process. She described Sanders' campaign as \"powerfully important\" and noted that he had thrust important issues into the spotlight.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Vice-President Joe Biden have also given their endorsements to Clinton's candidacy. In a video recorded on Tuesday, Obama stated, \"I'm with her. I don't think there has ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\" Biden, in a speech on Thursday, seemed to give his endorsement, referring to \"... whoever the next president is \u2013 and God willing it will be Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nWarren, a favorite of the progressive left who taught constitutional law at Harvard, is seen as a possible running mate who could help entice back a disaffected left that has been excited by Sanders but ambivalent about Clinton. Warren has been especially critical of Donald Trump, attacking him in a series of speeches and setting herself up for a prominent and pugilistic role in the presidential election, whether she is on the ticket or not.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, at a speech to the American Constitution Society in Washington DC, Warren criticized Trump as \"just a businessman who inherited a fortune and kept it rolling along by cheating people.\" She described Trump as \"a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who... serves no one but himself\" and said his attacks on Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over the Trump University suit, were \"exactly what you would expect from somebody who is a thin-skinned racist bully.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Arizona Immigration Law: Implications for Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Supreme Court ruling on the Arizona immigration law, which struck down much of the state's enforcement efforts, has sparked discussions among political strategists regarding its potential impact on the 2012 presidential race. While the ruling initially seemed to be a setback for Republicans, some GOP strategists believe it could benefit Mitt Romney by providing an opportunity to criticize the Obama administration's handling of illegal immigration.\n\nBrad Blakeman, former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush and a public policy professor at Georgetown University, suggested that Romney should use the ruling to emphasize the president's creation of a \"constitutional crisis\" on immigration. Blakeman argued that the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws allows Arizona's struggle with its own law to highlight the need for a federal approach, which Romney claims to offer.\n\nRomney is advised to assert that Obama should have pursued a more bipartisan approach to create a \"fair, just, and equitable comprehensive policy.\" Blakeman believes the ruling will help Romney in the general election, but the candidate must clearly communicate to the American people that Obama created a constitutional crisis by failing to lead on immigration reform with both houses of Congress.\n\nPresident Obama, on the other hand, argues that Republicans have consistently blocked immigration system reforms. In a recent address to Latino officials in Florida, Obama stated that \"politics\" prevented the passage of the DREAM Act, which would have allowed some illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to remain. Obama has since implemented a similar policy administratively.\n\nOther political strategists suggest that the ruling will give Romney an opportunity to appeal to his supporters but will not significantly impact the election. Don Fowler, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, stated that supporters of the Obama administration, which sued to block the Arizona law, will continue to back Obama despite Monday's ruling. Conversely, Fowler said, those who support Romney will remain loyal, as the country is divided on the issue of illegal immigration.\n\nBen Golnik, a Republican strategist based in Minnesota, stated that Monday's \"split decision\" provides Republicans with ammunition to bolster claims that the Obama administration has poorly handled national immigration issues and has a weak record on border security. Romney, in a statement issued after Monday's ruling, appeared to follow this advice by criticizing Obama's lack of leadership on immigration and the president's failure to present an immigration plan during his first year in office.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling upheld one provision of Arizona's law, requiring law enforcement to check immigration status during routine stops for those they suspect may be in the country illegally. However, the ruling struck down three other provisions, including one that allowed Arizona's law enforcement to arrest those they think might be guilty of a deportable offense.\n\nOther analysts contacted by FoxNews.com, including former South Carolina GOP chairman Van Hipp, Jr., suggested that Romney should now focus on the national security aspects of securing the border. Hipp argued that Romney's campaign must keep its message focused on national security, as the immigration issue brings it to the forefront. Romney is encouraged to emphasize why he supports securing the southern border to maintain national security.",
    " Title: Shifting Landscape of Gay Marriage Support in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in two gay marriage cases this week, the political landscape on this contentious social issue is rapidly evolving. Recent headlines reflect this shift: \"Support for gay marriage is soaring\" (Washington Post), \"Why Republicans Are Saying \u2018I Do\u2019 to Gay Marriage\" (Time), \"The Normalization of Gay Marriage\" (The Atlantic), \"Millennial Support For Gay Marriage Hits All-Time High\" (Huffington Post).\n\nThe changing public opinion, as depicted in these stories, poses particular challenges for Republicans. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who recently voiced his support for same-sex marriage due to his son's homosexuality, has faced support from fellow Republicans, albeit with disagreement on his stance. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is up for re-election this year and is a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has grappled with the issue of \"conversion therapy,\" a controversial practice aimed at changing homosexual individuals into heterosexuals.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich initially expressed support for civil unions but later retracted his statement through a spokesperson. Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia attempted to sidestep the issue with a humorous remark that drew laughter: \"I'm not gay, so I'm not going to marry one.\" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has leaned on his libertarian/states' rights ideology, stating, \"I don't want the government promoting something I don't believe in, but I also don't mind if the government tries to be neutral on the issue.\"\n\nKen Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and head of the 2004 Bush re-election campaign who came out as gay in 2010, has gathered signatures from 131 prominent Republicans to file a friend-of-the-court brief in one of the Supreme Court cases challenging California's Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot measure that defines marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman.\n\nWhen asked on Fox News Sunday if he could envision the next Republican nominee for the White House supporting gay marriage, political strategist Karl Rove responded affirmatively. Margaret Hoover, a former George W. Bush White House aide and leading Republican Party operative, agrees, stating, \"At the rate this issue is changing within the party, I think it's not out of the question.\"\n\nAccording to polls, support for gay marriage is increasing more rapidly among the public than among Republicans. The latest Washington Post/ABC poll reports that 58% of Americans support allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry, compared to 32% in 2009 and 47% in 2012. Among \"millennials\" (individuals born after 1980), support has soared to 70% from 51% when President Obama took office in 2009. The Post/ABC poll also finds that 81% of adults under 30 support same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Republican Party is well aware of this shift in public opinion, having lost this demographic in the 2012 presidential election, when the party platform advocated a marriage amendment to the Constitution and defended the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay scouts and troop leaders. Today, the party's efforts to rebrand itself adopt a softer tone regarding gay rights as part of an overall effort to appear (if not become) more inclusive.\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another potential 2016 presidential candidate, criticized his party for appearing \"anti-everything,\" including \"anti-gay.\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus echoed this sentiment in comments to reporters this past week.\n\n\"I think Senator Portman made some pretty big inroads last week,\" Mr. Priebus said. \"I think it's about being decent. I think it's about dignity and respect, that nobody deserves to have their dignity diminished, or people don't deserve to be disrespected. I think that there isn't anyone in this room \u2013 Republican, Democrat, in the middle \u2013 that doesn't think that Rob Portman, for example, is a good, conservative Republican. He is. And we know that.\"",
    " Title: Fauci's Support for China Travel Restrictions Contradicts Trump's Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News Business, President Trump claimed that Dr. Anthony Fauci disagreed with his decision to restrict travel from China and later agreed that the move saved hundreds of thousands of lives. However, this contradicts statements made by both Trump and Fauci in the past.\n\nAt a coronavirus task force press briefing on April 13, Trump was asked if he and Fauci were \"on the same page.\" Trump responded, \"Yeah, we have been from the beginning.\" During the same press briefing, Fauci discussed the responsiveness of the Trump administration to the recommendations made by the task force. He mentioned that the travel restriction was one of the recommendations they made.\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, Fauci stated that a China travel ban was \"not something that I think we're even considering,\" according to New York Times interviews with White House aides and Fauci himself. By January 30, leading public health officials in the federal government were recommending travel restrictions with China to President Trump. Aides also told the Wall Street Journal that it was Fauci, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar who convinced the initially-skeptical Trump to make the decision.\n\nFauci supported the travel restrictions publicly as well. At the task force press briefing on the day the restrictions were announced, Fauci said that the restrictions were implemented to \"make sure we mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.\" On February 3, the day after the restrictions took effect, Fauci stated on CNBC that the travel restrictions would \"dampen down\" coronavirus cases in the United States.\n\nOn February 7, Fauci told reporters that the positives of travel restrictions with China outweighed the negatives and that \"this decision was not made lightly.\" During the February 29 coronavirus task force press briefing, Fauci repeated the value of the travel restrictions, stating that without them, the U.S. would have had \"many, many more cases\" to deal with.\n\nOn March 15, Fauci said, \"The president's decision to essentially have a major blocking of travel from China, that already had an effect of not seeding the way, in Europe\u2014Italy did not do that.\" On March 22, Fauci said the U.S. was \"not necessarily at all\" on the same trajectory for coronavirus cases as Italy, citing Italy's decision not to \"shut out as well the input of infections that originated in China\" early on as a possible reason the country was hit particularly hard.\n\nFauci has consistently agreed with the travel decision. Indeed, a wide variety of reporting and his public statements make clear he was an early advocate for such restrictions in internal government coronavirus discussions. Based on all available information, Trump was not accurate to say that Fauci criticized the president's decision to restrict travel with China.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Impaneled in Mueller Investigation: A Routine Procedure or Sign of Intensifying Inquiry?\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's recent report of special counsel Robert Mueller impaneling a grand jury in Washington has sparked widespread media attention, with cable networks and online platforms abuzz with discussions about the Russia investigation. The Journal described the move as a sign that Mueller's inquiry is growing in intensity.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the convening of a grand jury is a common practice for prosecutors, and it would have been unusual for Mueller not to use one in this investigation. In fact, as the Journal story acknowledges, a grand jury was already in place, across the river in Alexandria, that the FBI was utilizing in this case before Mueller's appointment.\n\nThe association of \"grand jury\" with \"indictment\" in the public mind may lead to speculation about potential indictments, but it is crucial to remember that a prosecutor's ability to indict does not necessarily imply that charges will be brought against the president or his inner circle. The outcome of the investigation remains uncertain, and even Mueller himself may not yet have determined whether any actions rise to the level of an indictable offense.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the grand jury's existence indicates that investigators are continuing to aggressively gather evidence in the case. USA Today stated that the move would grant Mueller, a former FBI director, significant power to subpoena documents and compel witnesses to testify under oath.\n\nTy Cobb, the president's lawyer, told the Post that the grand jury's existence could potentially accelerate the resolution of Mueller's work. This sentiment makes sense, as grand jury proceedings are intended to be confidential.\n\nHowever, the existence of the grand jury has primarily fueled media speculation, with leaks about the investigation being common, as with the Washington Post's publication of the transcripts of President Trump's January calls to the leaders of Mexico and Australia, following earlier leaks of those conversations.\n\nWhile the grand jury could potentially pose a serious threat to the White House, its existence has, for now, primarily created an orgy of media speculation. It is essential to remain vigilant and informed, but it is equally crucial to maintain a clear understanding of the facts and avoid jumping to conclusions.",
    " Title: The Weekly Standard's Fact-Checking of ThinkProgress' Article on Brett Kavanaugh's Stance on Roe v. Wade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Ian Millhiser, justice editor at ThinkProgress, has expressed discontent with The Weekly Standard, a right-leaning magazine, for labeling one of his articles as \"false.\" The article's headline, \"Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed,\" is, at the very least, quite misleading.\n\nThinkProgress is a left-leaning news site published by the Center for American Progress. The site has previously expressed concerns about Facebook granting fact-checking powers to an explicitly conservative media outlet, a privilege shared by only four other organizations: the Associated Press, Factcheck.org, Politifact, and Snopes.com. Articles tagged as false could potentially lose \"80 percent of future traffic,\" according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and thus the stakes are high for media organizations.\n\nAccording to Millhiser, \"At its peak, Facebook provided as much as 40 percent of ThinkProgress' traffic.\" Facebook's recent algorithm changes have reduced the amount of traffic it sends to most news outlets, but it still accounts for between 10 to 15 percent of their readers. The difference between keeping these readers and losing them could determine whether ThinkProgress can hire more reporters to continue reporting on subjects that The Weekly Standard may have ideological disagreements about.\n\nAs a legal matter, Facebook is treading on dangerous ground by providing no oversight of its own \"fact-checking\" operation. In the landmark case New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court held that a media outlet can be liable for defamation if it publishes false information \"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\" By deferring to The Weekly Standard's \"expertise and process,\" Facebook acted with reckless disregard of whether The Weekly Standard's article was false or not.\n\nMillhiser appears to believe that (1) The Weekly Standard erred in labeling the article false, (2) Facebook erred in granting The Weekly Standard this power in the first place, and (3) by refusing to correct these errors, Facebook may have exposed itself to liability for defamation.\n\nClaim #2 is a judgement call, and I cannot say whether it's correct. Maybe giving ideological groups fact-checking powers was not a good move for Facebook. I won't tackle that topic here.\n\nHowever, claims 1 and 3 collapse if The Weekly Standard's fact-checkers made the right call regarding the \"false\" article. Let's take a look.\n\nAgain, the headline is \"Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed.\" But Millhiser's article makes a more nuanced argument. As he summarizes it in the follow-up post:\n\nKavanaugh cited in his confirmation hearing the \"Glucksberg test\" \u2014which refers to Washington v. Glucksberg, a 1997 Supreme Court decision establishing that the Constitution does not protect a right to physician-assisted suicide. Under Glucksberg, courts should determine which rights are protected by the Constitution by asking which rights are \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\" Kavanaugh also said in 2017 that \"even a first-year law student could tell you that the Glucksberg's approach to unenumerated rights was not consistent with the approach of the abortion cases such as Roe vs. Wade in 1973, as well as the 1992 decision reaffirming Roe, known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\" Our article also cited law professors Jim Oleske and Jamal Greene, both of whom reached similar conclusions regarding Kavanaugh's embrace of Glucksberg.\n\nDoes this information imply that Kavanaugh would be inclined to overturn Roe v. Wade? A reasonable person might infer that this is so. The article concludes with this statement: \"Judge Kavanaugh appears to be telegraphing his belief that Roe, Obergefell, and the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which provides that the government can not prosecute consenting adults for having sex, were not correctly decided.\"\n\nIf the headline had said that Kavanaugh had \"appeared to be telegraphing,\" or \"hinted at,\" or even \"heavily suggested\" he would kill Roe v. Wade, that would be one thing. But \"said\" is a strong word. It makes it sound like Kavanaugh directly stated his intention to kill Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn his follow-up, Millhiser concludes that this all hinges on the definition of the verb \"said.\" So he turns to the dictionary, which does indeed list \"indicate, show, and communicate\" as possible definitions for the word. However, \"said\" is generally used as a synonym for indicate, show, and communicate when the subject of the sentence is a thing that cannot use words. That look in your eyes can say a great deal, but not literally\u2014a \"look\" does not use words. People, on the other hand, do use words, so when writers describe a person as having said something, it's implied that they did so with their mouths.\n\nThis may seem like nitpicking, but we're in the midst of an intense news cycle revolving around the question of whether Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. A headline that straightforwardly claims he admitted he would do so is manipulating readers' expectations, and thus the claim should have been hedged in the headline\u2014even just a little bit\u2014as it was in the article. If the claim is The Weekly Standard was wrong to say this headline is false, then I rate this claim: Mostly false.",

    " Title: Senators Propose Federal Standards for Electric Grid Security Following California Substation Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a sniper attack on a California electrical substation last year, lawmakers are advocating for the imposition of federal standards to protect the nation's electric grid from potential attacks. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and her fellow senators plan to request the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish minimum security standards for critical substations.\n\nThe attack on Pacific Gas & Electric's Metcalf transmission substation on April 16, 2013, involved the severing of AT&T fiber-optic lines to disrupt phone and 911 service, and gunfire into a PG&E substation, causing outages. The incident, which had not been widely publicized until The Wall Street Journal's report on Wednesday, involved intruders lifting heavy manhole covers, climbing under the road, and cutting AT&T fiber-optic cables, temporarily disabling 911 and phone services. In a 19-minute period, gunmen fired more than 100 rounds into substation equipment, disabling 17 of 20 large transformers, causing approximately $16 million in damage. No arrests have been made in the case.\n\nDuring an oversight hearing in December, Representative Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) described the incident as an \"unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military-style weapons.\" He withheld details of the incident to avoid harming the investigation but added he had been in touch with the FBI about it.\n\nCongress is currently discussing a proposal that would grant the FERC the power to write and impose interim rules on grid defenses. The utility industry would still be able to influence any permanent requirements, according to The Wall Street Journal. Representative Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) stated, \"The last thing I want to do is regulate any industry,\" but added that utilities must do more to protect the grid for the sake of national security.\n\nUnder current law, the commission has to accept or reject proposals written by an industry-dominated group but cannot alter them, according to the report. Some utility industry executives told The Wall Street Journal it would be difficult to come up with rules for improving security that would work in both urban and rural areas. Lisa Barton, executive vice president of transmission for American Electric Power, stated, \"One size fits all may not get you true resiliency,\" adding that increasing protections could be costly. \"I'm not saying it is not worth it,\" she said.",

The meeting, though seemingly arranged quickly, was described by a White House official as a discussion regarding \"routine department business.\"\n\nRosenstein, who is Attorney General Jeff Sessions' deputy and was appointed by Trump, was spotted leaving the West Wing on Thursday afternoon. However, a White House official downplayed the meeting's significance, stating, \"Rod Rosenstein met with the president at the White House regarding routine department business.\"\n\nThe meeting came at a sensitive time for Rosenstein. Trump, outraged over the FBI's raid of personal lawyer Michael Cohen's office this week, has been publicly expressing his frustration with Rosenstein, Sessions, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's attack on Rosenstein is in reference to how the deputy attorney general signed a FISA surveillance warrant for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The president has repeatedly decried the Department of Justice and FBI's efforts to obtain that surveillance warrant.\n\nThe meeting between Rosenstein and Trump lasted about an hour, during which they discussed document production to Congress, according to Justice Department officials. Rosenstein was accompanied by FBI officials and also met with White House Counsel Don McGahn.\n\nSome Trump supporters have been urging him to remove Rosenstein. Former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova told Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Wednesday, \"Rod Rosenstein is so incompetent, compromised, and conflicted that he can no longer serve as the deputy attorney general.\"\n\nDespite this pressure, Trump, on Thursday, tweeted that he agrees with his legal team in cooperating with Mueller's probe. \"I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!),\" the president tweeted.\n\nOther supporters, including former adviser Stephen Bannon, have publicly encouraged Trump to stop cooperating with Mueller's requests. Earlier on Thursday, Trump denied seeking to shut down Mueller's Russia probe, stating, \"If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him.

As new hotspots of COVID-19 cases are reported in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah, some experts attribute the spike in part to increased testing, while others point to the recent reopening of businesses and public spaces in these areas.\n\nThe nationwide protests have also raised concerns about their potential role in the spread of the virus. However, it is currently too early to determine whether the protests will lead to a widespread outbreak, as the differences between outdoor and indoor exposure play a significant role in transmission. Outdoor protests may not pose as great a risk as indoor gatherings, and arrests and detainment in police vans or jail cells could potentially contribute to the spread of the virus more than the protests themselves.\n\nSome argue that the protests, which have been ongoing since the death of George Floyd, should not be encouraged or endorsed if they lead to a significant increase in COVID-19 infections and deaths. On the other hand, protesters are reportedly aware of the risk of transmission and are taking precautions to minimize it.\n\nPublic-health experts have adopted a harm-reduction approach to the protests, offering recommendations to help people protest as safely as possible. Some experts have gone further by providing masks and other protective gear on-site. The approach reflects the longstanding goal of public-health experts to maximize the health of the population across all aspects of life.\n\nExperts have emphasized that eternal lockdowns were not the only option for combating the pandemic. Once areas managed to get initial case spikes under control through widespread social distancing, a new phase of control should have been initiated with widespread testing and contact tracing. The initial lockdown period was intended to avoid the worst possible scenario, but the U.S. did not use that time to prepare for managing the pandemic in the future. As a result, the weeks that have passed since reopening have been wasted, according to some experts.\n\nJeff Shaman, an infectious disease modeler at Columbia University, stated, \"We managed to disrupt our economy [and] skyrocket unemployment, and we didn't control the damn virus.\"",
    " Title: House Immigration Reform Gains Momentum as Bipartisan Group Nears Bill Release\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives is set to delve deeper into immigration reform this week, aiming to catch up with the Senate on the primary domestic policy issue of the year. A bipartisan group in the House, which has been working on the issue for four years without releasing any proposals, is on the verge of producing a bill.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will hold its first immigration markup on Tuesday, focusing on an enforcement-centered bill that Democrats have expressed disapproval of. Meanwhile, the all-Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus will meet with Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Wednesday, with immigration being a key topic of discussion.\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), head of the CHC immigration task force, stated in an interview on Monday, \"He's the speaker of the House, the leader of the House and of the Republican Conference. He wants to get comprehensive immigration reform; we want to get comprehensive immigration reform passed. We should form a pact. Let's cement it this Wednesday.\"\n\nThe dual-track approach could signal actual momentum on House immigration reform, which has lagged significantly behind Senate efforts. The Senate is considering the bipartisan Gang of Eight bill on the floor and may vote on it before the July 4th recess.\n\nThe House group, now composed of three Republicans and four Democrats, appears poised to unveil its bill as early as Wednesday, although a later release in the week or early next week is more likely. Negotiators are still meeting for final touches and to review the language that has come back from the House legislative counsel.\n\nThe four Democratic negotiators\u2014Reps. Xavier Becerra and Zoe Lofgren of California, John Yarmuth of Kentucky, and Gutierrez\u2014will update all House Democrats at a caucus meeting on Tuesday. The group's Democratic members are also having smaller briefings with different members throughout the week, including meetings with the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus on Tuesday, and New Democrats and the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Wednesday.\n\nA Democratic aide noted, \"Democratic members are seeking input from their caucus on the bipartisan agreement the working group is drafting into legislative language. It's their hope that once all the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed, they will be able to introduce the measure with support from both sides of the aisle.\"\n\nHowever, the focus will be on the meeting between Boehner and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, believed to be the first time a Republican House speaker has met with the group, which is composed of all Democrats.",
    " Title: White House Warns of Potential $200 Billion Consumer Spending Drop in 2013 Due to Failed Middle-Class Tax Cut Extension\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has issued a warning to Republican lawmakers, stating that consumer spending could decrease by nearly $200 billion in 2013 if Congress fails to approve an extension of tax cuts for the middle class by the end of next month. The warning was accompanied by a report from the National Economic Council and the Council of Economic Advisers, which analyzed the impact on retailers if taxes increase on January 1 for families earning less than $250,000 per year.\n\nThe report suggests that allowing middle-class tax rates to rise and failing to pay for a short-term \"patch\" of the Alternative Minimum Tax could cut the growth of consumer spending by 1.7 percentage points in 2013. The White House believes that Democrats and Republicans should collaborate to renew middle-class tax cuts to provide economic certainty.\n\nThe Council of Economic Advisers estimates that consumers could spend nearly $200 billion less next year due to higher taxes, approximately four times the amount spent during the \"Black Friday\" weekend in 2011. The administration released the report on \"Cyber Monday,\" the busiest online shopping day of the year, to potentially build support for President Obama's position in negotiations with Congress to avoid the \"fiscal cliff,\" a mix of tax increases and automatic spending cuts set to take effect in January.\n\nThe administration's release of the report appears to be a calculated move to garner support for President Obama's position in negotiations with Congress to avert the fiscal cliff. Mr. Obama is urging lawmakers to first approve an extension of tax cuts for the middle class and to address tax rates for wealthier families later, which could result in an automatic tax increase on January 1 for households earning more than $250,000.\n\nIn a statement, the office of White House press secretary Jay Carney said, \"While the president is committed to working with Congress to reach compromises on areas of disagreement, there is no reason to delay acting where everyone agrees: extending tax cuts for the middle-class.\" Carney added, \"There is no reason to hold the middle-class hostage while we debate tax cuts for the highest income earners.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties have expressed optimism about reaching at least a temporary deal with the White House before the end of the year. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona said in a Sunday interview on CNN, \"I think it's likely that there will be a solution \u2014 not a final solution by any means, and not a big solution \u2014 but will get us through the end of the year into next year with a plan for trying to deal with these issues long-term over the course of the next Congress.\" Kyl added, \"That will require compromise.\"",
    " Title: Legal Uncertainty Surrounds Detention of U.S. Citizens as Enemy Combatants\n\nArticle:\n\nThe legality of detaining U.S. citizens arrested on domestic soil as enemy combatants remains unclear, despite the absence of known links between the recent Boston bombing suspect, Mr. Tsarnaev, and Al Qaeda. This issue has been a subject of debate among lawmakers, with some, like Senator Lindsey Graham, believing it to be lawful, while others disagree. Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has definitively resolved the question.\n\nDuring the Bush administration, the Supreme Court upheld the indefinite military detention of Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured carrying a weapon on the Afghanistan battlefield. However, the court never resolved the case of another American, Jose Padilla, who was held as an enemy combatant for several years after his arrest in Chicago. Two different federal appeals courts disagreed about the lawfulness of holding someone like Mr. Padilla in indefinite detention without trial, and the Bush administration transferred him back to the civilian court system before the Supreme Court took up the case.\n\nIn the Hamdi ruling, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote, \"There is no bar to this nation\u2019s holding one of its own citizens as an enemy combatant.\" However, she also limited the decision to Mr. Hamdi's \"narrow circumstances\" and stated that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.\n\nSenator Graham suggested that the purpose of holding Mr. Tsarnaev as a military detainee would be to question him at length without a lawyer. The Obama administration has stated it would use a public-safety exception to the Miranda rule to question him for a period without informing him of his rights to remain silent and have a lawyer. However, Mr. Graham argued that this would at best gain only a few days before a lawyer intervened.\n\nMr. Graham also acknowledged that ultimately Mr. Tsarnaev must be transferred back to the civilian criminal justice system for prosecution, as the statute authorizing military commissions does not apply to U.S. citizens. Mr. Graham, one of the leading Republican voices opposing the torture of terrorism suspects, emphasized that interrogation as an enemy combatant would not involve inflicting suffering on Mr. Tsarnaev to make him talk, and that anything he said in military detention should not be used as courtroom evidence.\n\nHowever, Mr. Graham rejected the view that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might be equally or more effective than intelligence officials at persuading Mr. Tsarnaev to provide information, even with a defense lawyer at his side. He argued that law enforcement officials would disrupt the dynamic of building a rapport with a prisoner by their presence. \"That is, to me, the dumbest way to induce someone to talk,\" he said of such tools and tactics of law enforcement officials. \"I want intelligence officials trained in the intelligence process to have a chance to talk to him, without a lawyer.\"",
    " Title: Biden Rallies in Detroit Ahead of Michigan Presidential Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden held a rally in Detroit on Monday, seeking votes, volunteers, and campaign contributions ahead of Michigan's presidential primary. Addressing a crowd of approximately 1,000 people at Renaissance High School, Biden emphasized the importance of Michigan in the upcoming November election, stating, \"Michigan, I\u2019m counting on you in a big way.\"\n\nBiden, who has garnered significant support from the African American community, was joined at the rally by U.S. Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The event took place in a city where 82% of residents are African American.\n\nSenator Cory Booker spoke at the rally, expressing support for Biden, stating, \"And there is one man who is ready to go to the center of the arena, who has the best shot to beat Donald Trump, the best one to heal the soul of America and bring dignity back to the office. And that person is one person, Joe Biden.\"\n\nProtesters carrying Green New Deal signs disrupted the rally, chanting, \"Joe has to go.\" They were escorted out of the gymnasium. Biden responded, \"The Bernie Bros are here,\" telling security to let the protesters leave peacefully.\n\nLt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who is supporting Biden, received some boos from the crowd when he took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.\n\nBiden emphasized the importance of the election, stating, \"This election isn\u2019t about a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party, it\u2019s a battle for the soul of America.\" He also reminded the crowd of the $2.5 billion investment the Obama administration made to help restore the Great Lakes.\n\nBefore the rally, Biden attended a $1,000-per-person fundraiser at the Detroit Athletic Club, hosted by some of Michigan's biggest political names, including former Gov. Jim Blanchard, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, and Detroit businessman Dennis Archer Jr.\n\nBiden's rally at Renaissance High School was the biggest event of the day. It featured a raucous crowd that cheered throughout, a marching band, and signs emblazoned with \"Joementum\" and \"Michiganders love Biden!\"\n\nDespite Biden's late arrival in the state and minimal organization on the ground, his numbers soared in several polls released on Monday. In a poll of 400 Michigan voters done by the Lansing polling firm EPIC/MRA last week for the Free Press, Biden had opened up a 24-point lead over Sanders, gaining a 51%-27% margin in the final days before Tuesday's presidential primary election.\n\nHowever, Sanders was in the same position in 2016, down by 26 points to rival Hillary Clinton before the primary and ended up pulling out a narrow victory.\n\nIn Grand Rapids, Biden spoke at the Cherry Health Heart of the City Community Health Center to a small audience of media and Cherry Health officials, discussing the expansion of community health centers across the country due to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Biden stated that he hopes to build on that in the White House.",
    " Title: Media Trust and the Trump Presidency: A Look at the Challenges Facing the News Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States has presented a unique challenge for the media, an industry grappling with declining trust and revenue. According to a Gallup poll in September 2016, only 14% of Americans have \"a great deal\" of trust in the news media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly. Combining this with the 18% who have \"a fair amount\" of trust, only a third of the country's trust is in the news media.\n\nThe media's treatment of President Trump during the campaign is believed to be a significant factor in this distrust, particularly among his 63 million voters. The media's coverage of Trump was often criticized as mean and petty, in contrast to the celebratory coverage given to President Barack Obama in 2008, the first black president.\n\nInstead of seizing the opportunity to rebuild trust with disenchanted readers and viewers, major media outlets have continued to antagonize Trump's supporters. For instance, a week after Trump's election, The New York Times led a chorus of news outlets reporting chaos in the Trump transition team. However, the transition went smoothly, and Trump appointed a competent Cabinet from Day One.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Times itself has faced internal challenges, with layoffs and plans to rent out parts of its building to offset ad revenue losses. This is just one example of the lost opportunities to reach out to disenchanted readers and viewers.\n\nThe media is based in liberal strongholds such as Washington, New York, and Los Angeles, and is staffed by people who either never lived in the nation's interior or who left due to dislike for their hometowns. Last summer, the Columbia Journalism Review published a column urging reporters to abandon the pretense of objectivity to stop Trump.\n\nIn the 2016 election, 243 newspapers endorsed Hillary Clinton, while 20 endorsed Trump. If newspapers had any significant influence, it would have been a 50-state shutout for Clinton. Instead, it was a 30-state sweep for Trump.\n\nRather than offering constructive advice for restoring the media's integrity, the Columbia Journalism Review's editor, Kyle Pope, urged the media to double down on their approach. Pope published an open letter to the president on January 17, protesting Trump's plan to treat the media poorly in his presidency, similar to the media's treatment of him during the election.\n\nInstead of offering sober advice to an industry in need of adult guidance, Pope played to the crowd of reporters who believe they have constitutional license to treat a duly elected president like a second-class citizen. Pope's approach may have been popular among anti-Trump reporters, but it has not helped the media's financial situation, with layoffs and office space rentals becoming common.\n\nDon Surber, a retired newsman who lives in Poca, West Virginia, and is the author of \"Trump the Press,\" which covered the 2016 Republican nomination process, offers a different perspective. In February, he will publish \"Trump the Establishment,\" which covers the general election. Surber suggests that the media should knock off the anti-Trump tweets, stop looking for trouble where there is none, and start playing the game straight. Until news organizations do, they will continue to face financial challenges.",
    " Title: White House Hosts Social Media Summit for Conservative Personalities, Discusses Free Speech Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump convened a meeting with prominent conservative social media figures at the White House on Thursday, expressing concerns about alleged suppression of conservative voices by big tech firms. Trump stated that his administration is exploring regulations and legislation to protect free speech, though specific measures were not detailed. He also announced plans to summon major social media companies to the White House for discussions in the coming weeks.\n\nDuring the event, Trump criticized big tech firms for allegedly censoring conservative voices, stating, \"We\u2019re not going to be silenced.\" He also mentioned fluctuations in his own Twitter followers as a concern. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution enshrines freedom of speech.\n\nTrump, who frequently criticizes mainstream media for what he terms \"fake news,\" has made social media a key component of his political campaigns. However, he and other Republicans have long claimed that online platforms employ tactics to silence conservative voices, allegations that major social media companies have denied.\n\nThe gathering in the East Room included several members of Trump\u2019s cabinet and White House team, as well as his son Donald Trump Jr., along with dozens of pro-Trump online personalities. Among those called to the stage were Lila Rose, an anti-abortion activist who has been blocked from Pinterest; California lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, who has represented conservatives in free-speech lawsuits; and Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as Diamond and Silk.\n\nCarpe Donktum, a pro-Trump online persona who was recently suspended by Twitter for eight days over a video depicting Trump as a cowboy attacking CNN journalist Jim Acosta, commented that the face-to-face event could unite online conservatives.\n\nIn freewheeling remarks, Trump discussed the power of social media and criticized traditional media, which stood at the back of the room. He stated, \"We hardly do press releases anymore. If I put it out on social media, it\u2019s like an explosion.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged criticism about the online behavior of some conservative users of social media, saying, \"Some of you guys are out there - but even you should have a voice.\" He also commented on the content created by some conservative users, stating, \"The crap you think of is unbelievable - it\u2019s genius, but it\u2019s bad.\"\n\nIn the past, Trump has threatened retaliatory action related to free speech. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges and universities to maintain \"free speech\" on campus if they want to continue receiving federal research funds. Last September, he suggested that the license of television network NBC could be challenged over its news reporting.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat, criticized the meeting, stating, \"Instead of focusing on combating Russian social media misinformation, punishing anti-competitive practices, or protecting Americans\u2019 data and privacy, the president has invited trolls, conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites, and the whole comments section to the White House.\"\n\nTrump suggested that he might invite some of the conservative social media users back to the White House for the meeting with major social media firms. Three tech officials stated they had no knowledge of the meeting before Trump announced it.\n\nFacebook Inc, Twitter Inc, and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google declined to comment on Trump\u2019s announcement that he would bring them to the White House for a meeting. The Internet Association, a trade group representing major tech firms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, stated, \"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress have held numerous hearings on the issue of alleged conservative bias on social media outlets. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who is working on proposed legislation on the issue, took the stage briefly on Thursday to air his complaints. \"They\u2019ve gotten rich off of their special privileges from government. They want to keep those, they shouldn\u2019t discriminate. They shouldn\u2019t censor,\" Hawley said.\n\nA Senate panel chaired by Republican Ted Cruz is scheduled to hold a hearing titled \"Google and Censorship through Search Engines\" featuring Google\u2019s vice president of public policy, Karan Bhatia, on Tuesday.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Approval Ratings Drop Amidst Polarizing Reactions in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, during his first visit to the United States this month, has seen a decline in approval ratings, according to Gallup, from 76% in 2014 to 59% currently. The Pope's message of compassion, care for the planet, and rejection of opulent living has elicited a range of emotions, including love, admiration, scorn, and fear.\n\nAn article titled \"Why so Many People Think Pope Francis is the Antichrist\" appeared on Charisma News, reflecting the conflicting sentiments towards the Pope. In response, various conspiracy theories have emerged, such as the claim that a Jesuit priest predicted Pope Benedict's resignation and that Pope Francis could be \"demonically inspired.\"\n\nThe decline in approval ratings is attributed to the discomfort that many Americans feel due to Pope Francis' challenging their beliefs and values. Sister Donna Markham, the president of Catholic Charities, stated, \"He's nudging me, as he is lots of us, to think about some uncomfortable things and how we might be better human beings in our world today, and that's hard.\"\n\nPope Francis' criticism of unfettered capitalism and his emphasis on caring for the poor has been met with resistance, particularly by conservatives who view him as a Marxist promoting wealth redistribution. R. Albert Mohler Jr., the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, described the Pope's words as dangerous and a source of division within Roman Catholicism.\n\nOn the other hand, Pope Francis' stance on moral issues, such as climate change, immigration, and the treatment of the poor, resonates with progressives. However, his opposition to same-sex marriage, women priests, married priests, divorce, birth control, and abortion remains a source of contention.\n\nThe Rev. Thomas Bohlin, vicar of Opus Dei, suggested that Pope Francis is not intending to change any doctrine but rather to shift the emphasis and the way people perceive religion.\n\nPope Francis' ability to evoke strong, often conflicting, reactions may stem from his refusal to be easily categorized and his emphasis on personal introspection and responsibility rather than personal gain. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio noted, \"I don't think he thinks about his work in terms of favorability. I think he thinks about telling the truth.\"",
    " Title: Suspect in Pennsylvania State Trooper Ambush Captured After 48-Day Manhunt\n\nArticle:\n\nAfter a 48-day manhunt in northeast Pennsylvania, authorities apprehended 31-year-old Eric Frein, the suspect in the sniper ambush attack that resulted in the death of a state trooper and the injury of another on Sept. 12. The capture occurred at an abandoned Poconos airplane hangar, where Frein had reportedly been hiding.\n\nFrein, who had evaded capture in the thick, cave-strewn Pocono Mountain woods, was spotted late Thursday by a team of U.S. marshals assisting in the manhunt. He surrendered quietly, providing his name to the authorities. Police noted that Frein was clean-shaven and in better health than expected, with a cut on his nose that was not caused by police. There were conflicting reports about whether Frein was armed at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe capture took place at the Birchwood Pocono Air Park in Tannersville, Pa., approximately 30 miles from Blooming Grove, where the shootings occurred. Frein was transported to the Pike County Correctional Facility from the barracks early Friday morning. He is scheduled to appear in court at 9 a.m. this morning.\n\nTroopers used the handcuffs of the slain officer, Cpl. Bryon Dickson, to manacle Frein. Police also used Dickson's cruiser to transport Frein to a cell at the Blooming Grove barracks, the same police safehouse he attacked near midnight on Sept. 12 before disappearing into the deep woods.\n\nProsecutors plan to seek the death penalty amid a litany of murder and bomb-making charges. However, Frein's motives remain elusive, with police only describing his alleged actions as \"pure evil.\" Frein was a standout on his high school rifle team, and his father, an Army officer, had said Frein \"doesn't miss.\" He had been jailed for 109 days in the mid-2000s for larceny stemming from a war-reenactment festival in New York.\n\nPolice believe Frein had planned the attack and escape for years. They found hints that he had researched information about evading police online. For 48 days, he managed to stay just ahead of the manhunt, partly due to the extreme caution exhibited by searchers.\n\nSome civilian tracking experts noted that police manhunt methods had fallen short, and officials acknowledged that the combination of thick geography and concerns about another sniper attack on searchers had slowed the manhunt down. The surrounding hill communities expressed concerns about Frein's ability to cause further harm even as residents complained about area lockdowns and school closings.\n\nThe manhunt atmosphere created a sort of police state, according to Scranton, Pa., Times-Tribune columnist Chris Kelly, raising important questions about law enforcement's authority to curtail the rights of innocent citizens. The shooting and manhunt occurred in a year of anti-police protests in New York City and Ferguson, Mo., over cases where unarmed black men were killed by white police officers. Police fraternal organizations have been warning in recent years of an uptick in ambush assaults on law enforcement and courts.\n\nFrein had become a ghostly presence in the quiet Pennsylvania township where he grew up. When police had sighted him, he would disappear into the thicket. Some speculated that Frein perhaps was \"on a beach somewhere.\" Police, however, never considered ending the manhunt, which was estimated to be costing more than $1 million per week. After Frein's capture, local officials also made sure to inform everyone that Halloween was no longer canceled.",
    " Title: President Trump Refuses to Discuss Police Violence Against Black People, Defends Confederate Flag\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In an interview with CBS's Catherine Herridge on Tuesday, President Donald Trump refused to answer a question about police violence against Black people, instead pointing out that white people are also victims of police violence.\n\nWhen asked why Black Americans are still dying at the hands of law enforcement, Trump responded, \"And so are white people, so are white people.\" He continued, \"What a terrible question to ask. So are white people, more white people by the way, more white people.\"\n\nAccording to a Washington Post database tracking fatal police shootings in the United States, white people make up roughly half of the people shot and killed annually by police. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that roughly 76 percent of the country is white while only 13 percent is Black. The Washington Post database shows that the rate at which Black people are shot and killed by law enforcement is twice as high as that of white people.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump also defended the Confederate flag, stating, \"It's freedom of speech.\" When asked if he would be comfortable with his supporters displaying the Confederate flag at political events, Trump said, \"I'm comfortable with freedom of speech.\"\n\nNASCAR announced in June it would ban Confederate flags from its events after Darrell \"Bubba\" Wallace Jr., the only black driver in the racing association's top series, called for change in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd.\n\nTrump has been criticized for his insistence on protecting monuments that honor Confederate leaders who fought to protect slavery and uphold white supremacy. Trump went as far as to threaten to veto Congress's annual defense authorization bill if it contained language to rename U.S. military bases honoring Confederate commanders, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Benning in Georgia, and Fort Hood in Texas.\n\nTrump signed an executive order at the end of June to protect federal monuments after statues memorializing the Confederacy and some of the nation's Founding Fathers were vandalized.",
    " Title: Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin Questions Voter Fraud in Gubernatorial Election, Requests Recanvass\n\nArticle:\n\nKentucky Governor Matt Bevin expressed concerns about potential voter fraud in the state's gubernatorial election on Wednesday, as he trailed his Democratic challenger, Attorney General Andy Beshear, by approximately 5,000 votes in unofficial results. Bevin requested a recanvass of the results in his race against Beshear, who claimed victory.\n\nBevin alleged irregularities in the election, citing \"thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted,\" voters being \"incorrectly turned away,\" and malfunctioning voting machines, according to Politico. He also stated that his team was gathering affidavits and other information to better understand the election's outcome.\n\nThe recanvass, a check of the vote count to ensure the results were added correctly, is scheduled for next Thursday. Kentucky does not have a mandatory recount law, so if Bevin decides to pursue a recount, he would need a court's approval.\n\nThe gubernatorial race was part of a strong night for Republicans in Kentucky, with GOP candidates winning races for state attorney general, secretary of state, auditor, agriculture commissioner, and treasurer. The nearly clean sweep by Republican candidates for Kentucky's top jobs followed President Trump's Monday night rally on their behalf.\n\nBevin's refusal to concede defeat has not been met with universal agreement among Kentucky Republicans. State Representative Jason Nemes wrote on social media, \"Governor-elect Beshear is entitled to the democratic legitimacy that comes with loser's consent. So let's go through the process honorably and expeditiously and give it to him.\" Republican strategist Scott Jennings referred to Beshear as Kentucky's next governor, wishing him \"godspeed\" and saying he \"ran a good race.\"\n\nPresident Trump, in a Twitter message Wednesday, focused on his role in the Kentucky elections, stating, \"Our big Kentucky Rally on Monday night had a massive impact on all of the races. The increase in Governors race was at least 15 points, and maybe 20!\" Turnout in Kentucky was up by nearly 50 percent over the state's 2015 governor's race, increasing from 974,000 voters to more than 1.4 million. The number of voters Tuesday equaled turnout in Kentucky's 2014 race for U.S. Senate, rare for an election in an odd-numbered year.",
    " Title: North Carolina Passes Voter ID Law, Joining 10 Other States in Requiring Voter Identification\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican-dominated North Carolina House approved a measure on Thursday night that requires residents to present photo identification to vote, joining 10 other states that have similar laws in place. The measure, which passed the state's Senate a day earlier, aims to prevent voter fraud, according to Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger.\n\nIn the past two years, at least 11 states have approved laws requiring voters to show identification at voting booths. However, critics argue that the measure is an attempt to disenfranchise poor, minority, and disabled voters.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina stated that the measure \"attacks democracy at its core\" by making it harder for eligible voters to cast their ballots. The group cited provisions such as eliminating pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds, and disallowing the use of college IDs at the polls as particularly burdensome for young and elderly voters.\n\nProponents of the bill argue that having a valid, government-issued photo identification is a reasonable, modern-day necessity to ensure voter integrity. A poll this year showed that more than 72% of North Carolina residents support requiring voters to show photo ID before casting their ballot, according to Berger.\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court voted to halt the enforcement requirements of the Voting Rights Act, which had required some states with a history of voter discrimination to get \"precleared\" by the federal government before making any changes to voting laws. North Carolina was among those states. The high court's ruling essentially allows states to make adjustments to voting laws without \"preclearance\" from the federal government.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder expressed displeasure with last month's change in the Voting Rights Act. \"For nearly five decades, preclearance served as a potent tool for addressing inequities in our election systems,\" he said. \"Although preclearance originated during the Civil Rights Movement -- and was informed by a history of discrimination -- the conduct that it was intended to address continues to this day.\"\n\nHolder said he has directed the Justice Department to ask a Texas federal court to subject the state to a condition similar to preclearance rights. He stated that there is evidence of racial discrimination in the state, and thus it should be forced to go through a federal preapproval before implementing voting changes.\n\nStates that may wish to implement their voter ID laws may still face another hurdle, as civil rights groups and even the federal government could seek legal action to block the laws under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, another part of the law that works to prevent discrimination.",
    " Title: Court Decision on Bridgegate Scandal: Federal Law Does Not Criminalize Partisan Use of Government Authority\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled that the actions taken in the Bridgegate scandal, in which New Jersey officials realigned toll lanes for political purposes, do not constitute a federal crime under current law. The officials did not obtain any money or property, but instead used their governmental authority for corrupt and fraudulent reasons to make life difficult for the constituents of their political opponent.\n\nThe Court's decision is not unprecedented, as it has previously vacated the conviction of a former Virginia governor who exchanged access to meetings for political donations. In both cases, the Court has expressed concerns about the potential for prosecution over ordinary, if untoward, government conduct.\n\nThe Court's rulings in these cases have concluded that federal criminal law does not currently prohibit the defendants' conduct. It remains unclear whether Congress could pass a law criminalizing such behavior, as the Court has expressed significant constitutional concerns with the federal government's attempts to prosecute government officials for taking bribes.\n\nThe Court's conservative justices have also invalidated several statutes designed to combat public corruption, citing that money in politics is a common aspect of government and potentially enshrined in the Constitution. The Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and McCutcheon v. FEC cases are examples of this, as the Court dismissed the idea that large campaign expenditures give rise to the appearance of corruption.\n\nThe Court's decision on the Bridgegate scandal comes at a time of very public government corruption during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent examples include the president's claims that he instructed Vice President Mike Pence not to return the calls of unappreciative governors, and that he sent ventilators to Colorado because of Republican Senator Cory Gardner. The Democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has alleged that the federal government has encouraged businesses not to provide any support to the state. The president, Senator Mitch McConnell, and the Department of Justice have openly acknowledged that their views on coronavirus-relief packages are based on the political affiliation of the states in need.",
    " Title: Unusual Coalition: Democrats and Tea Party Activists Align Against McConnell in Kentucky Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected move, Democrats and Tea Party activists in Kentucky are reportedly collaborating to potentially oust Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2014 GOP primary. The goal is to soften McConnell's position in a general election, where Democrats still hold a voter registration advantage, or to nominate a weak candidate who may lose in the general election.\n\nKeith Rouda, a field organizer with the liberal group MoveOn and the Democratic super PAC, Progress Kentucky, stated, \"We are doing a lot of reaching out to some of the tea party folks across the state. What we\u2019re finding \u2014 at least in this stage of the race \u2014 we\u2019re finding that our interests align. It\u2019s unusual.\"\n\nProgress Kentucky has begun circulating petitions urging Republicans to enter the race, and Democratic donors active in Kentucky and national politics are reportedly willing to provide financial support to a Tea Party candidate. However, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Kentucky Democratic Party are not currently involved in these efforts, according to officials.\n\nSarah Durand, president of the Louisville Tea Party, said Democratic donors and activists have expressed a willingness to spend seven figures in a GOP primary to support a candidate challenging McConnell. The challenge for Tea Party groups, Durand said, is to recruit a candidate who wouldn't hand the seat to the Democrats, despite widespread dissatisfaction among Tea Party leaders with McConnell's three-decade tenure in Washington.\n\nDurand expressed concern about the potential outcome of a primary challenge, citing the example of former Senator Dick Lugar, who was defeated in the 2012 primary and subsequently lost the seat to a Democrat. \"I guess the fear would be ending up in the Dick Lugar situation where you oust the incumbent and end up with a Democrat,\" Durand said. \"But I really think if Sen. McConnell can\u2019t garner some enthusiasm within the tea party, which is going to be very difficult at this point, then he\u2019s going to have a really tough road ahead in this election cycle.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, McConnell and his campaign staff are reportedly taking steps to counter any primary challenge. McConnell's staff has attended over 100 Tea Party meetings in the state over the past two years, and the leader himself has spoken at three Tea Party rallies, including one with Senator Rand Paul in the state capital of Frankfort last August.\n\nMcConnell has also held face-to-face meetings with several Tea Party activists, including Durand and her fellow activists, and has been quick to bring under his wing the two biggest forces in Tea Party politics in the state: Paul and freshman Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who was initially seen as a potential primary threat to McConnell.",
    " Title: World Leaders Gather in Manhattan as Climate Change Debate Persists\n\nArticle:\n\nWorld leaders have gathered in Manhattan for a meeting, with the Tuesday weather forecast predicting sunny skies and temperatures in the 70s. During the meeting, President Obama expressed concerns about climate extremes and urged world leaders to address the issue. However, the success of his appeal remains uncertain.\n\nThe debate over climate change has been a contentious issue, with some arguing for carbon sacrifices to combat global warming, while others maintain that giving up affordable energy sources that emit carbon dioxide hinders prosperity. European nations, in particular, have been criticized for their inconsistent approach to global warming, with some nations advocating for action while others have been labeled as fair-weather global warmists.\n\nThe debate over climate change has been a recurring theme in movies and television shows, but its prominence has waned in recent years. According to historian Benjamin Schmidt of Northeastern University, mentions of climate change in films and television shows have decreased significantly since 2006, with such mentions often appearing as jokes or in animated shows.\n\nDespite the ongoing debate, some argue that the planet's ice levels are in balance, and the oceans are not rising. This perspective challenges the widely held belief that human activities are causing the Earth's climate to change dramatically.\n\nCritics of the climate change narrative argue that the Earth is a resilient planet that has survived various natural disasters throughout history. They question the assumption that a few extra emissions of carbon dioxide, a substance that promotes plant growth, could throw the planet out of balance.\n\nThe meeting in Manhattan is expected to continue, with world leaders discussing various strategies to address climate change. However, the success of these discussions remains uncertain, and the debate over climate change is likely to continue.",
    " Title: Congress Urged to Limit Executive Authority in Cuba Policy Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's decision to establish diplomatic ties with Cuba has sparked debate in the U.S. Congress, with lawmakers expressing concerns over the potential implications of the move. The release of American hostage Alan Gross, who was imprisoned in Cuba for five years, is welcomed, but the exchange of three Cuban spies for Gross is criticized for establishing a moral and legal equivalency, as the spies were convicted for actions leading to the death of an American in the 1990s.\n\nThe U.S. Congress asserts that President Obama lacks the authority to lift the embargo on Cuba, allow trade, let tourists to visit, or grant Cuba access to capital markets. The Helms-Burton Act of 1996 grants Congress the power to override any executive action to lift the embargo.\n\nTo lift the embargo, the Cuban government would need to grant the Cuban people rights such as association, speech, and political activity, which President Obama reportedly failed to secure in his conversation with Cuban dictator Raul Castro. Congress can also set statutory criteria that must be met before the administration can remove Cuba from the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nSenators have threatened to place a hold on any ambassador nominated to serve in Cuba unless the Cuban government is no longer a threat to the U.S. and has decided to grant freedom to its people. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has already stated his intention to do so.\n\nCongress is also considering using policy riders in the upcoming DHS appropriations debate in February and the Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations process to deny the president funds for setting up relations.\n\nCritics argue that President Obama's approach to Cuba has been feckless, with little to show for substantial concessions made to the Communist regime. After five years of negotiations, President Obama ended exactly where Raul Castro's demands began. Senator Marco Rubio described President Obama as the worst negotiator since Carter.\n\nPresident Obama's statement was filled with communist talking points, such as the claim that Cubans are poor and unfree due to the embargo, or that Cuba was a U.S. colony. These claims are disputed, and yet President Obama made them.\n\nCongress is urged to act to limit the potential damage of the Cuba policy changes, as critics argue that President Obama may move on to the next item on his policy agenda without making substantial concessions from the Cuban government.",
    " Title: Trump Calls for Muslim Nations to Combat Extremism in Historic Speech in Riyadh\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic speech on Sunday, President Donald Trump addressed leaders from across the Middle East and North Africa, urging them to take the lead in eradicating extremist Islam within their own countries. The speech, delivered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, marked the beginning of the president's first foreign trip as the head of state.\n\nTrump vowed that the United States would be a strong partner in the fight against terrorism but emphasized that Muslim nations must take the lead by promoting religious tolerance and rooting out extremists, even from within mosques and religious schools.\n\n\"There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it. No accepting it. No excusing it and no ignoring it,\" the president said. He described the ongoing battle as a struggle between good and evil, stating, \"Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God.\"\n\nThe president also called for a unified front to combat and isolate Iran, a common enemy of many in the room. Trump's speech represented a significant departure from the anti-terror and foreign policy of the Obama administration, which was criticized by many Muslim countries for the Iran nuclear deal, which they saw as emboldening Tehran.\n\nThe speech provided a political win for Mr. Trump at home, as the media focus briefly shifted from accusations and investigations of collusion with Russia. However, Mr. Trump did not use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" a term he harshly criticized President Obama for not using during his presidency.\n\nDuring the campaign, when Mr. Trump often used rhetoric that risked offending Muslims, he stated that Mr. Obama would never be able to defeat an enemy he refused to name. Mr. Trump did refer to \"Islamists\" and \"Islamic terror,\" making clear the source of the extremism. But he stressed, as did Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush before him, that the United States was not at war with Islam.\n\n\"I stand before you as a representative of the American people to deliver a message of friendship and hope and love,\" he said. \"That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic faith.\"\n\nThe speech, which touched on sensitive topics for Muslims, appeared to be well-received. Mr. Trump garnered an early endorsement from Saudi King Salman, who introduced him with a plea for unity in the fight against extremism.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump's message was blunt and at times grim about the struggle against evil, the president delivered it with a tone of respect for the assembled leaders and optimism that they would prevail.\n\n\"We are not here to lecture. We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship,\" said the president. \"Instead, we are here to offer partnership\u2014based on shared interests and values\u2014to pursue a better future for us all.\"\n\nThe strategy Mr. Trump outlined included denying territory or safe havens for extremists and cutting off financial streams to groups associated with terrorism. He stressed that more than military action, a message of religious tolerance and anti-violence had to come from political and religious leaders in the Muslim world.\n\n\"It means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians,\" said Mr. Trump. \"Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory. Piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Heroes don't kill innocents; they save them.\"\n\nTurning words into action, Mr. Trump and King Salman agreed to establish the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center as a hub for efforts to counter terrorist fundraising.\n\nIn the United States, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich compared Mr. Trump's speech to President Reagan's famous Westminster address to the British Parliament that set the stage for the defeat of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"You have the president of the United States surrounded by the largest alliance we've ever seen in the Muslim world, talking and articulating about a practical and realistic idealism they are going to move forward together to create a better world,\" he said on Fox News. \"Just as Reagan set at a key moment in the defeat of the Soviet empire, Trump is now setting the key moment in the defeat of terrorism.\"",
    " Title: Major Cities Worldwide on High Alert Amid Terror Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of chilling terror threats, major cities in Europe and the United States have heightened their security measures. New York City and Brussels, in particular, are on high alert.\n\nNew York City conducted an extensive active-shooter drill, with a focus on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the city's first responders, stating, \"They're ready to protect us.\" In Brussels, the Belgian Prime Minister, Charles Michel, extended the highest alert level due to an \"imminent threat.\"\n\nIn Brussels, a major railway station was evacuated for a suspicious package on Sunday, but no explosives were found. The city experienced further security concerns in the tourist district, with streets being sealed off. Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon acknowledged the real threat, stating, \"There is a real threat, and we will make every effort day and night to face it.\"\n\nSeveral suspects linked to the November 13 Paris attacks are being sought in Belgium, with the manhunt focusing on Salah Abdeslam, a Belgian national who is believed to have fled Paris after the attacks. One of Abdeslam's brothers died in the attacks, and another brother made a plea on Belgian TV for Salah Abdeslam to surrender.\n\nIn jittery Paris, an explosion at the central Gare du Nord train station was found to be a bird electrocuted on the rails. French police also released a photo of a man they believe was one of three terrorists who died outside the national stadium during the November 13 attacks, seeking the public's help in identifying him.\n\nFrench authorities have decided to continue the detention of a man who had housed some of the attackers. Jawad Bendaoud admitted loaning his now infamous Saint-Denis apartment to the suspected ringleaders but has said he did not know his guests were avowed jihadists.\n\nRome and Milan were placed on alert after the foreign ministry warned that St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City along with some sites in Milan might be potential terror targets. In Los Angeles, a Southwest Airlines flight from Indianapolis arrived an hour late after making an unscheduled landing in Kansas City due to suspicious behavior. In Washington, D.C., Police Chief Cathy Lanier suggested residents should consider taking action, including shooting, if they find themselves in the midst of a terror attack.\n\nNo imminent, credible threat was reported for Washington or New York, but security was tight across both cities. U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes discussed New York City, stating, \"We don't know what we don't know. They've gotten very good at hiding from intelligence services across the world.\"",
    " Title: Senate Acquits President Trump in Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski announced on Monday that she will vote to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment this week, dashing hopes of Democrats who had anticipated the moderate Republican might join them in their effort to remove the president before the 2020 election.\n\nMurkowski, a senator from Alaska, criticized Mr. Trump for his behavior but also stated that the House had mishandled the case against him, making it impossible for him to receive a fair trial in the Senate. She expressed a preference for the House to have pursued censure instead.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, considered the most likely Democrat to side with Mr. Trump, stated on Monday that he had not yet decided how he will vote on Wednesday. However, he also expressed a desire for Congress to have tried censure, stating that the president's dealings with Ukraine were not \"perfect,\" as Mr. Trump has insisted.\n\nWith his acquittal looking increasingly likely, House Democrats made a last-ditch appeal to senators on Monday, arguing that the only way to constrain Mr. Trump is to vote to convict him on both articles of impeachment.\n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, the top impeachment prosecutor, said during the appeal that the president lacks character, has broken every boundary of decency, and has \"betrayed\" the country, subverting national security to his political whims.\n\nWith closing arguments now over, senators have two days to ponder their votes ahead of Wednesday afternoon's final action. The House voted to impeach Mr. Trump on December 18 on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe first article accuses the president of abuse of power stemming from a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Mr. Trump requested a corruption probe into a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and Democrats' activities in 2016, while withholding financial aid to Ukraine.\n\nA second article accuses the president of obstruction of Congress for claiming immunity from the House's probe and blocking witnesses and documents that Democrats sought. No Republicans voted for the articles in the House, marking the first time the impeachment of a president has happened on a purely partisan basis.\n\nThe president's allies have argued that Mr. Trump had the authority to request a probe into possible corruption, stating that Mr. Biden's son Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, receiving about $50,000 a month from Burisma, though he lacked expertise in the industry.\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Trump abused his position and that there is no basis to question the Bidens' behavior. During the House impeachment inquiry, Democrats picked the witnesses to be called and blocked the president's team from calling its own witnesses or cross-examining the Democrats' choices.\n\nNo witnesses testified that they heard the president condition aid on Ukraine investigating the Bidens, but several said they believed it to be the case based on circumstantial evidence. Democrats said those in the know, such as former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, rebuffed attempts to get them to appear.\n\nMr. Bolton has since said he would testify to the Senate and has written a book that reportedly says he was asked by the president to help facilitate a meeting between Ukrainian officials and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was allegedly part of the pressure campaign to start corruption investigations in Ukraine focused on the Bidens.\n\nSenators will have all day Tuesday to make remarks on the chamber floor about the impeachment proceedings, and will cast their final vote on whether to acquit Mr. Trump the following afternoon. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump will deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday night with the pending acquittal vote less than 24 hours away.\n\nDemocrats on Monday pivoted away from arguments over documents and witnesses and said the country's national security and fairness of the 2020 presidential election is at stake should Mr. Trump be left in office. \"Your duty demands you convict President Trump,\" said Representative Jason Crow, Colorado Democrat. \"In America, no one is above the law\u2014even those elected president of the United States.\"\n\nMr. Schiff said there is a \"100%\" chance the president will \"continue trying to cheat in the election until he succeeds.\" The impeachment charges arose after a whistleblower complaint surfaced in August about Mr. Trump's July phone call with Mr. Zelensky, asserting there was a quid pro quo in requesting the corruption probe while withholding the military aid.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections Shift Focus: Foreign Policy and Islamic State Threat Overshadow Domestic Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2014 midterm elections have experienced a significant shift in focus, with the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) causing both Democrats and Republicans to emphasize their hawkish stance on national security and terrorism. The focus on foreign policy issues has temporarily overshadowed the partisan sparring over ObamaCare and multiple scandals that have dominated headlines and threatened to define the Obama administration.\n\nWith just nine weeks remaining before voters decide the makeup of the next Congress, ISIS, Ukraine, Gaza, and Boko Haram have replaced the IRS, Benghazi, NSA data-gathering, and the VA on the lips of candidates and the minds of voters. The result is a race that looks much different than the last off-year midterm cycle.\n\nFour years ago, Fox News polled voters on their top issues at the ballot box, with the economy at the top and Iraq at the bottom. While the economy still matters, recent polling shows voters want a tougher approach to foreign policy as ISIS militants wreak havoc in northern Iraq and Syria and threaten western interests.\n\nCandidates are responding to this demand. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who faces a Republican challenge from former GOP chairman Ed Gillespie in November, on Wednesday urged the Obama administration to present a \"clear strategy\" for \"eliminating\" the Islamic State threat.\n\n\"The United States should not take any military options off the table, because stopping ISIL is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. and our European allies,\" Warner said in a statement.\n\nThe sudden focus on foreign policy poses a challenge for both parties. Republicans, who have been pulled in an isolationist direction by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and budget-minded Tea Party groups, are adjusting their tone. Even Paul, while saying President Obama must make his case for military action to Congress, told Fox News on Wednesday that the terror group has \"absolutely\" declared war on America.\n\nFor Democrats, the focus on the Middle East allows candidates to, at least briefly, get off the defensive on ObamaCare and administration controversies ranging from Benghazi to IRS targeting. However, the furor over terror threats means there's less room for Democratic candidates to tout modest domestic gains like job creation or the rebound of the stock market. And new polls show that the president suffers in public opinion on foreign affairs, leaving Democrats once again putting distance between themselves and the commander-in-chief.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who's in a race against former GOP Sen. Scott Brown, did exactly that when she issued a Twitter rebuke of the president on Wednesday after he said the goal is to make the terror group \"manageable.\"\n\n\"Do not believe ISIL is'manageable,' agree these terrorists must be chased to the 'gates of hell,'\" she tweeted. The comment was a reference to Vice President Biden's vow, at an event with Shaheen, to pursue the militants \"to the gates of Hell.\"\n\nLara Brown, associate professor of political management with George Washington University, said the economy\u2014and the \"languishing recovery\"\u2014likely will remain a top issue in the fall. However, she described voter perceptions of Obama's leadership abroad as a factor.\n\n\"I think that puts Democrats, especially those that are more moderate...in a more difficult position, because they need the president to take a strong stand so they can say they are standing behind the president,\" she said.\n\nBrown said the president could still \"get back on top\" of the narrative. \"To a certain extent, the jury's out on where we are on this,\" she said.\n\nA fresh GWU poll underscored the president's vulnerability on the subject. The poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken Aug. 24-28, showed 58 percent disapprove of his handling of foreign affairs. A Pew Research Center and USA Today survey also showed 54 percent see Obama as \"not tough enough\" on security issues. That's a turnaround from when Obama ran in 2012 in part on the successful mission to take out Usama bin Laden.\n\nThe same Pew poll showed dramatically changing attitudes toward America's role in the world, after years where fatigue from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars appeared to be setting in. The share of Americans who now say the U.S. does \"too little\" to address world problems roughly doubled since November 2013, to 31 percent. The share who say the opposite fell sharply, from 51 to 39 percent. The survey of 1,501 adults was taken Aug. 20-24.\n\nAs Democrats try and toughen their tone, Republicans are doing the same\u2014and going after the president for a strategy they say is in shambles. Brown, Shaheen's opponent, said this week that America's enemies have been \"emboldened by the Obama administration's incoherent foreign policy.\"\n\nBrown released a scathing web video juxtaposing Biden's 2012 claims about Obama's \"strength\" with ominous footage of Islamic militants and the president's recent gaffe where he said \"we do not have a strategy\" yet to address ISIS in Syria. The ad ends with the text \"Obama Biden\u2014a foreign policy failure.\"",
    " Title: Analysis of Key Senate Races in the 2018 Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Waage, political analyst for \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, has analyzed the poll numbers for the upcoming midterm elections, focusing on the key Senate races that could determine control of the Senate. Democrats need to win two seats to take control, but they face an uphill battle due to the need to hold on to six states where they are facing tough challenges from Republicans.\n\nThe Kavanaugh confirmation battle may have an impact on some of these races. The fight over Kavanaugh's nomination, due process issues, and the concept of innocent until proven guilty has reportedly made a difference in the polls, according to Waage.\n\nIn North Dakota, incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D), who voted against Kavanaugh, is down double digits against challenger Kevin Cramer (R). In Missouri, Josh Hawley (R) has been targeting the Kavanaugh treatment, and he is giving incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) a tough fight. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester (D) is the incumbent facing Matt Rosendale (R), and that race is nearly a dead heat.\n\nIn West Virginia, incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D), who voted for Kavanaugh, is holding onto the lead there in the aftermath of that vote. The Republicans are defending seats in Arizona and Tennessee, where Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Bob Corker are retiring from their seats. In Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn (R) now has a 14-point edge against Phil Bredesen (D) in the latest New York Times poll, even after pop singer Taylor Swift came out against Blackburn. In Arizona, Martha McSally (R) is facing Kyrsten Sinema (D) and has pulled up to a tie or is even a little ahead.\n\nIn Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz (R) has increased his margin over Beto O'Rourke (D). However, Democrats have pumped millions of dollars into that fight, and O'Rourke has much more campaign funding than Cruz. Democrats are also hoping to take away the Republican-held seat in Nevada, where Jacky Rosen (D) is facing incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R), but Heller has a slight lead in recent polls there.\n\nWaage predicts that based on the current polls, Republicans would gain two Senate seats if the election happened today. The possibility of a House takeover is more likely for Democrats than a Senate takeover, but it all comes down to voter turnout. Waage believes that even if Democrats win control of the House, it will be by a very slim margin. \"Both bases are mobilized,\" he says, \"Republicans weren't before the Kavanaugh hearings, but they are now.\"",
    " Title: Senate Clears Path for Immigration Bill, but House Outcome Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan immigration bill that offers a 13-year path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States has cleared a significant legislative hurdle in the Senate. The bill, which addresses a highly charged issue with significant political implications for both parties, received a strong majority vote on Tuesday, with 82 senators in favor and 15 against.\n\nThe 1,076-page measure, which was hammered out by a bipartisan group of senators known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" now faces an arduous journey through the legislative process. While both supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass the Senate, some Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have expressed concerns about its prospects in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Democrats are pushing for the bill to fulfill a promise to Hispanic Americans, a key voting bloc, to address the limbo of the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country. In a bid to build momentum for the proposal, Obama emphasized that the bill would increase spending on border security, require undocumented immigrants to undergo background checks, learn English, pay taxes, and pay a penalty before pursuing a 13-year path to citizenship.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, who voted for opening debate, questioned the bill's focus on granting permanent legal status to undocumented immigrants without sufficient border security measures. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a member of the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" and a potential GOP presidential contender in 2016, has also expressed concerns about border security and is pushing for amendments to make Congress, not the executive branch, responsible for deciding if security metrics at the border have been met before other aspects of the reform bill are triggered.\n\nThe vote on the Rubio amendment is expected to be closely watched as floor action unfolds over the next three weeks. Other planned amendments will involve stepped-up security checks of people entering the country, temporary visas for high- and low-skilled workers, and other technical provisions.\n\nIn the House, a bipartisan group has been working on a separate immigration plan, but the effort suffered a setback last week when a key member dropped out of the negotiations. Previous efforts to pass immigration reform fell short in the last decade, despite being a priority of President George W. Bush. Now, Obama has made the issue a major priority of his second term.",
    " Title: Trump Nominates Representative Ryan Zinke as Interior Secretary\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has selected first-term Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana as his nominee for the position of Interior Secretary. The announcement was made by a senior transition official on Tuesday.\n\nRyan Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, will be tasked with leading the Interior Department, which employs over 70,000 people and manages more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite.\n\nZinke's selection was unexpected, as some Republican officials had hoped he would challenge Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana in the 2018 elections. Initially, Trump had considered nominating U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state for the position.\n\nZinke, who is 55 years old, is a proponent of keeping public lands under federal ownership, a stance that contrasts with some within his Republican Party who favor privatization or state control. It remains unclear where Zinke stands on increasing drilling and mining on federal lands, a promise made by Trump during his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump's official energy platform calls for onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminating the coal leasing moratorium, and opening shale energy deposits. It is unclear whether Zinke's nomination signals a shift in policy regarding federal land use for energy development.\n\nCongresswoman McMorris Rodgers, who was previously rumored to have been picked for the post, stated on Tuesday that she had never been offered the job. McMorris Rodgers had met with Trump at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, shortly after the president-elect began his Cabinet search.\n\nZinke was an early supporter of Trump and has voted for legislation that weakens environmental safeguards on public land. However, unlike other candidates who were considered for the interior secretary position, Zinke opposes the transfer of public lands to the states, a stance that aligns with Trump's.\n\nTrump has expressed opposition to transferring public land to the states, stating that he believes the land should be protected rather than sold for energy or commercial development. In July, Zinke resigned as a delegate to the Republican nominating convention due to the party platform's call for transferring public lands to the states.\n\nPublic land comprises more than 30 percent of Montana, according to the Montana Wilderness Association. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. The Wilderness Society, a leading conservation group, expressed concern over Zinke's support for logging, drilling, and mining on public lands.\n\nThe Interior Department also oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs and handles tribal policy. Under the Obama administration, the department played a significant role in efforts to limit fossil fuel development in some areas in an attempt to curb the effects of climate change. It remains to be seen how Zinke's nomination will impact these policies.",
    " Title: Harvey Weinstein Indicted on Rape Charges in Manhattan\n\nArticle:\n\nHarvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood producer, was indicted on charges of first- and third-degree rape in one case and a first-degree sex act in a second case by a Manhattan grand jury on May 30. The charges stem from allegations made by two women, one of whom he is accused of raping and another of forcing to perform oral sex.\n\nWeinstein surrendered to authorities in New York on May 25 and was arraigned shortly thereafter. Bond was set at $10 million or $1 million cash, which he paid with a cashier's check. Weinstein was also required to relinquish his passport and wear a GPS monitoring system. He is only permitted to travel between New York and Connecticut.\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, reiterated Weinstein's contention that he did not engage in nonconsensual sexual activities. Weinstein is expected to enter a plea of not guilty.\n\nThe indictment comes two days after reports that federal prosecutors had begun a sex crimes investigation into Weinstein and that a state grand jury had convened to hear evidence in sexual assault allegations against the producer.\n\nOne of the women pressing charges against Weinstein is Lucia Evans, who confirmed to the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow that she is the accuser in the first-degree rape charge. Evans alleges that in 2004, when she was an aspiring actress, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him at the Miramax office in Tribeca, just blocks from the NYPD precinct where Weinstein turned himself in on Friday.\n\nActress Paz de la Huerta told Vanity Fair that Weinstein raped her in 2010 at a Manhattan hotel, but her allegations are not part of the charges expected to be filed against Weinstein. However, she may testify if asked.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance will be faced with the decision of whether to prosecute Weinstein, under public pressure from critics of his previous decision not to prosecute Weinstein in connection with a 2015 sexual assault allegation, and from the #MeToo movement more generally.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday after the indictment, Vance said, \"This indictment brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which he is now charged.\"\n\nWeinstein's connection to Vance could play a role in the future of this case. In 2015, Weinstein was investigated by the NYPD, and model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez reported to police that Weinstein had grabbed her breasts and tried to reach up her skirt during a meeting at his Tribeca office. Despite a recording in which Weinstein appeared to admit to the incident, Vance's office decided not to press charges.\n\nWeinstein's defense team during the investigation included two other Vance donors, Linda Fairstein and Elkan Abramowitz, who was also Vance's former law partner, according to the New York Times. Vance was reelected in November after running unopposed and in January announced that he would no longer accept donations from lawyers with pending cases before his office.\n\nThe issue of donations matters not just for the previous Weinstein case but for the current one. Weinstein has hired high-powered defense attorney Ben Brafman to represent him this time around. Brafman's firm has donated about $4,600 to Vance in the past, the Times reports. And Vance has declined to prosecute two high-profile Brafman clients accused of rape in the past: lawyer Sanford A. Rubenstein in 2015 and French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011.\n\nNow, of course, critics are watching Vance for any sign of favoritism toward Weinstein. And the rise of the #MeToo movement means public opinion around the case may look different than it did for, say, Strauss-Kahn.\n\nWe don't yet know how all these conflicting forces will come into play at a trial, if the case goes that route. What we do know is that the man whose name has become inextricably linked with #MeToo has been arrested and will likely soon be charged. Whatever happens next, the whole country will be watching.",
    " Title: Fed Chairman Warns of Economic Recession if Budget Crisis Not Averted\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke painted a grim picture of the U.S. economy during his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, warning that a budget crisis could lead to a recession and the loss of 1.25 million jobs in 2013. The Fed is prepared to take further action to support the economy if unemployment remains high, but Bernanke did not specify any imminent steps or actions.\n\nThe economy is currently growing modestly but has weakened, with manufacturing slowing, consumers spending less, and job growth averaging 75,000 per month in the April-June quarter compared to 226,000 per month from January through March. The unemployment rate remains at 8.2 percent.\n\nBernanke's most urgent concern is the potential economic impact of the budget impasse in Congress, which could result in tax increases and deep spending cuts at the end of the year. If no agreement is reached, the Congressional Budget Office has warned that a recession would occur, and 1.25 million fewer jobs would be created in 2013.\n\nThe economy, after growing at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the second half of 2011, slowed to roughly 2 percent from January through March and likely weakened further in the April-June period. Congress needs to resolve its impasse well before the year ends to reduce uncertainty and boost household and business confidence, Bernanke said.\n\nThe potential job losses from the budget cuts could be as high as 2 million, according to a report released Tuesday by the Aerospace Industries Association. A separate report Tuesday highlighted the budget crises many states are facing due to shrinking federal revenue.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are demanding deeper spending cuts, while extending income tax cuts for everyone. Democrats want to extend the tax cuts for middle- and lower-class Americans but let them expire for people in the highest-income brackets. Bernanke stopped short of telling Congress what steps to take, challenging them to think broadly.\n\nThe economy's challenges go beyond the budget impasse, Bernanke said. Lawmakers must also produce a long-term plan to shrink federal budget deficits to avoid a potential financial crisis marked by rising interest rates. Stocks rose sharply despite Bernanke's grim assessment.\n\nBernanke also addressed Europe's debt crisis, stating that the Fed has been working with U.S. banks to ensure they have taken steps to prepare for a potential crisis. He expressed hope that European leaders would find solutions but acknowledged the risk of a more serious financial blowup.\n\nInvestors had hoped Bernanke would signal another round of bond purchases, but they seemed to shrug off the downbeat outlook and focused on stronger earnings reported by companies like Mattel and Coca-Cola. At least one senator implored Bernanke to take action now, stating that the Fed is the only game in town and urging Bernanke to take whatever actions are warranted. Even if the Fed announces another round of bond purchases, some economists question how much it might help, as mortgage rates and other key borrowing rates are already at record lows.\n\nThe Fed's policymaking committee last met on June 19-20, during which it extended a program that shifts its bond portfolio to try to lower long-term interest rates and reiterated its plan to keep its key short-term interest rate near zero until at least late 2014. Minutes of the June meeting show that Fed officials were open to taking further action but were divided over whether the economy needs help now. Former Fed official Roberto Perli, managing director at the research firm International Strategy & Investment, doubts the Fed will take action at its next meeting on July 31-Aug. 1, preferring to wait for more evidence of where the economy is headed. However, if growth and job creation continue to weaken, Perli says, Fed policymakers might unveil another round of bond purchases at its Sept. 12-13 meeting.",
    " Title: New York Times Allegation Against Brett Kavanaugh: A Closer Look at the Details and Corroboration\n\nArticle:\n\nA new allegation of sexual misconduct against U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has surfaced in a forthcoming book by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. The book, titled \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\" is set to be released on Tuesday, but an excerpt was published in the New York Times on Sunday, September 13.\n\nThe new allegation, which echoes an on-the-record allegation made by Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez in 2018, is that during his freshman year, Kavanaugh's classmate Max Stier saw him with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends allegedly pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\n\nHowever, the authors provide no clear details about the logistics of the alleged incident, such as who the friends are, who the female student is, or if there were any witnesses besides Stier. The authors only write that Stier notified senators and the FBI about the account, but the FBI did not investigate, and Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.\n\nThe book's authors corroborated the fact that Stier made the allegation to the FBI, but they give no indication that they have corroborated any details of the alleged incident. Mollie Hemingway, who obtained a copy of the book before its release, notes that the woman Max Stier named as having been allegedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event.\n\nThe new allegation is supposed to help lend credence to Ramirez's on-the-record allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself as a college freshman at a party. Pogrebin and Kelly sum up Ramirez's allegation: \"She and some classmates had been drinking heavily when, she says, a freshman named Brett Kavanaugh pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it. Some of the onlookers, who had been passing around a fake penis earlier in the evening, laughed.\"\n\nPogrebin and Kelly downplay Ramirez's own doubts about whether Kavanaugh did what she now alleges, choosing rather to lard up their New York Times story with details that are supposed to demonstrate how under-privileged Ramirez was. None of these details corroborates her accusation against Kavanaugh.\n\nAs I wrote last October, here's why Ramirez's allegation was dubious: Deborah Ramirez is the Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's who now claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself as a college freshman at a party. Ramirez's claim was already dubious because (1) named eyewitnesses deny the allegation and (2) Ramirez herself wasn't sure in recent weeks if Kavanaugh had done what she now alleges. \"Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself,\" the New York Times reported. Ramirez was only willing to make the allegation, the New Yorker reported, after \"six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney.\"\n\nPogrebin and Kelly write that a couple of students say they had heard about the alleged incident in the days after it allegedly occurred, but the authors provide no indication there is any first-hand witness to corroborate the allegation. We already knew before Kavanaugh was confirmed last October that the \"corroborating\" source for Ramirez's claim, classmate Kenneth Appold, was not present when the alleged incident occurred, but Appold told the New Yorker he was \"one-hundred-percent-sure\" he heard about it from an eyewitness. Shortly before Kavanaugh was confirmed, the New Yorker reported that Appold's supposed eyewitness \"said that he had no memory of the incident.\"\n\nUpdate 9/16: Late yesterday, the New York Times \"updated\" their article to note that it initially \"did not include\" the information that the alleged victim did not recall the alleged assault.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown Halts Key Budget Reports, Leaves Fiscal Data Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown has resulted in key agencies ceasing the production of budget information, including reports on deficits, spending, and the economy, which could aid Congress in its deliberations on these issues. The exact financial implications of the shutdown, whether it will result in savings or additional costs, remain uncertain due to the absence of these reports.\n\nThree significant reports have already been canceled due to the shutdown. Last week, the Labor Department postponed the release of the September jobs report, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Treasury Department announced they would not be completing their monthly budget reviews. As a result, the government is unaware of the final deficit for fiscal year 2013, which ended a week ago.\n\n\"Because a lapse in appropriated funds has caused CBO to largely shut down its operations, the Monthly Budget Review will not be published today or during the duration of the government shutdown,\" the agency stated.\n\nThe shutdown has also delayed another CBO report, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization that studies fiscal issues. This report, initially scheduled for this month, would have provided tax and spending options for reducing the deficit.\n\n\"The irony of this whole thing is we just shut down our means to have those budget options to avoid the shutdown,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the committee.\n\nAs the shutdown enters its second week, all parties are contemplating the political and fiscal repercussions. The 1995 and 1996 shutdowns reportedly cost the government $1.4 billion, equivalent to $2.1 billion in today's dollars, according to a Clinton-era budget office report. The primary expense was back pay for furloughed employees.\n\nThe cost of the current shutdown remains uncertain, with some analysts suggesting it could save money due to program suspensions and reduced employee numbers, while others argue that it requires funds to shut down and restart operations.\n\n\"That makes sense because it is costing money to mothball and open things, and shutdowns involve that,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO director and now president of the American Action Forum. However, he noted that the cost of a shutdown is \"not a lot of money\" in relation to the federal budget.\n\nThe longer the shutdown persists, the more reports are likely to be delayed. The problem for federal agencies is that budget analysts have been furloughed as part of the 800,000 federal employees whose jobs were deemed non-essential for protecting life or property. At the CBO, only about 10% of agency employees are working, focusing on bills actively under consideration in Congress.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX) stated that the lack of information benefits the White House, as it conceals unfavorable budget data. \"Discovered another reason why WH likes the'shutdown.' The Congressional Budget Office won't publish reports due to lapse of funds. Guess the WH thinks no news on fiscal matters is good news,\" Mr. Cornyn said in a Twitter message.\n\nMr. Holtz-Eakin acknowledged that the lack of data is detrimental but not catastrophic. \"In general, policymakers have very little feel for how the economy's doing in real time. At best, you're getting something that's a month old, and this will make that worse,\" he said. He also suggested that the economic damage estimates might be overblown.\n\nEven amid the shutdown, some numbers continue to emerge. The Treasury Department is still producing the Daily Treasury Statement, which shows the status of the federal debt, and last week, the department released a politically charged report arguing that approaching the debt limit could cause the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n\nIn the report, titled \"The Potential Macroeconomic Effect of Debt Ceiling Brinkmanship,\" the administration argued that the 2011 debt fight, when Congress raised the limit at the last minute, provided only a taste of the potential damage if the limit isn't raised and the government defaults.\n\nThe general lack of information has left private analysts to fill the gap with their own calculations and data. For example, the Alliance for American Manufacturing has solicited anecdotal stories from workers about their job searches in lieu of the official jobs report. The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, issued a report suggesting that if the government continued spending without regard to the deficit, the economy might have added 260,000 jobs.\n\nAnalysts stated that the data for the September report were collected in the middle of last month and could still be compiled. However, they expressed concern that if the shutdown continues into the middle of October, it could impair the department's ability to collect data for this month's report.",
    " Title: Trump Nominates Heather Nauert, Former Fox News Anchor, as U.N. Ambassador\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate Heather Nauert, the current State Department spokeswoman and former Fox News host, as the United States' next ambassador to the United Nations. If confirmed by the Senate, Nauert will replace Nikki Haley, who is set to leave the post at the end of the year.\n\nNauert joined the State Department in April 2017, having previously worked at ABC and Fox News. She did not travel extensively with her first boss at the department, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, but has been more active under current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nNauert's nomination has been met with some criticism, particularly over a tourist-like Instagram post from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during a trip focused on the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. There have also been other missteps, such as citing D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy against the Nazis, as an example of America's strong relationship with Germany.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Nauert has been a strong defender of President Trump at the podium, a fact that Trump has acknowledged. \"She's excellent, she's been with us a long time, she's been a supporter for a long time,\" Trump said of Nauer on Nov. 1.\n\nThe State Department previously held daily briefings, but this has been scaled back to two a week, at most. Nauert, 48, has been balancing her job in Washington, D.C. with her family in New York. Before joining the Trump administration, she had no government or foreign policy experience, though she did work on some overseas assignments for ABC, including in Baghdad.",
    " Title: Proposed Measures to Address Central American Migration Caravans and U.S.-Mexico Border Security\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing migration caravans from Central American countries, primarily Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, have been a contentious issue in the United States. These groups, often numbering in the thousands, are traveling through Mexico with the aim of reaching the U.S. border. The author suggests several strategies to address this issue, focusing on economic and political measures.\n\n1. Economic Leverage: The author proposes utilizing economic leverage against Mexico, a country that currently allows these migrant caravans to pass through without significant intervention. The U.S. could impose taxes on remittances sent by Mexican nationals living in the U.S. illegally, or even halt these transfers altogether. This could serve as a deterrent for Mexico, as it relies heavily on remittances from its citizens living in the U.S.\n\n2. Employer Sanctions: The author suggests imposing severe fines on employers who hire illegal immigrants. This would make it difficult for illegal immigrants to find work, reducing their incentive to come to the U.S. This measure could be coupled with work requirements for welfare recipients, especially during periods of full employment.\n\n3. Addressing Corruption in Latin America: The author argues that the U.S. should take a more active role in Latin America, offering aid only to governments that demonstrate a commitment to controlling their borders and addressing corruption. The author suggests cutting off aid to corrupt governments and supporting reform-minded leaders who are willing to fight corruption and promote positive change within their countries.\n\n4. Brazilian Elections and the Bolsonaro Factor: The author discusses the upcoming Brazilian elections and the potential impact of candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who is running on an anti-corruption platform. The author suggests that Bolsonaro's victory could serve as a model for other countries in the region, encouraging them to fight corruption and promote positive change.\n\nIn conclusion, the author proposes a multi-faceted approach to address the issue of migration caravans from Central America. This approach includes economic measures, such as taxes on remittances and employer sanctions, political measures, such as aid conditionality and support for reform-minded leaders, and strategic engagement with countries in the region, such as Brazil. The goal is to make the U.S. a less attractive destination for illegal immigrants and to encourage positive change in their home countries.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Pushes for Rush Vote on 1,200-Page Amnesty Bill Amidst Transparency Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move reminiscent of the Obamacare debate, the U.S. Senate is facing criticism for a rushed process in the passing of the Gang of Eight's 1,200-page amnesty legislation. The vote, scheduled for 5:30 pm, is not solely on the Corker-Hoeven amendment, as previously thought. Instead, it is a vote on a procedural motion by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to end debate on a 1,200-page substitute bill, which has been merged with the Corker-Hoeven amendment.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio has expressed his opposition to the process, stating that he would not support a rushed and non-transparent approach. He has also issued a challenge to the bill's sponsors, questioning their commitment to extensive, open debate and expressing concern about passing the bill before members return to their constituents during the July 4th holiday.\n\nSenator Jeff Sessions, in a statement, noted that the bill, like Obamacare, risks being passed without thorough vetting. He emphasized that the amnesty bill lacks sufficient provisions for border security, a concern shared by many Americans. Sessions' statement suggests that a vote for the bill would not necessarily equate to a vote for security.\n\nFormer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has also weighed in on the issue, criticizing the Gang of Eight in a piece for Breitbart. The race is on as the Senate grapples with the amnesty bill, with transparency and border security at the forefront of the debate.",
    " Title: President Trump Endorses Grassley's Immigration Legislation, Encourages Support for Four Pillars of Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed his support for Senator Chuck Grassley's immigration legislation and the four pillars of the White House Immigration Reform and Border Security Framework. In a statement, the President praised Grassley's bill for addressing the four pillars: a lasting solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), ending chain migration, cancelling the visa lottery, and securing the border through building the wall and closing legal loopholes.\n\nThe Grassley bill, co-introduced with Senator Tom Cotton, provides a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DACA recipients, allocates $25 billion for border security and wall funding, and limits family-based migration while eliminating the diversity visa lottery. It remains unclear if the President has suggested changes to the original version of Grassley's legislation. Currently, no Democrats have publicly stated their support for this measure, and Republicans would need nine Democrats, if all Senate Republicans support Grassley's bill.\n\nIn addition to Grassley's bill, President Trump expressed encouragement by developments in the House, pointing to House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul's legislation. Goodlatte's bill, unveiled last month, takes a tougher stance on illegal immigration enforcement and addresses the future of DACA recipients, allowing beneficiaries to be eligible for 3-year renewable permits to stay in the U.S.\n\nOf the 70 security points included in the Trump administration's immigration wish list sent to Congress in October, half are not included in Goodlatte's bill. However, the bill does contain much of what the President has said he wants to see in an immigration bill, including a plan to fund the border wall and to end the chain migration system as well as the visa lottery program.\n\nGoodlatte's bill also includes a long-term plan for DACA recipients that outlines a potential path to citizenship while not necessarily favoring DACA recipients over other immigrants seeking citizenship. President Trump hailed Goodlatte's bill as \"a good starting point\" for his administration to accomplish its immigration goals.\n\nThe President suggested that with the budget deal behind him, his focus is on \"enacting responsible and commonsense immigration reform that delivers for the American People.\"",
    " Title: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Decision to Step Down from Senior Royal Roles: A Reflection of Britain's Troubled History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe decision of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry to step down from their roles as senior royals and pursue a more independent path has been met with a mix of reactions, with some viewing it as a bold move and others expressing surprise. The couple's decision has been linked to their experiences within the British royal family, which has a history rooted in colonialism, the slave trade, and policies of racial discrimination.\n\nThe legacy of Britain's colonial past, characterized by a global construct based on a doctrine of white supremacy, has been a contentious issue. The country's role in the slave trade, the recruitment of people from the Caribbean and Africa for low-paid work, and subsequent discrimination in education and housing, continues to resonate today. The recent scandal surrounding the wrongful deportation of black British people serves as a stark reminder of this troubled history.\n\nMeghan's decision to join the royal family, symbolically linked to this history, was perplexing to many black British people. The couple's decision to step back and protect their son, Archie, from the negative attention they have received, has been interpreted as a response to the challenges they have faced within the royal family.\n\nThe couple's actions, such as not giving Archie a title from birth and rumors of a potential relocation to southern Africa, were signs that they would not conform to traditional royal norms. In recent months, they have bypassed official royal channels and communicated directly with the press, as seen in Meghan's admission of finding royal life \"hard\" and Harry's revelation about the impact of his mother's death on his desire to protect his family.\n\nThe British press, which has been critical of the couple, has expressed shock at this move. However, for those who have been following the couple's actions closely, this decision may not have come as a surprise. The clues, it seems, have been there for some time for anyone willing to observe them.",
    " Title: UN Imposes New Sanctions on North Korea in Response to Missile Tests; Regime Vows \"Thousands-fold\" Revenge\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United Nations has imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). The sanctions, which were unanimously approved by the UN Security Council on Saturday, could reduce the regime's annual export revenue by a third, targeting key revenue earners such as coal, iron, lead, and seafood, but not oil.\n\nIn a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North Korean government described the sanctions as a \"violent violation of our sovereignty\" and part of a \"heinous plot to isolate and stifle\" the country. Pyongyang threatened to take \"righteous action,\" describing the sanctions as a crime for which the United States would pay \"thousands of times.\"\n\nThe new sanctions forbid China, Russia, and other countries from hiring any more North Korean laborers, whose remittances help fund the regime, and prohibit joint ventures with the country and any new investment in existing business partnerships. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, described the measures as \"the single largest economic sanctions package ever levelled\" against North Korea.\n\nThe US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, said on Monday that North Korea should halt missile launches if it wanted to negotiate. In a telephone call on Monday, US President Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, agreed that Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs \"pose a grave and growing direct threat\" and vowed to apply maximum pressure on the regime.\n\nNorth Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, is aware of the fate of other dictators who lack nuclear weapons. Much of the regime's domestic legitimacy rests on portraying the country as under constant threat from the United States and its regional allies, South Korea, and Japan. To support the claim that it is in Washington's crosshairs, North Korea cites the tens of thousands of US troops lined up along the southern side of the demilitarized zone \u2013 the heavily fortified border dividing the Korean peninsula. Faced with what it says are US provocations, North Korea says it has as much right as any other state to develop a nuclear deterrent.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that Trump and Moon had agreed that advances in North Korean missile technology, achieved despite eight rounds of multilateral sanctions in the past 11 years, posed \"a grave and growing direct threat to the United States, South Korea, and Japan, as well as to most countries around the world.\" In an hour-long phone call on Monday, the leaders said they would continue to apply pressure to the North. Joint US-South Korean military exercises this month are expected to provoke an angry response.\n\nMoon, who supports cautious engagement with North Korea, told Trump the door should remain open to dialogue, provided Pyongyang agreed to abandon its nuclear program. In a Twitter post, Trump said he was \"very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote\" on the sanctions, but China has said any punitive actions targeting North Korea must \"avoid bringing disaster\" to the economically fragile state.\n\nIn a front-page commentary on Monday, the overseas edition of the ruling Communist party's official People's Daily said sanctions must be employed with precision. \"Sanctions to the greatest possible extent must avoid causing negative impacts to ordinary people and to third countries, and avoid bringing disaster to the country in question's normal and legal trade and business exchanges with the outside world, people's normal lives, and the humanitarian situation,\" the paper said.",
    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder's Consequential Tenure Marked by Controversial and Groundbreaking Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a nearly six-year tenure that has been one of the most significant in United States history, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. announced his resignation on Thursday, stating he will remain in office until his successor's confirmation. As the first African-American to serve as the nation's top law enforcement official, Holder made history the moment he took office.\n\nIn a position that rarely encourages boldness and in the face of a frequently hostile Congress, Holder has consistently staked out strong and laudable legal positions on many of the most contested issues of our time. However, his tenure is marred by the role the Justice Department played in matters of secrecy and national security under his leadership.\n\nSame-Sex Marriage\nIn 2011, Holder announced that the Justice Department would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage under federal law as between a man and a woman. The law was unconstitutional, he said. This critical moment foreshadowed both President Obama's own \"evolution\" on same-sex marriage the following year and the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling invalidating an important part of the law. Since the court's decision, nearly two dozen federal courts have struck down state bans on same-sex marriage throughout the country, and the Supreme Court has been asked again to rule on whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage\u2014a question it dodged in 2013.\n\nVoting Rights\nHolder successfully fought discriminatory voting restrictions around the country before the 2012 elections. When the Supreme Court gutted the core of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, he was quick to find new ways to challenge discriminatory laws. Shortly after the ruling, the Justice Department joined lawsuits challenging new restrictions like strict voter-ID requirements and cutbacks to voting hours in North Carolina and Texas. In both states, Republican-controlled legislatures imposed rules that most heavily burden poorer and minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic.",
    " Title: Trump Expands on Foreign Policy Stances in Anti-Terrorism Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a measured and scripted address at a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, refrained from making wild, ad hoc accusations, marking a shift in his campaign's unpredictable trajectory. However, the speech's implications could resonate for days or weeks to come, as Trump emphasized the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and expanded upon his controversial foreign policy statements.\n\nTrump proposed that the U.S. collaborate with Russia in \"coalition operations\" to fight ISIS, a significant departure from the current Obama administration's policy. He acknowledged Russia's stake in the outcome in Syria, emphasizing their battles with Islamic terror. This suggestion, if implemented, would likely alter the U.S.'s long-standing position regarding Russia's support for Syria's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe speech's most repeated phrase was Trump's proposal for \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants or refugees from regions plagued by terrorism. This process would involve questions about their adherence to a \"tolerant\" way of life and agreement with U.S. values regarding women's rights, the rule of law, and the primacy of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nCritics on social media questioned the feasibility of such a test, suggesting it could be easily manipulated. They also noted similarities between this approach and Trump's previously proposed temporary ban on the entry of non-citizen Muslims into the U.S., which has been criticized as a form of religious discrimination.\n\nTrump also distanced himself from his previous statement advocating for the U.S. to withdraw from NATO unless other members increased their financial contributions. He acknowledged NATO's new anti-terrorism initiative and suggested that this might justify the U.S.'s continued membership.\n\nTrump's allies praised the speech, with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani stating, \"He has the temperament to win.\" Critics, however, such as President Obama's former speechwriter Jon Favreau, tweeted, \"That speech was a reminder that Prompter Trump will always be just as dishonest and incompetent as Twitter Trump.\"\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: House Speaker Paul Ryan Ends Congressional Session After 25-Hour Democratic Sit-In on Gun Control\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) adjourned the House of Representatives early Thursday morning following a 25-hour sit-in led by congressional Democrats, who were unsuccessful in their attempt to force a vote on gun control measures. The sit-in, which began around 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, unfolded on the House floor with little advance warning.\n\nDuring the sit-in, Democrats repeated their chant \"No bill, no break!\" and waved papers with the names of gun violence victims written in black. A core group of Democrats remained on the House floor for several hours, wrapped in blankets and resting on pillows. The sit-in ended early Thursday afternoon, hours after Republicans held a final vote on the Zika response and sent lawmakers home until July 5.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that the Democrats had made \"some progress\" in dramatizing the arguments for action to stem gun violence, despite the failure to conjure a vote. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) stated that the public should not be satisfied with a Republican majority that shut down the House and disregarded \"the unfinished business of the American people.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, claimed that their colleagues had accomplished nothing other than disrupting the business of the House to score political points. The sit-in was a response to the shooting rampage at a Florida gay nightclub earlier this month that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. The mass shooting followed similar tragic incidents over the past years, including the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nThe sit-in was reminiscent of a 1960s-style protest, as some lawmakers sat on the floor, others in their seats. The House chamber grew increasingly chaotic as the night wore on, and some lawmakers took breaks on pillows and blankets. C-SPAN broadcast live video streamed on Periscope and Facebook from lawmakers' accounts, as the cameras in the House gallery were turned off for most of the protest.\n\nIn the past, both parties have staged similar protests. In 2008, Democrats controlling the House at the time turned off the cameras amid a GOP push for a vote to expand oil and gas drilling. Republicans occupied the floor, delivering speech after speech, while Pelosi, then the House speaker, sent lawmakers bolting to their August recess. Pelosi at that time had ordered the cameras turned off.\n\nThe sit-in was not the first instance of agitation for action caused by gun violence in the Capitol. Last week, a Senate filibuster took place in response to the same cause. The sit-in, led by Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who had participated in the civil rights sit-ins in the 1960s, marked \"some progress\" in the lawmakers' efforts to get the attention of the nation to recognize the need for a vote on gun control legislation. Lewis is also backing the controversial legislation to keep people on the no-fly list from getting guns.",
    " Title: Trump Delivers Polished Address to Congress, Aims for Bipartisan Cooperation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his debut speech to Congress, President Donald Trump awarded himself a C or C+ in terms of messaging, stating, \"I would give myself a C or a C+ [on communication].\" The speech, delivered on Tuesday night, was described as the most polished and optimistic address of Trump's political career thus far.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, noted, \"This speech was a new face on the president that looked very presidential.\" After nearly six weeks in office, Trump's supporters hope he is finding his stride and learning from his early stumbles.\n\nThe next phase of Trump's political journey now moves to Congress, where he will embark on the delicate task of trying to pass a budget, and legislation on health care, tax reform, and immigration. The success of these endeavors remains to be seen.\n\nTrump's speech contained many of the touchstones of a typical State of the Union address, including calls for healing, hope, and bipartisanship in the name of a common national purpose. He also addressed recent acts of vandalism and threats against Jewish targets and the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas last week, following criticism that he was slow to speak out against such attacks.\n\nEmbedded in Trump's agenda, Democrats warn, is the threat of mass deportations, the gutting of environmental protections, and the loss of health coverage for millions of newly insured low-income Americans. The travel ban, which temporarily barred travel to the US by citizens of seven largely Muslim countries and suspended Syrian refugee resettlement, was not discussed in the speech.\n\nTrump's speech also emphasized his campaign theme of \"America first,\" including a major increase in defense spending, a pull-back from multilateral trade agreements, the border wall, and tax cuts for corporations and the middle class. He expressed support for NATO, but also signaled a retrenchment of America's role on the global stage.\n\nThe speech won early high marks from the American public, with 7 in 10 Americans who tuned in saying it made them feel more optimistic about the country, according to a CNN poll. However, these are early days for the mercurial Trump, and it's anybody's guess as to whether he can maintain the more presidential posture he adopted Tuesday night.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump's inflammatory rhetoric was a point of contention. However, his supporters and family members urged him to tone it down. Now, his supporters have a more positive message to point to. Republican strategist Ford O'Connell points to a particular moment of \"optimism and compassion\" in Tuesday's speech: \"Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.\"\n\nNot all Democrats were moved by Trump's message. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) dismissed his talk of clean air and water as \"empty\" words. He was also unimpressed by the president's inclusive language. \"It's just a rehash of everything we've heard before,\" said Senator Merkley, one of the chamber's most liberal members.\n\nDemocrats are in the minority on Capitol Hill, and they have pledged to do everything they can to block a Trump agenda that aims to undo key parts of President Obama's legacy. However, Republicans are hopeful. \"Trump's overall goal of the address was to instill in Congress the 'will to govern,' to compromise where possible in an effort to get things done on behalf of the American people,\" writes Mr. O'Connell in an email. \"It's not an easy task in a broken, bipartisan town like Washington, D.C. But on this night, he succeeded.\"",
    " Title: Unemployment Rate Rises as Job Growth Slows in May\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States unemployment rate increased from 8.1 percent to 8.2 percent in May, according to a report released by the Labor Department on Friday. The slowdown in job growth was significant, with only 69,000 jobs created during the month, marking the weakest growth in a year. This is far below the 115,000 jobs previously reported for April and a fraction of the 226,000 jobs added each month during the first quarter.\n\nThe construction industry, which had seen unusual job gains in the winter due to mild weather, reported a loss of jobs in May. The business services sector, a vital sector that has created 1.4 million jobs since the end of the recession, also saw a loss of 1,000 jobs. However, the health care, transportation, and wholesaling sectors reported healthy job gains.\n\nJohn Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia Securities, commented, \"This is a major disappointment. There was major weakness in construction.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 150 points at the start of trading Friday morning, reflecting Wall Street's expectations of twice the reported job gains.\n\nChris Williamson, economist at Markit, suggested that the slowdown could be due to payback after stronger-than-usual hiring earlier in the year due to warmer-than-normal weather in the winter months. However, he also noted that it could indicate a \"fundamental\" slowdown in the economy that will lead to further rises in the unemployment rate.\n\nDan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes, described the spring slowdown as \"an ugly trend in this most important of indicators.\" He predicted that the report will provoke a \"heated\" political debate about the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nRepublicans quickly seized on the news as evidence that President Obama's economic policies are not effective. House Speaker John Boehner, Ohio Republican, stated, \"President Obama's failed policies have made high unemployment and a weak economy the sad new normal for families and small businesses.\"\n\nHowever, Alan B. Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, argued that the report shows \"the economy is still growing, but it is not growing fast enough.\" He attributed the slowdown to \"headwinds\" from the European economic crisis and the spike in gasoline prices this spring, which is now on the wane.\n\nIn addition to the slowdown in job growth, the rise in unemployment also reflected a surge in people looking for work but unable to find jobs. About 642,000 more people went on a job hunt last month, but only 422,000 of those landed jobs, according to the department.\n\nAparna Mathur, economist at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that the job market has fallen into a spring slump for the second year in a row. She suggested that one underlying source of friction is the millions of long-term unemployed people who lack the technical skills needed to fill many of the jobs that are coming open, creating a situation where both employers and the unemployed cannot find what they need and want.",
    " Title: President Trump Denies Campaign's Russian Connection, Accuses U.S. Intelligence Community of Leaking Information\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has denied allegations that his associates had contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, labeling the reports as \"non-sense.\" In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the president accused the U.S. intelligence community of illegally leaking information to news outlets.\n\n\"This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton\u2019s losing campaign,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. He also claimed that the \"real scandal\" is that the intelligence community is giving out classified information \"like candy.\"\n\nThe president's tweets come after multiple news outlets, including CNN and The New York Times, reported Tuesday that Russian officials were in contact with members of Mr. Trump's team during the campaign. According to CNN, advisers close to Mr. Trump were in \"constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence.\"\n\nAmong those reportedly communicating with Russian nationals was former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Mr. Manafort denied that he ever knowingly talked to any intelligence official \"or anyone in Russia regarding anything of what\u2019s under investigation.\"\n\n\"I have never had any connection to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the Russian government before, during or after the campaign,\" he told CNN.\n\nMr. Trump and his team have consistently denied any contacts between the campaign and Russian officials ahead of November's election. The reports come on the heels of the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The White House said Tuesday that Mr. Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about the nature of his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the November election but before Mr. Trump was sworn into office.",
    " Title: California Primary Election: Clinton and Sanders Battle for Delegates in Upcoming Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the California primary election set for Tuesday, the race for Democratic delegates remains uncertain as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders vie for one of California's 475 delegates. In a recent interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Clinton expressed confidence in her chances, stating, \"I believe, on Tuesday, I will have decisively won the popular vote and I will have decisively won the pledged delegate majority.\"\n\nSanders, however, has expressed a different perspective, telling reporters in Los Angeles that it is unlikely Clinton will secure enough pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night. He suggested that the Democratic National Convention could potentially become a contested convention, with no candidate having enough pledged delegates to claim a clear victory.\n\nThe \"Bernie or Bust\" movement, in which some Sanders supporters have pledged not to vote for Clinton in the general election if she is the nominee, could potentially pose a challenge to Clinton's campaign. A Quinnipiac University poll indicates that 25% of Sanders supporters would not vote for Clinton if she were the nominee against presumed Republican nominee Donald Trump. In California, where the USC Dornsife/LA Times poll indicates that Clinton trails Sanders 43% to 44%, only 65% of Sanders supporters in the California primary have stated they would definitely support Clinton in a Clinton-Trump face-off.\n\nAs of Sunday, following Puerto Rico's primary, Clinton holds 1,809 delegates and 548 superdelegates, totaling 2,357. To secure the nomination, Clinton needs at least 2,382 delegates. In the upcoming Democratic primaries on Tuesday (when party voters head to the polls in California, New Jersey, the Dakotas, Montana, and New Mexico), 694 delegates, including 475 delegates in California, will be at stake.\n\nSanders has also been campaigning aggressively in California, criticizing Trump while also emphasizing the ongoing nature of the Democratic race. \"If we can win, and win big here in California and in the other states, and in Washington D.C., we are going to go into the Democratic convention with enormous momentum,\" Sanders told supporters during a rally outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. \"With your help, I believe, we will come out with the nomination.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Policy Debate on Egypt Crisis: No Consensus on Response to Military Takeover\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the political crisis in Egypt unfolds, President Barack Obama and other U.S. politicians are under pressure to clarify the U.S. response to the chaos in Cairo. The administration has so far declined to describe the situation as a coup d'etat, instead expressing concern without committing to a clear course of action.\n\nThe argument over the U.S. response to the Egyptian crisis is complex and has scrambled traditional partisan and ideological lines. A coalition that supported the Iraq intervention a decade ago, consisting of ardent Israel supporters and pro-democracy idealists, has begun to fray. Israel supporters are generally in favor of the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood government, while democracy advocates argue that his regime, despite its flaws, was legitimately elected and has now been illegitimately overthrown.\n\nThere is no consensus among traditional establishment voices. The Washington Post editorial page has criticized Obama's response as \"feckless,\" while The New York Times has praised his \"appropriate caution.\"\n\nUnder U.S. law, the $1.3 billion in American military aid that goes to Egypt must be suspended if Morsi's forcible ouster and the arrest of his allies are formally declared a coup.\n\nThis article outlines the emerging Washington camps on the upheaval in Egypt and what the United States ought to do about it. It is important to note that many people who have expressed views so far have done so with a tentativeness that suggests their views may change. Furthermore, some people fall naturally into more than one group.\n\nThere are those who find the military takeover preferable to the status quo under Morsi, with both Republicans and Democrats in this camp preferring to keep U.S. aid flowing as a way of maintaining influence within the Egyptian power structure and, with luck, coaxing the generals before too long to restore the Egyptian constitution and civilian rule.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) is one such voice, stating, \"The Egyptian military has long been a key partner of the United States and a stabilizing force in the region, and is perhaps the only trusted national institution in Egypt today.\"\n\nOthers argue that the Egyptian military is known for a self-protective, self-dealing culture that insulates it from accountability to civilian authority. However, the military is regarded as a force against religious radicalism and in favor of regional stability.\n\nDavid Brooks, writing in The New York Times, suggests that the military takeover may bring Egypt back to a bloated and dysfunctional state, but argues that radical Islam, the main threat to global peace, has been partially discredited and removed from office.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Criticize Debate Format for Lack of Policy Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the second round of U.S. Democratic presidential debates in Detroit, Michigan, on July 31, 2019, several candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris, expressed frustration with the debate format, which they felt did not allow for in-depth policy discussions.\n\nSenator Harris, who faced a series of attacks on her record during the debate, stated that the limited time allotted for each candidate to answer a question (60 seconds) and rebut an attack (30 seconds) prevented a thorough exploration of policy issues. \"It can be a frustrating process. There are so many of these issues that can not be captured in 60 seconds,\" Harris said.\n\nBiden, the Democratic front-runner, who faced criticism over healthcare, immigration, and criminal justice reform, echoed Harris' sentiments, stating that it was difficult to explain complicated topics in less than one minute. \"That's not a debate. I understand why it has to be that way, but I'm looking forward to getting to a place where we can actually exchange ideas,\" he said.\n\nThe crowded field of more than two dozen candidates vying for the Democratic nomination has led to back-to-back nights of debates featuring 10 candidates each, resulting in rapid-fire exchanges that frustrated both candidates and viewers. Former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee criticized the \"game show rules\" of the debate, stating, \"These people are trying to be president - not win a Buick!\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has increased the fundraising and polling requirements to qualify for participation in an effort to reduce the number of candidates on stage for the next debate, which is not scheduled until September.\n\nBiden and Harris both stated that they were not surprised to be the target of attacks from all directions during the debate. Harris commented, \"If you're considered a front-runner, you should be prepared to take a hit. So there was nothing about last night that surprised me.\"\n\nBiden criticized the debate's focus on past policies, particularly those of former President Barack Obama, who remains the most popular figure in the Democratic Party. \"I hope in the next debate we can talk about how we can fix the things that Trump has broken, not how Barack Obama made all these mistakes, because he didn't,\" Biden said.\n\nHarris and Biden clashed early in the debate over their healthcare plans, with Harris criticizing Biden's proposal for leaving too many people uninsured and Biden ridiculing Harris' plan as not requiring a middle-class tax hike. Senator Cory Booker, who clashed with Biden on criminal justice records, stated at a Detroit rally that the strife would eventually be forgotten, saying, \"We may be having a primary debate right now, but we know we are going to close ranks behind the candidate.\"",
    " Title: Moore Accuses Washington Post of Political Agenda Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nAlabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing romantic relationships with teenage girls, accusing The Washington Post of having a \"political agenda.\" During a campaign appearance in Birmingham on Saturday, Moore stated, \"In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivation and the content of this article.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Thursday that Moore, the former chief justice of Alabama's Supreme Court, pursued relationships with four teenage women dating back to the 1970s when he was in his early thirties and single. Moore has denied the allegations, though he admitted on Sean Hannity's radio show that \"after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies.\"\n\nOne woman told The Washington Post she was 14 when the 32-year-old Moore asked her out and made sexual advances. Top Republicans, including President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have stated that Moore should drop out of the race if the allegations are true. However, Moore has shown no sign of doing so.\n\nOn Saturday, Moore insisted the accusations about his conduct \"nearly 40 years ago\" are \"completely false and untrue.\" He also accused The Washington Post, which has endorsed his Democratic opponent Doug Jones, of \"yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for United States Senate.\"\n\nThe story has reportedly inflicted significant damage to Moore's campaign ahead of next month's special election for the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. There have been discussions of possible write-in campaigns from other Republicans, but nothing has materialized as of yet.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, President Trump, who has been traveling in Asia over the past week, did not seem interested in commenting further on the situation, stating he's been too busy reading documents and has not had time to catch up on television news coverage about Moore.",
    " Title: Washington Post Removes Controversial Cartoon Depicting Senator Cruz's Children\n\nArticle:\n\nSenators Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Florida) have been engaged in a contentious campaign trail over the past few weeks, vying for support in the Republican primary field. However, a recent event has united the two senators, as they have come together in condemnation of a controversial cartoon published by The Washington Post.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Washington Post published a cartoon by Ann Telnaes, the paper's editorial cartoonist, which depicted Senator Cruz dressed as Santa Claus accompanied by his two daughters, who were dressed in red outfits and appeared to be \"trained monkeys,\" as Cruz described.\n\nIn response to the cartoon, Senator Cruz tweeted, \"Classy. @washingtonpost makes fun of my girls. Stick w/ attacking me -- Caroline & Catherine are out of your league.\" Rubio also expressed his disapproval, tweeting, \"Wash Post cartoon featuring @tedcruz's children is disgusting. The Post saying the kids are 'fair game' is even worse.\"\n\nThe Cruz campaign swiftly turned the cartoon into a fundraising appeal, characterizing it as an attack on Cruz and his family from the \"liberal media.\" The first line of the email from Cruz's campaign, which included a screen grab of the cartoon, read, \"I'm sickened... I knew I'd be facing attacks from day one of my campaign, but I never expected anything like this.\"\n\nFollowing the backlash, The Washington Post removed the cartoon and issued an editor's note from Fred Hiatt, stating, \"It's generally been the policy of our editorial section to leave children out of it. I failed to look at this cartoon before it was published. I understand why Ann thought an exception to the policy was warranted in this case, but I do not agree.\" The headline still stood, reading, \"Ted Cruz uses his kids as political props (updated with statement),\" but the cartoon was replaced with the editor's note.",
    " Title: Cautious Optimism Surrounds Timeline for Coronavirus Vaccine Development\n\nArticle:\n\nThe development of an effective vaccine for the coronavirus is the only known means to end the ongoing pandemic. Over 100 potential vaccines are currently in various stages of development, with some already in human trials. The U.S. government's \"Operation Warp Speed,\" launched in May, aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, expressed \"cautious optimism\" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021.\n\nExperts suggest that the virus will continue to spread until approximately 70% of the population has developed immunity. Achieving this level of immunity, known as \"herd immunity,\" through a vaccine is considered the quickest and safest method, as opposed to waiting for enough people to become infected.\n\nHowever, there are significant reasons to be skeptical of the idea that a game-changing vaccine is just a few months away, experts say. Developing a vaccine by the end of the year or even by next summer would break the record for the fastest vaccine ever developed, which currently stands at four years. Even if this milestone is achieved, drug companies will still need to produce hundreds of millions of doses and distribute them to the people who need them.\n\nSome experts worry about investing too much in a best-case scenario, suggesting that a more prudent approach would be to prepare for a multi-year timeline by developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. There is also concern that the idea of a vaccine being imminent may be hindering the implementation of necessary virus mitigation measures.\n\nAdditionally, there is a risk that rushing development may lead to an unsafe vaccine reaching the market, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment among the public, and potentially undermining herd immunity. There is also the possibility that any new vaccine may not be entirely effective or may provide immunity only for a short period of time.\n\n\"An approved coronavirus vaccine won't do any good if people aren't willing to roll up their sleeves for it.\" - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nA vaccine will not be a magic solution, but it is still the best path out of the pandemic. \"If you're imagining there'll be one golden day when a vaccine is approved and the pandemic will be over \u2014 Finally! We can all crowd into one another's living rooms and resume choir practice again \u2014 I'm afraid it won't be quite like that. But it will be the beginning of the end. There's much to be hopeful about, and enormous challenges lie ahead.\" - Caroline Chen, ProPublica\n\n\"It would be a shame if production and supply chain bottlenecks, such as the ones faced for medical supplies, slow down vaccine availability after discovery. Production must be done globally to prevent bottlenecks, hoarding, and to facilitate efficient distribution of vaccines to local clinics.\" - Krishna B. Kumar, Mahshid Abir, and Christopher Nelson, The Hill\n\nWaiting on a miracle cure in the future is causing unnecessary deaths right now. \"Like an overly optimistic doctor, some policymakers are banking on a future vaccine that, at best, may arrive in 2021 while people are sick and dying now and the economy continues to be hobbled with an unclear path forward to stability. The tragedy is that there is a playbook that can reduce the number of cases and deaths right now.\" - Eric Schneider, Los Angeles Times.",

She attended the University of Oklahoma and, at the time, found it more practical to align with the Republican Party in the South. However, she is no longer a registered Republican, citing a shift in the party's stance that no longer aligns with her comfort.\n\nAnnie, on the other hand, shared her relationship with the Democratic Party, which she found similar to Lindsey's relationship with the Republican Party due to familial influences.\n\nTheir first significant interaction occurred during a summer internship in Washington D.C., where Lindsey's understanding of feminism was challenged. Initially, she held a misconceived notion that feminism was about giving undeserved opportunities to women. Through conversations with Annie and other colleagues, Lindsey came to understand the importance of feminism in challenging unacceptable treatment and recognizing her own worth.\n\nAnnie, in turn, learned from Lindsey the importance of embracing her womanhood and body confidence at a young age. Lindsey's self-assured demeanor and comfort with her sexuality inspired Annie to be more comfortable with her own body and sexuality.\n\nThe account concludes with both individuals acknowledging the significant impact each had on the other's personal growth and understanding of feminism.",

Ginsburg did not address the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia or President Donald Trump's travel ban, which could potentially be heard by the high court.\n\nGinsburg did, however, express a desire to change the Electoral College, a comment that received applause from the packed church. She did not elaborate on her reasons for this desire.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Ginsburg had stated that she presumed Democrat Hillary Clinton would win and have the opportunity to make a few appointments to the court. She had also called Trump a \"faker\" who \"really has an ego\" in one interview.\n\nGinsburg recalled Monday that she received bipartisan support for her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, with Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch being her most ardent supporter. \"I think today he wouldn't touch me with a 10-foot pole,\" she joked.\n\nGinsburg, who is the leader of the court's liberal wing and the oldest justice on the court, has survived pancreatic and colon cancer, causing concern among liberals about her health and the future of their causes if President Trump gets an opportunity to replace her or any of the other liberal judges on the bench.\n\nGinsburg supporters have joked about steps she could take to stay healthy, such as eating more kale. Asked by a Stanford student who else should eat more kale in Washington, D.C., the justice quipped, \"Justice Kennedy.\" Anthony Kennedy, who is 80 and is considered a swing vote, is the second oldest justice on the Supreme Court.\n\nGinsburg has shown no signs of slowing down and has said she has a personal trainer who leads her through hour-long workouts that include push-ups and weights. She said family plays a large part in her life, and she does not admit defeat. \"The attitude is I'm going to surmount this whatever it is,\" she said.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling Leaves FCC Free to Modify Indecency Policy, Protecting Children from Broadcast Content\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous 8-0 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not provide fair notice to networks when enforcing its indecency rules, effectively vacating fines imposed on Fox Television Stations and ABC. The ruling leaves the FCC free to modify its current indecency policy, with the potential to protect children from indecent broadcast content.\n\nThe ruling in FCC vs. Fox Television Stations did not address the central question of whether the FCC's indecency rules, which regulate the use of profanity or fleeting nudity on air, violate the First Amendment. Instead, the court focused on the FCC's due process violations.\n\nRepresentative Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a statement following the ruling, reminding media executives to exercise responsibility when using public airwaves to broadcast content into family homes.\n\nFCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, in a statement, acknowledged the ruling's potential impact on the FCC's current indecency policy, stating that the commission is reviewing the decision, which appears to be limited to procedural issues related to actions taken several years ago. Genachowski also assured lawmakers that the FCC will continue to protect young TV viewers in accordance with First Amendment principles.\n\nSenator Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the commerce committee, praised the ruling, stating that it leaves the FCC's authority to protect children from indecent programming intact. The ruling means that Fox and ABC will not face FCC fines and sanctions in their cases, and it signals that the FCC should revisit and potentially modify its policy.\n\nThe ruling stems from a series of court findings initiated by the FCC's decision to change the indecency rules following rock star Bono's impromptu utterance of an expletive during his acceptance speech at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards on NBC. Since the FCC changed its rules, it decided not to fine NBC at the time. The specifics of the FCC's next steps are currently unclear.",

The S&P 500 Index closed at a record high, led by the technology, health-care, and financial sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also reached a new peak, with 28 of 30 constituents showing positive gains. Most European and Asian shares also increased.\n\nTrade conflicts that had caused stock market volatility earlier in the week have since subsided. China is reportedly planning to reduce the average tariff rate it imposes on imports from the majority of its trading partners as early as next month. On Wednesday, Premier Li Keqiang stated that China's government would not devalue its currency to boost exports amid the trade war.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries remained above 3%, near its high for the year. The greenback weakened after a report suggested that the U.S. and Canada are unlikely to reach a deal on NAFTA in Washington this week. Jobless data was solid but did little to alter the overall sentiment. The pound surged after August retail sales came in higher than expected.\n\n\"The dollar has generally strengthened on tariff fears, especially against EM currencies,\" said Pravit Chintawongvanich, an equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. \"What you're seeing today is the opposite of that. EM equities and DM equities ex-U.S. are catching up. Today is a continuation of the risk-on theme we've seen in the last couple of days.\"\n\nEquity markets have remained resilient in the face of rising bond yields, suggesting that investors are comfortable with the outlook for corporate earnings and global growth despite the increase in borrowing costs and trade tensions. Ahead of the Fed meeting next week, some other central banks took center stage on Thursday, with Norway's policy makers raising interest rates for the first time in seven years as the SNB kept deposit rates unchanged.\n\nElsewhere, emerging-market assets continued to rally off the lows seen earlier this month, with the rand among the leading developing-world currencies as the South African Reserve Bank held its key interest rate at a two-year low. Norway's krone retreated as investors viewed the central bank's rate trajectory as dovish, while the Swiss franc strengthened.\n\nWest Texas crude dropped after U.S. President Donald Trump resumed his criticism of OPEC on Twitter.

    " Title: Israeli Government Denies Entry to U.S. Reps. Tlaib and Omar Amid Boycott Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli officials have blocked U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from entering the country as part of a planned visit. The move has sparked a significant outcry from Democratic lawmakers in Washington, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling it a \"sign of weakness\" and Omar accusing Israel of implementing \"Trump's Muslim ban.\"\n\nIn a statement, Omar said, \"It is an affront that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, under pressure from President Trump, would deny entry to representatives of the U.S. government.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the decision, stating that Tlaib and Omar's itinerary \"revealed that they planned a visit whose sole objective is to strengthen the boycott against us and deny Israel's legitimacy.\" Netanyahu noted that the Palestinian organization that planned the visit, MIFTAH, supports the boycott movement, and that people associated with the group have supported terror against Israel in the past.\n\nThe decision was made by Interior Minister Arye Deri and announced earlier Thursday by deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely, despite prior assurances that the congresswomen would be allowed in.\n\nOmar and Tlaib were among 17 members of Congress who voted against a resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement in July. This was after Omar introduced a resolution of her own that encouraged the use of boycotts as a political tool.\n\nIsrael welcomes critics, but not those who support boycotts of the Jewish State, according to Netanyahu. He confirmed that Deri would consider permitting Tlaib to visit her Palestinian family members if she filed a humanitarian request and promised not to promote boycotts of Israel while she visits.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Israel put out a statement of support for the decision, but Democratic lawmakers and even Israel's Washington allies were critical. Notably, pro-Israel lobby AIPAC tweeted that while they disagree with Omar and Tlaib's positions, \"We also believe every member of Congress should be able to visit and experience our democratic ally Israel firsthand.\"\n\nDemocrats expressed strong opposition to keeping Omar and Tlaib out. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said, \"Banning Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel and Palestine is a sign of enormous disrespect to these elected leaders, to the United States Congress, and to the principles of democracy.\"\n\nIsraeli media reported earlier on discussions of barring the freshman congresswomen due to their support for the anti-Israel BDS movement. Israeli law states that those supporting boycotts of the country may be denied entry. Waivers can be granted for diplomatic figures, however. In July, Israel\u2019s U.S. ambassador said the country would not bar U.S. lawmakers out of \u201crespect\u201d for Congress and Israel\u2019s longtime \u201calliance\u201d with the U.S. Trump expressed frustration about the decision last week, The Washington Post reported.\n\nNetanyahu faced pressure from Democratic leaders and some U.S.-based Israel advocacy groups that were advising against barring the congresswomen, the Post reported. The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday that Netanyahu met Wednesday with Deri, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, National Security Council leader Meir Ben-Shabbat, and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit to discuss the matter. On Thursday, before the formal denial, Israeli Channel 13\u2019s Barak Ravid reported that, according to officials, Netanyahu had been considering allowing Tlaib and Omar to enter Israel, but only to travel within the territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Tlaib and Omar had been scheduled to arrive in Israel on Friday.",
    " Title: FDA Launches Criminal Probe into Vaping-Related Illnesses as Cases Surpass 530\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has initiated a criminal investigation into the recent surge of vaping-related illnesses, which has reached 530 confirmed cases as of September 17, according to health authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported this increase on Thursday, with cases reported in 38 states and one territory.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the CDC reported seven deaths resulting from vaping-related illness, with more expected. By Thursday evening, the Missouri Department of Health confirmed the first death in Missouri, making it the eighth nationwide.\n\nMitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, stated that the criminal probe will not focus on personal vaping-related product use but will investigate the products themselves, their sources, and their usage.\n\nThe cause of the outbreak remains undetermined, with no consistent product, substance, or brand identified in all cases. Most, but not all, patients reported a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, a psychoactive chemical found in cannabis.\n\nThe FDA has collected over 150 vaping product samples for forensic analysis, testing them for traces of nicotine, THC, and other cannabinoids, opioids, cutting agents, additives, pesticides, poisons, toxins, and more. While vitamin E acetate has been found in some samples, no singular compound has been identified in all the samples.\n\nOfficials have warned consumers against purchasing vapes off the street or modifying vape products. Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director at CDC, urged consumers to take these recommendations seriously.\n\nOf the reported cases, about three-fourths of those diagnosed with an illness have been male, slightly over-representative of males in the general vaping population. Young people have been particularly affected, with more than half of the sick being under 25, and 2 out of 3 cases being people between 18 and 34 years old.\n\nIn Illinois, which has seen 69 reported cases and one death, health officials are turning to the public for help in cracking the case. Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for the Illinois Department of Public Health, is asking Illinois residents who have recently vaped to fill out an online, anonymous survey regarding their vaping habits.\n\nAs e-cigarette maker Juul faces lawsuits across the country, politicians, businesses, and individuals are taking action against the vaping industry. A new congressional caucus aimed at curbing the nation's teen-vaping epidemic was announced by U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette (D-CO), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), and Peter King (R-NY) on Thursday.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump announced plans to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in an effort to discourage young people from using e-cigarettes. Michigan became the first state to ban sales of flavored e-cigarettes in stores and online, citing health concerns related to vaping. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for a ban a week later, and other cities are now considering similar measures.\n\nCBS, WarnerMedia, and Viacom announced this week that they will no longer run advertisements for e-cigarettes on their networks. Many young people who previously vaped are taking to social media to warn their peers about the dangers of e-cigarettes, with Miami teen Chance Ammirata, who was hospitalized with a vaping-related illness, posting about his journey with the hashtag \"#lunglove.\"\n\n\"The fight has just begun,\" Ammirata said in a recent post.",
    " Title: European Military Observers Detained in Ukraine Possibly to be Exchanged for Pro-Russian Activists\n\nArticle:\n\nA pro-Russian insurgency leader in eastern Ukraine, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, has suggested that a team of European military observers detained in the region could be released in exchange for jailed pro-Russian activists. Ponomarev, self-proclaimed people's mayor of Slovyansk, a city 90 miles west of Russia, described the detained observers as \"captives.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Ponomarev stated, \"As we found maps on them containing information about the location of our checkpoints, we get the impression that they are officers carrying out a certain spying mission.\"\n\nUkraine's state security service issued a statement Saturday claiming that \"the official representatives of the OSCE are being held in inhuman conditions\" and that \"among those detained is a person who needs immediate medical help,\" according to Russia Today.\n\nThe German-led, eight-member team was traveling under the auspices of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe when they were detained. Germany's Defense Ministry said it had lost contact with the team, which included five Ukrainians.\n\nTim Guldimann, OSCE's special envoy for Ukraine, told German public radio WDR on Saturday that \"efforts are being made to solve this issue.\" He declined to elaborate.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's acting prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, but escalating Ukrainian-Russian tensions prompted him to return home instead of staying for the canonization ceremony on Sunday.\n\nFrancis gave Yatsenyuk a fountain pen, telling him, \"I hope that you write 'peace' with this pen.\"\n\nIn a joint statement released Friday night by the White House, the United States and other nations in the Group of Seven agreed to \"move swiftly\" to impose additional economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. The G-7 nations say they will act urgently to intensify \"targeted sanctions.\" The statement also says the G-7 will continue to prepare broader sanctions on key Russian economic sectors if Moscow takes more aggressive action. The White House says U.S. sanctions could be levied as early as Monday.\n\nFurther details regarding the conditions of the detained observers, the potential prisoner exchange, and the specific actions that prompted the G-7's response were not available in the provided source text.",
    " Title: FBI Investigates \"Targeted Attack\" on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Offices in Texas\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has classified the shooting incident at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices in San Antonio, Texas, as a \"targeted attack.\" Several shots were fired at around 03:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Tuesday, with two neighboring buildings also coming under fire. No injuries were reported, according to the FBI's statement.\n\nThe FBI is currently reviewing surveillance footage as part of its investigation into the shootings. No arrests have been made, and investigators are searching for suspects, according to U.S. media reports.\n\nIn a statement, ICE attributed the shootings to \"political rhetoric\" and \"misinformation\" about the Trump administration's detention policies. ICE, under the Trump administration, has faced heavy criticism for its treatment of undocumented immigrants held at detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nDaniel Bible, ICE's director for San Antonio, stated, \"This disturbing public discourse shrouds our critical law enforcement function and unnecessarily puts our officers' safety at risk.\"\n\nChristopher Combs, head of the FBI's San Antonio operations, described the shootings as \"cowardly, brazen, violent acts.\" He added that those responsible for firing the shots \"did some research\" because they \"knew what floors ICE was on, and they hit those.\"\n\nAccording to Mr. Combs, all the shots found were on the floors where ICE had offices, calling the incident \"a very targeted attack.\" He also noted that, although no one was injured, \"we could be here today talking about the murder of a federal official\" had the bullets \"gone two inches in another direction.\"\n\nBullet holes can be seen in several windows at the buildings located near Brookhaven Drive, north-east San Antonio. A picture tweeted by Ken Cuccinelli, acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, shows a bullet hole in a window at one of the offices targeted.\n\nThe building primarily used for executive and administrative purposes, ICE said. According to the Washington Examiner, the shooting is the latest of four recent attacks at ICE facilities across the country. The three previous incidents occurred in Washington D.C., Tacoma, Washington, and Aurora, Colorado, within days of each other in July, the website reported.\n\nGiven the current climate, FBI investigators fear there could be more attacks, Mr. Combs said. \"We cannot allow political discourse to lead us to the point of violence, where federal employees, innocent people doing their jobs, are put in harm's way,\" he stated.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Announces Conditional Withdrawal from Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has announced that he will withdraw from the Democratic primary if, by the time of the Democratic National Convention, former Vice President Joe Biden has a plurality of delegates. The Democratic primary candidates require a majority (1,991 delegates) to secure the nomination.\n\nProjections indicate that it is unlikely for any candidate to achieve a majority during the primary. If no candidate obtains a majority, the primary proceeds to a second ballot, during which superdelegates can vote. Superdelegates, who make up about 15% of all delegates, include major elected officials, former presidents or vice presidents, and prominent members of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nSanders has stated that he will concede the nomination to Biden, even if Biden only has a plurality, rather than a majority, of delegates. In doing so, Sanders aims to avoid a contested convention, where a person with fewer votes could potentially win the nomination.\n\n\"I think it would be a real, real disaster for the Democratic Party,\" Sanders said of a contested convention. \"People would say 'the person who won the most votes didn't get selected.' Not a good idea.\"\n\nThis decision could be interpreted as Sanders maintaining his dislike of superdelegates and his loyalty to the will of the people. However, it is more likely that Sanders is setting a standard for the convention that he hopes Biden will follow if Sanders enters the convention with a plurality.\n\nCurrently, Biden has 596 delegates, while Sanders has 531. Biden has gained 581 of his 596 delegates in the past seven days with significant wins in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Defines Democratic Socialism as Human Rights, Including Living Wage and Free College Tuition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a CNN town hall speech on Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders outlined his interpretation of democratic socialism, emphasizing human rights such as a living wage and free college tuition for all Americans.\n\n\"When I talk about democratic socialism, what I'm talking about are human rights and economic rights,\" Sanders said.\n\nCNN's Wolf Blitzer, who moderated the event, asked Sanders to respond to President Trump's repeated criticisms of socialism, with the president stating during his State of the Union address earlier this month that \"America will never be a socialist country.\"\n\nSanders responded by stating that the direction of the country is moving towards socialism whether the president approves or not.\n\n\"If I am elected president, we will have a nation in which all people will have health care as a right, whether Trump likes it or not,\" the senator said. \"We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We are going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of at least $15 an hour.\"\n\nSanders continued, \"And whether Trump likes it or not, when I talk about human rights, you know what that also means? It means that our kids and grandchildren have the human right to grow up in a planet that is healthy and habitable.\" He added that it is a disgrace and an embarrassment that the U.S. has a president who rejects science and denies the reality of climate change.\n\nDuring the Q&A, Sanders was asked by a woman in the audience to explain why democratic socialism is preferable to capitalism.\n\n\"Right now we have a nation which prides itself on a lot of political rights,\" Sanders explained.\n\nThe senator stated that while constitutional rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion are \"enormously important,\" it is a problem that there are no economic guarantees.\n\n\"We don't have guarantees regarding economic rights,\" he said. \"We've got to understand that everybody needs a decent paying job, that people need health care, that people need an education... These are not radical ideas.\"\n\n\"So what democratic socialism means to me is having in a civilized society with the understanding that we can make sure that all of our people live in security and in dignity,\" he added.",
    " Title: Cruz and Kasich Announce Strategic Partnership to Block Trump from Reaching 1,237 Delegates\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced their primary strategy on Sunday, a move that both candidates had previously sworn off: an official partnership. The two candidates have agreed to divide some of the remaining primary states and not compete with each other in three states.\n\nSenator Cruz, for example, largely avoided campaigning in New York, where polls showed he was trailing Trump in the run-up to the April 19 primary, and instead looked west to California. Governor Kasich cut his losses in the South, choosing to campaign in Vermont and Massachusetts instead (where he had better poll numbers) the week before South Carolina's primary.\n\nSunday's announcement is a new political twist. Both Cruz and Kasich have released formal statements to clearly share their plan with American voters. Kasich's campaign announced in a press release Sunday night that \"Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland,\" where the Republican National Convention will be held July 18-21. \"We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already,\" the campaign stated, \"and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign\u2019s resources West and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.\"\n\nCruz and Kasich have been fighting for the #NeverTrump vote since the field shrunk to three candidates last month. However, until recently, Cruz was fighting for a conventional nomination, while Kasich has long banked on a contested convention. Now, after the probability of a Cruz pre-convention was shrunk to nearly nil by the New York primary, the two candidates share the same #NeverTrump goal: block Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates before the Republican National Convention in July.\n\n\"Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,\" said Cruz's campaign manager Jeff Roe in a statement Sunday. \"To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.\"\n\nTrump responded to the announcement on Twitter, calling the alliance a \"collusion\" and \"desperation.\"\n\nWhile Cruz and Kasich's strategy is surprising\u2014and a first for modern presidential elections\u2014their specific allocation of Indiana, Oregon, and New Mexico might be perplexing. The choice of these three states can't be defended by primary dates. Five Northeastern states hold primaries on Tuesday. Indiana's Republican primary is on May 3, followed by Nebraska and West Virginia before Oregon's primary on May 17. And New Mexico's primary occurs on the last primary voting day for Republicans, June 7.\n\nThese three states are not exactly rich with delegates. Indiana has 57 delegates up for grabs, which is not insubstantial but is also less than Pennsylvania's 71 the week before. And on Kasich's end of the agreement, he is looking to gain Oregon's 28 delegates and New Mexico's 24. Of the five GOP primaries on June 7, New Mexico has the least amount of delegates, led by California's 172 delegates and New Jersey's 51.\n\nInstead, the Cruz-Kasich alliance highlights the importance of Indiana. This late in the race, with Trump so close to 1,237, Indiana's 57 delegates could be a game changer. A Cruz win in Indiana is the best prospect for a contested convention.\n\n\"[Indiana] is likely to be the biggest battleground in coming weeks, given both the closeness of the race and the huge haul of delegates,\" explains Politico's Shane Goldmacher last week. \"If Trump is to get to 1,237 delegates, he would likely need to win Indiana. Without it, his best mathematical alternative would be either to flip a likely Cruz state\u2014Montana or South Dakota\u2014or to sweep almost all 172 of California's delegates, a tall task.\"\n\nDespite a polling blackout in Indiana because of a state law that prohibits automated polling, it's looking like a good state for Cruz. The Upshot's demographic-based model has Cruz leading Trump 43 to 40 percent with Kasich trailing at 16 percent. And two anonymous polling groups told Politico last week that Cruz and Trump were in a statistical tie, both with 32 percent. Giving Oregon to Kasich also makes sense for the #NeverTrump duo, as early polls predict Kasich winning that primary over Cruz and Trump.\n\n\"It may sound strange,\" adds The New York Times' Nate Cohn, \"but when you start gaming out the rest of the primary contest, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that [Trump's] quest to reach a majority of delegates before the convention could all turn on Indiana.\" \"If you divvy up the states by expected results,\" he continues, \"Mr. Trump wins big in the East and West Virginia, loses the winner-take-all rural Western states, and earns his expected share of proportional delegates in Washington, Oregon, and New Mexico.\"\n\nThis puts Trump 175 delegates short of the nomination. If Kasich needs a contested convention for a chance to win the presidential election, and Cruz winning Indiana is the best chance for a contested convention, then giving Indiana to Cruz is the best option for both sides of the #NeverTrump fight.",
    " Title: President Obama Meets with Labor Leaders to Discuss Fiscal Cliff Avoidance\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama convened with labor leaders at the White House on Tuesday, marking the first of several meetings aimed at preventing automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect at the beginning of the new year. The meetings follow Obama's re-election last week, and the question now is whether the president can translate his electoral success into policy-shaping achievements.\n\nThe 62 million Americans who voted to re-elect Obama in 2012 are aware that he seeks to impose higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans. This stance was made clear during stalled budget negotiations with congressional Republicans last year and throughout the lengthy presidential campaign.\n\nDuring his victory celebration in Chicago last week, former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, now the city's mayor, suggested that the election results could pave the way for the kind of compromise President Clinton achieved with a Republican Congress when he was re-elected in 1996.\n\nSince the election, Republican House Speaker John Boehner has shown some willingness to collect more tax revenue from the wealthy, provided it can be done without raising tax rates. Obama has expressed encouragement over Boehner's newfound flexibility, but he is not passively waiting for congressional Republicans to align with the majority of voters' views.\n\nObama stated during an interview with Univision in late September that public pressure from outside Washington can be an essential tool in moving a reluctant Congress. He suggested he might turn to the public more frequently in the future to exert such pressure.\n\nThe president noted that maintaining voters' attention during a lengthy debate over tax policy can be challenging, as he discovered during his first term when he abandoned his pledge to hold health care talks on national television. However, Obama expressed determination to engage more consistently with the American people during his second term.\n\nObama told voters in Ohio shortly before Election Day that their involvement is crucial for the democratic process to function effectively. This week's meetings with labor leaders and CEOs are part of Obama's efforts to gather support as he enters negotiations with Congress, and not just from his grassroots supporters who carried him to a second term.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Orders Public Schools to Comply with Transgender Students' Facility Access\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has announced that it will send a decree to all U.S. public schools, requiring them to allow transgender students access to facilities consistent with their gender identity. This move escalates the ongoing national debate on LGBT rights, sparked by North Carolina's controversial \"bathroom bill.\"\n\nThe Justice Department and the Department of Education will send the decree, a copy of which was obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, on Friday. The letter provides guidelines to school districts across the country on how to protect transgender students from discrimination.\n\nThe letter, first reported by the New York Times, states that schools have legal obligations to protect transgender students and risk federal funding if they do not comply. The letter does not add new legal requirements but offers extensive guidelines on ensuring fair treatment and appropriate facility access for trans students.\n\nThe letter states, \"A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity.\" It also specifies that transgender students cannot be required to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so.\n\nThe notice also makes clear that transgender students must have access to facilities \"even in circumstances in which other students, parents, or community members raise objections or concerns.\" It further states, \"As is consistently recognized in civil rights cases, the desire to accommodate others\u2019 discomfort can not justify a policy that singles out and disadvantages a particular class of students.\"\n\nA lengthy document attached to the letter provides examples of policies and emerging practices for supporting transgender students and offers guidelines on privacy, confidentiality, anti-bullying, and other issues affecting LGBT students.\n\nU.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch said in a statement, \"There is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex.\" She added, \"This guidance gives administrators, teachers, and parents the tools they need to protect transgender students from peer harassment and to identify and address unjust school policies.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as the justice department and North Carolina move forward with a high-profile legal battle over the state's bathroom law. Lynch has stated that the law amounts to \"state-sponsored discrimination\" and has caused transgender people to suffer \"emotional harm, mental anguish, distress, humiliation, and indignity.\"\n\nThe law, HB2, effectively forces trans people to use restrooms that correspond to the sex assigned to them at birth, which critics say is unenforceable and a clear violation of the US Civil Rights Act. It also blocks cities from passing local anti-discrimination laws aimed at protecting LGBT people.\n\nRepublican Governor of North Carolina, Pat McCrory, has defended the law as a privacy measure, accusing the federal government of a \"baseless and blatant overreach\" of its power. The state risks losing as much as $4.8bn in government funding by refusing to repeal the law.\n\nThe fight over trans rights extends beyond North Carolina. A federal appeals court in Virginia recently ruled that barring a transgender boy from using the boys' bathroom was a civil rights violation, and school officials in Chicago and Oregon have recently outlined protections for trans students.",
    " Title: House and Senate Face Impasse as Fiscal Cliff Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a high-level telephone conference call, House Republican leaders have called on the Senate to act and have indicated a willingness to bring any last-minute legislation the Senate produces to the House floor. The statement, issued on behalf of Speaker John A. Boehner and his three top lieutenants, states that the House will take action on any Senate-passed legislation, but the Senate must act first.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, however, has called on House Republicans to pass an existing Senate measure that would prevent tax increases on household income up to $250,000. In a statement, Reid criticized House Republicans for their \"Tea Party bills\" and accused them of obstruction.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, Senators will return to the Capitol with no immediate legislation to consider. The House is scheduled to be gaveled into session at 2 p.m., but since Speaker Boehner has not called the members back to Washington, it is likely to be gaveled back into recess shortly thereafter.\n\nThe focus has shifted to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a deal-making veteran. Democrats are seeking assurances from McConnell that he will not use procedural tactics to delay any potential bill for an interim solution to avert the fiscal crisis.\n\nDon Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, stated that no one from the White House or from Reid's office has reached out to begin negotiations. Democrats argue that McConnell is well aware of their proposed solution: the same Senate bill that passed in July, which extends all the expiring Bush-era income tax cuts on incomes below $250,000, sets the tax rate on dividends and capital gains at 20 percent, and stops the alternative minimum tax from rising to hit more middle-class taxpayers. Democrats also propose adding an extension of expiring unemployment benefits and a delay in across-the-board spending cuts while negotiations on a broader deficit reduction plan slip into next year.\n\nDemocrats now suggest that Republicans are content to wait until after the January deadline. On Jan. 3, Boehner is likely to be re-elected speaker for the 113th Congress. After that roll call, he may feel less pressure from his right flank against a deal.\n\nThe Senate may simply be out of time. Without unanimous agreement, Reid would have to take procedural steps to begin considering a bill. He could then be forced to press for another vote to cut off debate before final passage. If forced to jump through those hoops, the 112th Congress could expire before final votes could be cast.\n\nRepresentative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, said on CNBC on Wednesday, \"I think there's some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of January, which technically means you're going over the cliff.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties suggest that McConnell could be the key to a resolution. He has played the role of adjudicator for Congressional Republicans before, during last year's fight over a payroll tax extension and the battle between Democrats and Republicans over how, or if, to pay for an emergency disaster financing bill.\n\nWith days to spare, McConnell must decide whether to allow on the Senate floor the Democrats' bill to extend expiring tax cuts. If passed without a filibuster, that legislation could force the House speaker's hand and quiet his raucous Republican conference. Alternatively, McConnell, who is up for re-election in 2014 and would like to avoid a primary fight, could stand back quietly and hope that Boehner and President Obama somehow manage to put together a deal that saves him the trouble.\n\nIf McConnell cannot come to the rescue, there is another hope: Starbucks. Howard Schultz, the company's chief executive officer, asked baristas who work in Washington-area Starbucks to scrawl \"Come Together\" on coffee cups for the rest of the week to generate enthusiasm for a compromise.",
    " Title: Online Donations Fuel Democratic House Campaigns, Countering GOP Advertising Assault\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of thousands of online donors are contributing substantial amounts of money to Democratic House campaigns at an increasing rate, countering a late-summer advertising offensive by the Republicans that aims to preserve their majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nRepublicans have traditionally relied on their outside-money advantage in the battle for the House, with the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) pledging to spend $100 million in 2018. The super PAC's strategy is to attack Democrats early and often, launching a series of TV attack ads in 15 districts before Labor Day. However, the influx of online money to Democratic candidates has allowed them to air their own TV ads earlier than ever, blunting the GOP's game plan.\n\nAccording to a review of TV spending totals shared with \u2588\u2588\u2588, Democrats in nearly 20 districts aired TV ads first to define themselves before facing GOP attacks, while CLF went on the offensive first in seven districts. The sustained cash flow has extended Democrats' already formidable edge in the fight for control of the House. Democratic House candidates raised more than $35.8 million online in August, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of Federal Election Commission data from ActBlue, the Democratic online fundraising platform. This is nearly six times the amount raised online by House Democrats in August 2016, during the last election.\n\nThe gains have been broadly distributed: 14 Democratic challengers raised at least half a million dollars via ActBlue in August, while another 38 brought in at least $250,000 online.\n\n\"For a number of years, Democrats searched for our answer to the Koch brothers and found our own billionaire,\" said Jesse Ferguson, a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staffer and Democratic consultant. \"In reality, it's a 67-year-old grandmother on a fixed income who's donating $25 every month to candidates.\"\n\nAmong those leading the way was Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer running in Virginia who raised $790,000 online in August. Spanberger saw a fundraising spike after it was revealed that CLF had obtained her confidential security clearance application while conducting research on her employment history, according to her campaign.\n\nBy the time CLF used the information to attack Spanberger on TV on Sept. 6, the Democrat had already aired nearly 900 positive TV spots in her race against GOP Rep. Dave Brat, according to data from Advertising Analytics.\n\n\"Our ads helped set the baseline of who I am, and that was probably very helpful in combating those attacks,\" Spanberger said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"The juxtaposition of the visuals of the ads, ours showing me as a normal person and theirs, are just scary.\"\n\nCLF has continued its attacks with more TV ads, highlighting Spanberger's stint as a substitute teacher at the Saudi-funded Islamic Saudi Academy in Mount Vernon, Va., and calling it \"Terror High.\" A Republican familiar with polling in the district said that \"the race was trending in the wrong direction, and that ad helped stabilize things.\"\n\nCLF spokeswoman Courtney Alexander said Democrats have been \"forced to spend whatever they have raised responding to attack ads which are putting Democratic candidates on defense and setting the terms of these races,\" adding that \"no first-time candidate wants their first ad to be a response ad, and that's what we have seen repeatedly from Democrats across the country as they are forced to scramble to answer for their records as the truth comes out.\"\n\nSpanberger called the ads \"ridiculous,\" adding that the attack has \"fallen flat.\" She's just one of many Democrats bringing in big money and pouring it right back into mass communication with voters. Overall, ActBlue\u2014which surpassed $1 billion raised in 2018 on Aug. 2\u2014had its biggest month ever in August, bringing in $100 million to candidates and progressive organizations. Other top House fundraisers that month included Sharice Davids, who raised over $782,000 online for her campaign against Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), and Jared Golden, who brought in over $729,000 online for his campaign against Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine).\n\nThe money came after months of groundwork by campaigns and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The DCCC placed digital staffers in each of its regional political teams for the first time this election, according to a DCCC aide, helping campaigns grow online and be prepared to capitalize on viral moments and other opportunities.\n\nThe resulting well-funded campaigns have put House Democrats in an unusual position: They and their allied outside groups are currently outadvertising the GOP in some battlegrounds.\n\n\"Candidates and Democratic groups have been running even or we have an advantage in paid communications on the air in many of the top 25 to 30 districts across the country,\" said Charlie Kelly, executive director of House Majority PAC, the Democratic House super PAC. \"Time and time again, Democratic enthusiasm is off the charts.\"\n\nThese August online fundraising totals track with Democratic candidate performance over the past year. A whopping 56 Republican House incumbents raised less money than their Democratic challengers during the second quarter, along with 16 congressmen with less cash on hand than their Democratic opponents.\n\n\"This is the manifestation of a larger problem\u2014the massive enthusiasm gap,\" said one Republican consultant working on House races, granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"Republicans and our outside groups are raising a lot of money, too, but we can no longer say or think we can rely on just our super PACs, because now Democrats have money as well. Everyone has money.\"\n\nBut the money is no guarantee of success. Amy McGrath, a former combat pilot who's challenging Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), also caught fire online early by telling a compelling personal story in TV ads. Her first campaign video has received nearly 2 million views on YouTube, and public polling shows the first-time candidate jumped ahead in public polling.\n\nHowever, CLF aired TV ads featuring a clip of McGrath saying, \"I don't know that I'm different than the Democratic Party nationally,\" then cut to a voter saying, \"When I first saw Amy McGrath's ads, I thought she was a moderate, but now we know the truth.\"\n\nCLF released a polling memo earlier this month, showing that an early lead built by McGrath had evaporated. (A recent poll conducted by The New York Times also shows a tied race.) \"Now, 66 percent of voters see her as a liberal, compared to 39 percent in June,\" the CLF polling memo reads.",
    " Title: West Hollywood Council Votes to Urge Removal of Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame Star\n\nArticle:\n\nThe West Hollywood City Council has voted unanimously to urge the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove U.S. President Donald Trump's star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The vote, which took place on Monday evening, is largely symbolic as the council has no jurisdiction over the Walk of Fame, which is located in neighboring Hollywood.\n\nThe resolution, announced by West Hollywood Mayor John Duran, states that the man honored by the star does not reflect the values of West Hollywood, one of the country's most liberal corners. The resolution cites allegations by several women who claim that Trump sexually harassed them, which he has denied, and points out his policy of separating asylum-seeking migrant families at the U.S. border with Mexico, a policy that was recently scrapped.\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has never removed a star from the Walk of Fame, which honors celebrities from the entertainment industry. In a statement, Leron Gubler, the chamber president, said there are no plans to remove any stars from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The council's request will be considered at the chamber's next meeting, he said.\n\nTrump's star was added in 2007 in recognition of his television work prior to his entry into politics, including his hosting of the NBC show \"The Apprentice\" and his producing of the Miss Universe beauty pageants. The star has become the setting for various anti-Trump protests since Trump announced his presidential run in 2015, and has been vandalized twice by men with heavy tools, only to be swiftly repaired.",
    " Title: Top 24 Politically Correct Moments of the Decade: A Review\n\nArticle:\n\nThe following is a list, in no particular order, of 24 notable instances of politically correct moments that have occurred in the last decade. These instances highlight various cultural, social, and educational trends that have emerged in response to perceived insensitivities and microaggressions.\n\n1. A college diversity-training course taught that it was culturally insensitive to expect people to be on time, as \"time may be considered fluid\" in other cultures.\n2. A piece in Everyday Feminism argued that the term \"trigger warning\" could be re-traumatizing for individuals who have experienced military, police, or other forms of violence, and suggested using \"content warning\" instead.\n3. A Brooklyn College of City University of New York professor was accused of sexual harassment for stating that effort was 10 percent of the grade.\n4. A campus survey included a trigger warning to caution college students that it may contain \"anatomical names of body parts.\"\n5. University researchers demanded that people accept those who \"identify as real vampires\" to prevent anti-vampire discrimination.\n6. A Seattle-area councilman was concerned about the city hosing poop off of its sidewalks because he thought that it might seem too racially insensitive.\n7. A bathing-suit advertisement was criticized for being \"sexist\" because it depicted a woman in a bathing suit.\n8. Some feminists decided that \"pussyhats\" were both racist and transphobic, due to the fact that not all women have vaginas, and not all vaginas are pink.\n9. A professor claimed that the small chairs in preschools are sexist, \"disempowering,\" and \"problematic.\"\n10. College students decided against bringing a camel to school for a \"Hump Day\" event, due to concerns about racism.\n11.

Lecturers were warned that capital letters might scare students and that they should avoid using them.\n16. A campus-wide email told white students to stop wearing hooped earrings, because doing so was cultural appropriation.\n17. A campus Christian club was found guilty of discrimination for requiring its leaders to be Christians.\n18. Oxford University law students were told that they didn't have to learn about rape or violence law if they found it too triggering.\n19. Undergraduate law students were reportedly allowed to leave during any lessons about such material if they felt uncomfortable.\n20. A liberal author demanded that \"normal people\" avoid wearing any kind of red hat, because all red hats can be too scary.\n21. A piece in The New York Times argued that the adverb \"very\" has \"deprived\" \"most women\" \"of self-satisfaction and appreciation.\"\n22. A liberal author demanded that \"normal people\" avoid wearing any kind of red hat, because all red hats can be too scary.\n23. Evergreen State University told professors to take student protesters' feelings into account when grading them.\n24. Several colleges and universities either canceled or adapted performances of The Vagina Monologues over concerns about excluding women without vaginas or due to the fact that a white lady wrote it. One school, Southwestern University in Texas, canceled theirs for another reason: because a white lady wrote it.",
    " Title: Egypt Launches Airstrikes Against ISIS in Libya in Response to Execution of Coptic Christians\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt has launched a series of airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) targets in Libya in response to the execution of 21 Coptic Christian citizens by the extremist group. The airstrikes, announced on state radio on Monday, targeted ISIS's weapons caches, training grounds, and camps in Libya.\n\nThe airstrikes were described as a means of \"avenge[ing] the bloodshed and to seek retribution from the killers.\" Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi vowed revenge for the execution, which was captured in a five-minute propaganda video released on Sunday.\n\nIn the video, the Coptic Christians from Egypt are paraded onto a beach, each accompanied by a masked jihadist. They are then forced to kneel as one jihadist addresses the camera in English. \"All crusaders: safety for you will be only wishes, especially if you are fighting us all together,\" he says. \"Therefore we will fight you all together.\"\n\nThe Egyptians are then forced to lay face-down in the sand and are simultaneously beheaded. The same jihadist speaker then points to the sea and says, \"We will conquer Rome, by Allah's permission.\"\n\nThe men were not in Libya to fight ISIS. Rather, they were in the country to make a living when they were kidnapped in two separate incidents in December and January from the city of Sirte.\n\nIn addition to Egypt's airstrikes, Libya's air force also carried out its own airstrikes in the eastern city of Darna, which an ISIS affiliate took over last year. According to Libyan air force commander Saqer al-Joroushi, there were casualties among individuals, ammunition, and ISIS communication centers. He also reported that roughly 40 to 50 militants were killed.\n\nFurther airstrikes are planned for today and tomorrow in coordination with Egypt, according to al-Joroushi. The Associated Press reports that Egypt has already carried out a second wave of airstrikes in Darna.",
    " Title: Covington Catholic Student Nick Sandmann Defends Actions During Controversial Confrontation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with NBC's \"Today,\" Nick Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student at the center of a controversial confrontation with Native American activist Nathan Phillips, defended his actions during the incident.\n\nAccording to Sandmann, both he and Phillips were exercising their First Amendment rights during the confrontation that took place on Friday. Videos from the incident show that another protest group, the Black Hebrew Israelites, had been taunting the Covington Catholic students. Phillips and his group approached the boys, stopping in front of Sandmann.\n\nSandmann stated that the students had received permission from chaperones to shout school chants to drown out the insults from the Black Hebrew Israelites. He felt threatened, despite being in a much larger group, as the protesters were adults, and he \"wasn't sure what was going to happen.\"\n\n\"In hindsight, I wish we had just found another spot to wait for our buses, but at the time, being positive seemed better than letting them slander us with all of these things,\" Sandmann said.\n\nIn other interviews, Phillips explained that he went toward the boys to defuse what he saw as a tense situation between the Black Hebrew Israelites and the students.\n\nSandmann also stated that his group should have walked away once the Native American activists came to them, but he \"didn't want to be disrespectful to Mr. Phillips\" if he was trying to have a conversation.\n\nSandmann, who can be seen staring back at Phillips with what some have described as a smirk in the videos, said he was not intending to be disrespectful. In his view, he was trying to show that he wouldn't be moved to \"any further reaction of aggression.\"\n\n\"As far as standing there, I had every right to do so,\" he said. \"I can't say that I'm sorry for listening to him and standing there.\"\n\nPhillips, who has done several interviews since the incident went viral, disputes Sandmann's version of events. He contends that Sandmann locked eyes with him and approached him.\n\n\"I have read the statement from Nick Sandmann, the student who stared at me for a long time. He did not apologize, and I believe there are intentional falsehoods in his testimony,\" Phillips said.\n\nCovington Catholic High, an all-boys school, closed on Tuesday for safety reasons and reopened on Wednesday, although parents do not have to send their sons to school for the time being. The details of the school's reopening plan were not available in the provided text.",
    " Title: Nepal's Muslim Community Faces Rise in Islamophobia Amid Indian Hindu Nationalist Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nNepal, a country with a Muslim population of approximately 4 percent, has historically maintained peaceful coexistence with its Hindu majority. However, recent events suggest a rise in Islamophobia, allegedly fueled by India's Hindu nationalist fundamentalists and Islamophobic media.\n\nThe Indian government's shift towards Hindu nationalism, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh organization, has reportedly strengthened the New Delhi establishment's efforts to remake Nepal as a predominantly Hindu nation. In 2006, Nepal became a secular country after the ousting of the old constitutional monarchy, aided by a more secular Indian government that helped former Maoist rebels to a peace deal and into mainstream politics.\n\nHowever, the spread of Islamophobia in Nepal has been facilitated by the large number of Hindi speakers and the wide range of Indian TV available. A series of incidents in April 2021, exacerbated by yellow journalism in Nepal, have led to the rapid spread of nasty rumors.\n\nOn April 16, a few rupee bills were found scattered in Janakpur, southern Nepal. A claim that two Muslim women had scattered the bills after spitting on them spread quickly, based on a CCTV video that showed the bills dropping out of their pockets. Islamophobic posts claiming the women had deliberately spit on the bills to spread the coronavirus went viral.\n\nThe police tested the two women for COVID-19, and the initial quick test produced a positive result from one of the women. This sparked further hateful posts, but it later turned out that the test had been wrong, and further testing gave negative results. In reality, the two women had just returned from the bank and had dropped the notes accidentally.\n\nA week earlier, on April 10, India's right-wing media, particularly Hindi news channels, circulated sensationalized news that Pakistan might have sent coronavirus-infected Muslim men to India via Nepal. They coined a new term: \"corona-jihad.\" The claims were based on an unverified and largely unsourced report sent by the state of Bihar to the Indian Home Ministry, which included false claims that Jalim Miya, a Muslim politician in Nepal, was behind the supposed plot and that the group of men were taking paracetamol to suppress their fevers and pass undetected. Miya explained exasperatedly that there was no such plot and was backed by Nepal's central government.\n\nNepal's Muslims are concerned about the rise in Islamophobia but hope their friends and neighbors will stop things from getting worse. They point to the failure of the 1992 riots around the destruction of the Babri Masjid, a mosque built on a site also revered by Hindus in Ayodhya, India, to spread over the border. However, there has been a steady rise in attacks against Nepali Muslims on social media. The majority of Nepalis, however, continue to reject the attempts to whip up hatred, and there have been no reported physical assaults on Muslims.\n\nHajji Abdullah Miya, a former member of the Hajj Committee of Nepal, told a local media outlet, \"Especially after the rise of Modi, the attitude towards Muslims in India has changed. In any case, the general tendency to portray Muslims negatively is old in India. India used to spread rumors against the Muslims of Nepal to create animosity with the Indian Muslims. Whether in the name of mosques and madrassas in the Terai border region or on other issues, India has always attacked Nepali Muslims.\"\n\nAs Nepal continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hindu nationalist agenda from India is likely to persist. The hashtag #RIPIndianMedia trended in Nepal, reflecting the damage done to the image of Indian media in the country. Yet, even Nepali journalists, online news portals, and the public have engaged in Islamophobic posts and tweets, contributing to the viral spread of #IslamophobiaInNepal.",
    " Title: Kashmiri Boy's Death Acknowledged Four Months After Abrogation of Article 370\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Indian-administered Kashmir, the family of 17-year-old Osaib Altaf Marazi, who was found dead in the Jhelum river on August 5, 2019, has struggled for five months to prove his death and secure a death certificate. Osaib's death was the first reported in the wake of the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which granted special status to the Muslim-majority region.\n\nOn the day of the abrogation, roads across Kashmir were blocked, and checkpoints manned by Indian paramilitary forces were set up. A tense atmosphere descended upon the region as phone networks, internet services, and TV channels were blocked to prevent Kashmiris from protesting against New Delhi's decision to scrap Kashmir's limited autonomy.\n\nOsaib's older brother, Suhail Ahmad Marazi, was not home on August 5. He later gathered witness accounts of what happened to his brother in the moments before his death. According to Suhail, Osaib was with his friends and together they walked a short distance from their home in Palpora village on the outskirts of Srinagar when they were surrounded by paramilitary forces.\n\n\"They were 10 boys. As they reached the middle of a footbridge, they saw CRPF personnel running after them from both sides. They were scared and jumped into the river,\" Suhail told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"The other boys who were present at the spot told us that Osaib held onto the edge of the bridge for a few seconds before the armed men hit him with a stick on his head and hands and he slipped into the waters.\"\n\nAt home, Saleema was doing chores when boys from the neighborhood came running and knocked at her window. \"They said Osaib had been martyred,\" Saleema recalled, overcome by emotion. \"I wait for him every day and call his name every time when I serve the dinner. He was afraid to sleep alone.\"\n\nOsaib's body was handed over to the family for burial, but the hospital refused to issue a death certificate. Officials at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital in Srinagar asked the Marazi family for a First Information Report (FIR), a police complaint, to certify Osaib's death.\n\n\"From the hospital, I went to one police station and then another, and both said that they will not be able to register the FIR as the area does not come under their jurisdiction,\" Suhail said. \"It was a helpless situation.\"\n\nIn September, after two child rights activists, Enakshi Ganguly and Shanta Sinha, filed a petition in India's Supreme Court to investigate cases of rights violations involving children in Kashmir, the court tasked the juvenile justice committee with investigating cases involving minors who were being detained in the region.\n\nIn the midst of their struggle to prove Osaib's death, his family was shocked by a written submission by police to the juvenile justice committee admitting that they had detained 144 minors.\n\n\"Osaib Altaf, the incident as reported has been found to be baseless as no such death has been reported to the police authorities as per verification report received from the field formations,\" the police report said.\n\nThe family then approached the lower court to request the FIR. \"We approached the court because how can they deny our child's death?\" Suhail Marazi said. \"While we were mourning at home, every week we had to go to the court as well.\"\n\nLast month, the police finally submitted a report to the court admitting Osaib's death by drowning. \"It is prayed that on 05-08-2019, the deceased Osaib Marazi aged about 24 years allegedly drowned in river Jhelum,\" said the status report submitted by the Parimpora police station to the court. Osaib's school records show he was 17, not \"about 24\" as the police claimed. He was a grade 12 student at a local school.\n\n\"No one gets justice here, and we do not hope for it either. But we want that we should be provided the death certificate,\" said Suhail, adding that they will continue to fight for the certificate. \"Our neighbor Danish was killed the same way in 2016, and even they did not get any justice. They [the police] have found a new way to kill children in Kashmir.\"\n\nAuthorities in Kashmir, who now come directly under India's interior ministry, have denied any killings took place in the wake of the August 5 decision. However, local human rights group Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) said, in its 2019 human rights review, that six civilians had been killed by the Indian armed forces.\n\nOne of the civilians was 17-year-old Asrar Firdous Khan from Soura, Srinagar, who was playing cricket with his friends on August 6 when soldiers shot him in the head several times with pellets, according to his family. Asrar's medical records showed his death occurred due to pellet injuries to his skull, but the police refuted that, saying he was killed when a stone was thrown at him. The police did not specify who threw the stone.\n\nWhile Osaib's family continues to struggle for acknowledgement of his death, Saleema struggles with her pain and longing. \"I want to tear my heart open to find my son. It seems the light of my eyes has gone away.\"",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign Denies Access to Print Pool Reporter, Stirring Transparency Concerns\n\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign has faced criticism for denying access to a print pool reporter on Monday, reigniting concerns about the campaign's commitment to transparency. David Martosko, the U.S. political editor for London's Daily Mail, was denied access to the campaign's events in New Hampshire.\n\nMartosko reported arriving at the campaign's breakfast stop only to be told he would not be allowed to pool the day's events. Pool reporters are responsible for sending reports from the trail to the rest of the press corps. According to Martosko, he was told, \"So I'm afraid it's a no. You're not on the list.\"\n\nWhen asked if the print pooler was being prohibited from getting on either of the pool vans, the campaign's press aide replied, \"I'm afraid that's right.\" When asked why, she responded, \"All I know is what Harrell has told me. I got an email saying the print pooler would be changed for today. Sorry.\"\n\nDenied a ride in the pool van, Martosko decided to drive to the first campaign stop in Rochester on his own. However, he was not admitted to the event's location, the YMCA of Strafford County, despite being sent back multiple times. It is unclear who denied him entry, but it is reported that the head of Clinton's Secret Service detail expressed disapproval upon learning of Martosko's presence.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has not responded to requests for comment regarding the incident. The campaign's traveling press secretary, Nick Merrill, provided an explanation to Martosko, who relayed it in a report on The Daily Mail's website. Merrill stated that the campaign's position is that the Daily Mail does not qualify because it has not yet been added to the White House's regular print pool.\n\nMerrill added that the campaign is \"trying to follow the same process and system the White House has.\" He also stated that the decision had \"nothing to do\" with the campaign considering the Daily Mail foreign press and that the campaign does not consider the Daily Mail foreign press.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has not commented further on the incident, but Merrill later insisted that his reasons were not based on the foreign-press question, but that the campaign simply wanted a day to \"have a conversation\" about how to proceed. The campaign stated that they are working to create an equitable system and have had concerns expressed by foreign outlets about not being a part of the rotation.",
    " Title: Fox News Analyst Discusses Shift in Mueller Investigation Focus to Clinton Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday, during Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" network senior political contributor Brit Hume reacted to Tucker Carlson's earlier report suggesting that the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller has expanded to include elements of Hillary Clinton's campaign and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential opponent. Hume stated that this could change the focus and character of the probe, potentially implicating long-time Washington, D.C. Democrats.\n\nCarlson questioned Hume about the implications of Paul Manafort's work for the Podesta Group, representing Russian interests before joining the Trump campaign. Hume noted that the Podesta brothers, Tony and John, are central figures in the Democratic Party and Clinton's political endeavors.\n\nCarlson expressed surprise that, despite Manafort's work for the Podesta Group, this connection had not been discovered by other news organizations during the past 11 months. Hume suggested that the quality of journalism may have been a factor in this oversight, as well as the journalists' focus on a specific storyline.\n\nHume also discussed the broadened scope of Mueller's investigation, which is now reportedly investigating the extent and depth of Russian efforts to influence American policy for several years. He noted that if the information about the Podestas is accurate, it could be disappointing for Democrats, who have been vocal about Russian interference in the election.\n\nCarlson and Hume also discussed the Uranium One matter, suggesting that the Obama administration's efforts to seek a closer relationship with Russia may have put American security at risk. They also mentioned that the information comprising the now-famous dossier, which was published by BuzzFeed, was reportedly paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.\n\nHume concluded that the tide may be turning in the political and journalistic landscape, as more information about the Clinton campaign's connections to Russia comes to light. He also expressed concern for the Podestas in light of these revelations.",
    " Title: Sanders, Buttigieg, and Warren Lead in New Hampshire Primary; Biden, Warren Face Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the New Hampshire primary, Bernie Sanders emerged as the winner, bolstered by strong performances in the state's largest cities. He led his main rivals in Manchester by over 2,000 votes, and in Concord and Nashua by 500 votes each. Pete Buttigieg performed well in communities south of Manchester, in Boston suburbs, and in college towns such as Hanover, home of Dartmouth College.\n\nJoe Biden, who was once the national front-runner, finished fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire. Elizabeth Warren, the neighboring state's senator who claimed almost a third of the Democratic vote in an October poll, edged out Biden for fourth place by less than a percentage point.\n\nSanders, who garnered more than a third of the votes among those who preferred a candidate who agreed with them on major issues, and three times as many votes among those who supported replacing America's health care system with a single-payer plan, now faces an 11-day slog to the next contest in Nevada and an 18-day wait for the South Carolina primary. Both Sanders and Warren will have to convince donors and supporters they can regroup and rebuild their campaigns to secure a win.\n\nThere were troubling signs for both Biden and Warren in Tuesday's outcome. Warren, who is known for her detailed policy plans, struggled among those who prioritized electability over plans. Among the 33% of voters who preferred a candidate who agreed with them on major issues, more than a third chose Sanders, and only a small fraction chose Warren. Among the three in five voters who supported replacing America's health care system with a single-payer plan, three times as many chose Sanders over Warren.\n\nBoth Biden and Warren took steps Tuesday to distance themselves from the New Hampshire results, even before the polls closed. Warren stayed in New Hampshire to concede, offering kind words to Amy Klobuchar and pledging to fight on. In a memo to supporters, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote that Warren's candidate remains \"the consensus choice of the widest coalition of Democrats in every corner of the country.\" He stated that Warren's formidable campaign organization was poised to win delegates across most of the states and districts that will vote on Super Tuesday, and that her ceiling is higher than Biden's, Sanders's, or Buttigieg's.\n\nEach campaign will now have to convince its chief supporters that its candidate still has a path to the 1,990 delegates necessary to win the convention. Without the support necessary to sustain national field organizations and seven-figure television budgets, any candidate's campaign withers and dies; when a candidate loses or falls short of expectations, those financial problems mount even more rapidly.\n\nWarren, too, faces the challenge of breaking through for the first time. She does not lead in polls in Nevada, South Carolina, or most Super Tuesday states\u2014the last poll she led was an October WBUR-MassInc survey of her home state's voters\u2014and it is unclear where she will secure her first win.\n\n\"The road to the Democratic nomination is not paved with statewide winner-take-all victories. This is not a race for governor, the U.S. Senate, or the state treasurer's office,\" Lau wrote in his memo. \"This is a district-by-district contest for pledged delegates awarded proportionally.\"",
    " Title: The Evolution of Census-Taking: From Ancient Arrowheads to Modern Data Collection\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is currently conducting its population census, a once-a-decade effort to count every individual residing within its borders. Over 150 other countries will join in this world census round, centered on 2020, with around 90 percent of the world's population already counted.\n\nWhile the modern census may seem unspectacular in terms of technology, the American questionnaire asks just seven questions of each person, with a few additional questions for each household as a whole. This amounts to approximately 45 GB of data for the entire U.S. population, a volume that could be carried on a base model iPhone 11 if it weren't for the strict confidentiality.\n\nThe challenges of this year's census are significant, but they are social, political, logistical, and now public-health related, rather than strictly technological or scientific. However, census-taking was not always this straightforward. For centuries, counting its people was one of the most technologically complex procedures a state could undertake.\n\nCensus-taking likely arose independently in many places, and it is not possible to point to a first census. Although writing is now integral to data recording, analysis, and reporting, census-taking certainly predated it. An early example can be found in the story of the Scythians, nomadic warriors who lived in Central Asia in the first millennium BCE. To count his people, their king, Ariantas, had each Scythian bring an arrowhead. The number of arrowheads was then counted to determine the population size.\n\nProto-literate societies could conduct censuses of great complexity. The Inca, who dominated Andean America at the time of the Spanish conquest in the 15th century CE, recorded elaborate census statistics in connection with taxation, despite lacking what we would recognize as writing. Instead, they used knots tied in complex bundles of colored strings called khipu to encode information. Of the thousand khipu that exist in museums today, two-thirds contain numerical data, and at least 50 are thought to pertain to censuses.\n\nThe most important ancient census, from a modern perspective, was surely that of Rome. Romans adopted the census late in the city's regal period, shortly before the more familiar republic was declared in 509 BCE. They gave the procedure the name we now use (from the Latin ce\u0304nse\u0304re, \"to assess\") and made it fundamental to their social order. The censors, the officeholders who conducted the census, determined each Roman citizen's position in an elaborate class hierarchy. This, in turn, dictated how that citizen and his family lived, how he could dress, how the law treated him, and how he could exercise political power. In principle, this stratification of Roman society was performed every five years. Each head of household would be called upon, in turn, to make his declaration. He would give his full name, that of his father\u2014or patron, in the case of a freed slave\u2014and his age. He would report his marital status and, if applicable, the name of his wife and the number, names, and ages of his children. He would then move on to an account of his property. This would proceed by tribe until it was complete. The censors were appointed for an 18-month term, and sheer logistics suggest the count must have taken most of this time.",
    " Title: Secret Service Lapses in White House Security: A Look at Recent Incidents and Their Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo incidents of security lapses at the White House have come to light, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the Secret Service in protecting the President and his family.\n\nIn a recent incident, an intruder, Omar J. Gonzalez, managed to breach the White House security on September 19, 2014. According to a report by The Washington Post, a plainclothes surveillance team tasked with preventing such incidents failed to notice Gonzalez. The attack dog that was supposed to be released did not respond, and the front door of the White House was left unlocked. An alarm box at the entrance was muted due to its annoyance to the usher's staff who work nearby. The agent who eventually tackled Gonzalez was off-duty and happened to be in the vicinity at the time. The first family was not in the building at the time of the incident.\n\nIn a 2011 incident, a man named Oscar Ortega-Hernandez parked his car about 700 yards from the White House and fired a semiautomatic weapon into the upstairs residence area. One of the Obama's daughters was home at the time. Some Secret Service officers thought there might have been an attack, but their supervisor decided it was just backfire from a vehicle and ordered them to stand down. It took four days for the Secret Service to understand that there was an armed attack, and only after a housekeeper discovered broken glass and chipped cement. The public and Congress were never properly informed.\n\nThe President and First Lady, Michelle Obama, were reportedly furious when they were told of the incident several days later. Several lawmakers noted at the hearing that the damage could have been unimaginably bad if the attackers had been organized terrorists rather than deranged individuals. Considering that President Obama has received three times the number of threats as his predecessors, there should be greater security for this White House.\n\nThe budget and size of the Secret Service have fallen in the last few years. In 2011, the agency had about 6,900 staff positions; it now has about 6,600. Its budget fell from $1.9 billion in 2012 to $1.8 billion in 2013, in part because of automatic cuts demanded by Congress, and it has gone up only slightly since then. Though money cannot be the only reason for these errors, people inside the agency say the cuts have led to staff burnout, low morale, and unmonitored posts.\n\nPresident Obama now has to decide whether Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is capable of protecting him and his family, as well as the nation's reputation. However, at a minimum, he has to insist on an independent, top-to-bottom review of the Secret Service, not one conducted by officials trying to protect themselves or their agency.",
    " Title: California Bill to Limit Vaccine Exemptions Advances, Sparks Debate on Individual Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nA bill in California that would restrict vaccine exemptions for students to only those with a valid medical reason has moved a step closer to becoming law, though it still faces several hurdles. The bill was introduced in response to a measles outbreak linked to nearly 150 infections traced back to Disneyland in late December.\n\nOutside the Capitol building in Sacramento on Wednesday, the bill sparked a debate between supporters and opponents, with both sides expressing concerns about individual rights and responsibilities. Opponents, some wearing American flags, argued that eliminating the personal belief exemption infringes on their ability to make decisions that are best for their children.\n\nLisa Cadrein of Los Angeles, an opponent of the bill, expressed fears that vaccines could harm her daughter. \"I am afraid that her big beautiful blue eyes will not focus on me anymore, and she won't be the kid that she is,\" Cadrein said.\n\nHowever, scientific studies show no link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder. Inside the hearing, parents also discussed the importance of protecting their children from those who are not vaccinated.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Lois Wolk, a member of the Senate Health Committee, spoke in favor of the pro-vaccine parents. \"Our individual rights are not without limits, and in this particular case, your insistence on your right really could harm my children or my grandchildren,\" Wolk said.\n\nThe health committee in California's Senate passed the bill 6-2 on Wednesday. The proposed legislation still has many more hearings before it could become law. Similar legislation to limit families' rights to opt out of mandatory vaccinations has been considered in Washington, Oregon, and North Carolina, but all efforts have stalled so far.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with Capital Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Advocates for School Reopening, Cites Study on COVID-19 Risk in Children\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has asserted that \"the science is on our side\" in support of President Donald Trump's push for the physical reopening of schools amid coronavirus concerns. During a press briefing on Thursday, McEnany argued that the risk of critical illness due to the novel coronavirus for children is \"far less\" than the seasonal flu, citing a study published by JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nMcEnany stated that the \"science should not stand in the way\" of schools reopening, a remark she later claimed had been taken out of context by the media. Trump has been vocal about advocating for schools to physically reopen over the past week, threatening funding to schools and stating he would put pressure on governors to reopen schools in their states.\n\nHealth experts have pointed to the risk of children contributing to the spread of the coronavirus. A number of school districts have moved forward with plans that incorporate virtual learning in the fall to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19, including public schools in Richmond, Va., which announced Wednesday they would have full virtual learning in the fall.\n\nMcEnany argued that the physical reopening of schools is essential for the wellbeing of students and their parents, citing potential issues such as a lack of reporting of abuse, mental depression, and suicidal ideations when students are not in school.\n\nTrump has forcefully advocated for schools to reopen, arguing that the risk to children remains low. Last week, he stated, \"We\u2019re going to be putting a lot of pressure on: Open your schools in the fall.\" Trump has praised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for directing schools to reopen in the fall, despite a large surge in coronavirus cases in the state.\n\nThe study cited by McEnany on Thursday found that \"severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults\" and that preexisting medical conditions seem to be an \"important factor\" with respect to children who contract the disease.\n\nTrump has been accused of eschewing the advice of public health experts, including by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who penned a scathing op-ed criticizing the president's response to the coronavirus on Thursday. Trump last week criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for reopening schools as \"very tough\" and \"expensive.\"",
    " Title: The New York Times Acknowledges Cautious Approach in 2016 Report on FBI's Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Times has issued a correction to a 2016 article regarding the origins of the FBI's investigation into potential links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The original article, published on October 31, 2016, was cautious in its language and downplayed the case due to law enforcement officials' advice.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, The New York Times reporters were informed by law enforcement officials that the FBI had scrutinized some of Donald Trump's advisers but found no proof of any involvement with Russian hacking. The resulting article reflected this caution and stated that agents had uncovered no \"conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government.\"\n\nThe key fact of the article\u2014that the FBI had opened a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\u2014was published in the 10th paragraph. The article's tone and headline, \"Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia,\" gave an air of finality to an investigation that was just beginning.\n\nThe Times disclosed in the middle of the updated article that during the 2016 probe, dubbed \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" at least one government informant met several times with two Trump campaign aides, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. This has become a contentious point, with Mr. Trump's allies questioning whether the FBI was spying on the Trump campaign or trying to entrap campaign officials.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted yesterday that if it's true, \"this is bigger than Watergate!\"\n\nThe paper's portrayal of the FBI's judgments\u2014and even misjudgments\u2014is sympathetic. The FBI was aggressive in the Hillary Clinton investigation, with James Comey discussing the probe and later its reopening, because everyone there thought she would win and they might be criticized for going soft on her. The FBI was cautious on Trump because everyone thought he would lose.\n\nIn the Times narrative, the FBI was just starting to scrutinize possible links between Trump associates and Russia and did not have enough evidence to go public. Beyond that, \"anything the FBI did publicly would only give fodder to Mr. Trump's claims on the campaign trail that the election was rigged.\"\n\nTrump yesterday linked to a National Review piece by Andrew McCarthy, who argued that the paper's analysis was \"bunk.\" He said the Hillary probe was a criminal investigation involving her email server, while Trump was subjected to a counterintelligence probe in the hope of turning up evidence to use against him.\n\nThe extent of the FBI's knowledge and actions during the Trump investigation is still a matter of debate, with some viewing it as a quiet, diligent investigation, while others see a bogus investigation that unfairly put Robert Mueller on Trump's trail.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Makes History as First Female Presidential Nominee of a Major U.S. Party\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the wife of former President Bill Clinton, made history on Thursday as the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The theme of the evening was \"Stronger Together,\" and Clinton's speech focused on differentiating herself from her rival, Donald Trump, in terms of foreign policy and economic leadership.\n\nClinton's speech largely avoided topics such as faith, religious liberty, and abortion, but she did mention her Methodist faith and referenced her mother's admonition to \"do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton, Hillary's daughter, also made history as the child of two presidential candidates from the same party. In her speech, Chelsea expressed her pride in her mother and gratitude for being her daughter.\n\nHillary Clinton's focus during her speech was to unite the party and appease supporters of her former opponent, Bernie Sanders. She praised President Barack Obama and affirmed her support for his legacy. Clinton also took aim at Donald Trump, criticizing his campaign and presenting her own vision for the country.\n\nTrump, in turn, took to Twitter to criticize Clinton, stating that \"no one has worse judgment than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.\"\n\nClinton made multiple promises throughout her nearly one-hour speech, including her plan to support local forces in taking out ISIS, creating more good jobs with rising wages in the United States, and working with Sen. Bernie Sanders on education. She also promised to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt-free for all, and to liberate millions of people who already have student debt.\n\nClinton also addressed foreign policy, attacking Trump's ability to handle complicated foreign affairs and promising to provide the necessary leadership. She ended the night on a note of promise for the future, telling Americans, \"We are stronger together.\"",
    " Title: Theresa May's Third Brexit Defeat Marks a Shift in Strategy Amidst Looming Deadline\n\nArticle:\n\nBritain finds itself in a precarious yet opportunity-filled situation following Theresa May's third consecutive Brexit defeat in the House of Commons on Friday. The margin of defeat was significantly smaller than the previous two on January 15 and March 12, with a majority of 58 votes rather than the previous 230 and 149. This latest defeat primarily concerned the withdrawal agreement portion of the EU-UK deal, rather than the deal in its entirety.\n\nIn essence, this was, in all but name, the third \"meaningful vote\" on the Brexit deal this year, with all three resulting in the same outcome. In her comments following the latest defeat, Prime Minister May seemed to leave open the possibility of a fourth attempt. However, this would be unprecedented, as the limit for such attempts has arguably been reached.\n\nOne reason for May's persistence in putting the deal before parliament multiple times was to maintain some semblance of the Brexit process. The date set by May two years ago for Britain's departure from the EU was March 29. Her repeated misjudgments, including her refusal to engage with remain supporters and the loss of her majority in 2017, meant that the deadline was not met. However, May was attempting to demonstrate to leave voters that, despite obstacles, it was not her who was obstructing Brexit. With a pro-leave crowd outside parliament, May was trying to shift the blame onto Labour and her own hardliners.\n\nThe attorney general, in the beginning of the debate, stated that the primary reason for trying again was procedural. May needed to get her deal through in order to move back the latest Brexit deadline from April 12 to May 22. This might have allowed time for the final tranche of withdrawal legislation to pass without the UK becoming involved in the European parliament elections. However, with the current state of affairs, this is unlikely to occur. Britain now faces a choice between a no-deal exit in two weeks or a much longer delay to Brexit, during which the UK will probably participate in the EU elections.\n\nMay also had more partisan reasons. The revolt by MPs last Monday, in which they took control of parliament from the government, opened up the possibility that opposition MPs and pro-European Tories might soften the deal, revoke article 50, or insist on a second referendum. Many Conservative MPs were alarmed by this prospect. With May also promising to step down if her deal was adopted, more than 40 of her MPs switched to support a deal they had previously rejected. This was to no avail, but Downing Street seems to have calculated that it should bank these switchers in order to make things easier for the deal if they try a fourth time.\n\nHowever, a fourth attempt now seems unlikely. May's defeat has cleared the way for a different approach. This week's indicative votes are unfinished business, with new versions to be presented to MPs on Monday. The movers have learned from their defeats, something May seems incapable of doing. Two propositions \u2013 in favor of a customs union and for a second referendum on the final deal \u2013 are very much in play. If the Commons can rally behind these, the EU summit on April 10 should be asked to grant the UK a longer extension of article 50 to cement a different form of deal, with a public vote on it at the end.\n\nIt is ironic that May's third defeat may have finally created space for a very different approach from the one she has followed for three years.",
    " Title: Report Alleges Labor Secretary Nominee Thomas Perez Made \"Quid Pro Quo\" Deal with St. Paul Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nA congressional Republican report has alleged that Labor Secretary nominee Thomas Perez, in his previous role as Assistant Attorney General, made a \"quid pro quo\" deal with leaders of the Minnesota city of St. Paul in 2012. The deal, according to the report, involved dropping a contentious lawsuit in exchange for the Justice Department staying out of whistleblower cases brought against the city.\n\nThe report, obtained in advance by Fox News, claims Perez \"manipulated\" federal law and \"pushed the limits of justice to make this deal happen.\" The allegations could impact Perez's pending confirmation hearing, scheduled for this Thursday.\n\nThe report, titled \"How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez Manipulated Justice and Ignored Rule of Law,\" is a joint effort by minority leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Republican-led House's Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees.\n\nThe report states that the Justice Department's decision to opt out of the whistleblower cases potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million\u2014the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case. The other end of the alleged deal was for the Justice Department not to get involved in cases against the city of St. Paul that alleged the city received millions in Department of Housing and Urban Development funds but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low-income workers.\n\nThe report also alleges that Perez's actions were motivated by a concern that the Supreme Court would strike down a major element of civil rights enforcement if it reviewed a case involving St. Paul's appeal to the Supreme Court, on a case in which property owners said the city made extraordinary efforts, through strict code enforcement, to condemn their properties. The owners said reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal Fair Housing Act\u2014by what is known as \"disparate impact.\"\n\nThe \"disparate impact\" provision, which the report described as legally questionable, prohibits housing policies that end up discriminating against certain groups even if those policies are not blatantly discriminatory.\n\nCongressional Democrats have disputed the allegations, putting out a statement and memo of their own late Sunday refuting the details. The statement said the \"overwhelming evidence\" indicates Perez and others \"acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing.\" They said the decision not to intervene in the suit against St. Paul was based on expert recommendations.\n\nThe Justice Department has also disputed the allegations, claiming that the department held three staff briefings, heard 24 hours of additional testimony, and reviewed 1,400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene. The department maintains that the litigation decisions made by the department were in the best interests of the United States and were consistent with the department's legal, ethical, and professional responsibility obligations.",
    " Title: Partisanship and Intelligence Agencies: A Historical Perspective on the Debate over FBI and CIA's Role in the Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent debate over the appropriateness of scrutinizing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the origins of the Russia probe has been met with polarized opinions, reflecting a long-standing partisan divide in the United States. This article provides a historical perspective on the evolving relationship between politics and intelligence agencies in the U.S.\n\nBefore the upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a time when many Americans held unquestioning faith in federal law-enforcement agencies. However, this faith has since been eroded, and the notion that the intelligence community is above politics has become outdated. The intelligence community's role has always been a matter of politics by other means, as demonstrated by the events of the past few decades.\n\nAttorney General William Barr's decision to launch an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation has sparked controversy, with Democrats expressing concern about what they perceive as an attempt to shift the narrative from Trump's alleged collusion with Russia to an unprecedented probe of a presidential campaign. The investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed to prove the collusion allegations, and Barr's attempt to determine whether the probe was an abuse of power is seen as a reasonable course of action by some, but a significant problem for Democrats who are pursuing the impeachment of President Trump.\n\nThe debate has led to criticism from Democrats and Trump administration critics, with CNN crime-and-justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz stating that it is \"troubling\" that the Department of Justice is questioning the work of CIA agents. However, this criticism ignores the historical precedent of investigations into the activities of the intelligence community, particularly during the political ferment of the 1970s and '80s, when congressional committees led by Democrats such as Frank Church and Otis Pike conducted far-reaching investigations that embarrassed the intelligence establishment.\n\nIn the past, it was Republicans defending the FBI and CIA against Democrats' charges that these agencies were out of control. However, since the summer of 2016, when the intelligence establishment seemed to join forces to raise alarms about Russian meddling in the presidential election and allegations of Trump-campaign collusion, Democrats have acted as if Langley and Quantico are beyond reproach. By contrast, Republicans who had been stalwart CIA and FBI defenders suddenly became bitter critics, demanding transparency and sometimes floating conspiracy theories about the intelligence community's activities.\n\nSensible people of either party will always seek to balance deference to the intelligence community's mission, which often requires a fair degree of secrecy, with an understanding that all government officials and agencies must be kept on a tight leash lest they abuse the power vested in them. The ongoing debate over the Russia probe serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and accountability in the intelligence community, and the importance of maintaining a healthy skepticism towards government agencies, regardless of political affiliation.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Pushes for Immigration Legislation, Despite Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is persisting in his efforts to pass immigration legislation, despite opposition from some members of his own party and skepticism from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Last week, rank-and-file House members sent a message that President Obama is not a reliable partner for legislation, causing concern among top proponents, including Paul Ryan.\n\nRep. Jeff Denham of California, who has met with Boehner on the issue, stated that immigration is part of the House Republican agenda and that no decisions have been made on whether to move forward. Boehner's office has released several documents outlining the GOP's principles on immigration, which include eliminating the ability for the administration to arbitrarily decide which laws to enforce.\n\nImmigration advocates outside Congress have been relatively pleased with the principles and their reception by the GOP. Frank Sharry, founder and executive director of America's Voice and one of the nation's leading proponents for immigration reform, noted that few House Republican caucus members have publicly opposed the policy.\n\nHowever, the push for immigration legislation is facing resistance from conservatives, causing significant doubt within Boehner's leadership team. GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy, who supports moving forward on the issue, is feeling the heat from his conservative district, which has a significant anti-amnesty sentiment. Meanwhile, Majority Leader Eric Cantor has put effort into a GOP version of the DREAM Act, but is keeping an eye on his right flank in case Boehner retires at the end of this Congress.\n\nIn response to Denham's claim that floor time has been scheduled for immigration bills, Cantor spokesman Rory Cooper stated, \"There has been nothing scheduled as of now.\" Ryan, meanwhile, confirmed that he had met secretly with top Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer on immigration but dismissed the importance of the session.\n\nThe issue is complicated, as some lawmakers who support the principles are not in favor of moving forward on legislation. In many cases, members only implied their stance on the underlying question rather than explicitly stating it. The result of a meeting among lawmakers on the issue seems to have changed Ryan's tone in the days afterward.\n\nConservative heavyweights like Reps. Tom Price and Jeb Hensarling have come out strongly against moving forward, and the result of the meeting seemed to change Ryan's tone in the days afterward. One conservative lawmaker warned Boehner that he is \"out for a walk with nobody tagging along.\"\n\nRep. Tom Cotton, a freshman member running for Senate in Arkansas, stated that he does not anticipate legislation will come to the floor. Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio, another Gang of Eight member, was more pessimistic, stating that the House should not move forward in 2014. Sen. Lindsey Graham, another Gang of Eight member, argued that Republicans can trust Obama to enforce any immigration bills they send him, as 80% of Americans want to secure the border, and the Democratic party would be politically damaged if they did not.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Raises Political Profile Amidst 2016 Presidential Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush has been the center of political speculation as he voices his opinions on current issues, fueling rumors of a potential 2016 presidential run. On Monday, Bush appeared on NBC's \"Today\" show, discussing topics such as immigration reform, the 2013 sequester, and budget crises.\n\nBush, who has remained relatively quiet since his brother, former President George W. Bush, left the White House, has recently released a new book titled \"Immigration Wars,\" outlining his stance on granting illegal immigrants legal status but not a pathway to citizenship. He is also a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 2013, taking place in Washington from March 14 to 16.\n\nDuring the interview with Matt Lauer, Bush expressed optimism about finding a consensus on immigration but emphasized the need to resolve budget matters to focus on immigration reform and energy policy. When asked about a potential 2016 run, Bush neither confirmed nor denied the speculation, stating, \"That's way off into the future... I'm not going to declare it today either.\"\n\nAnother potential 2016 contender is Chris Christie, but CPAC organizers have reportedly snubbed the popular New Jersey governor, who gave the keynote address at the 2012 Republican National Convention. Bush expressed surprise at Christie's exclusion, attributing it to his handling of budget issues related to Hurricane Sandy and his criticism of House Republicans.\n\nBush clarified that CPAC's snub of Christie was not due to his public appearances with President Barack Obama after Hurricane Sandy or his criticism of House Republicans. Instead, Bush suggested the issue was the governor's advocacy for a $60 billion spending deal that was not directly related to Sandy recovery, with House Republicans eventually agreeing to funding for Sandy recovery.\n\nBush expressed his admiration for Christie, stating, \"I think Gov. Christie is a part of the future of the Republican Party for sure, and whether he's going to CPAC or not is not really changing that.\"",
    " Title: Mitt Romney and Donald Trump Engage in a Public Spat over Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney responded to a barrage of insults from Donald Trump, the current GOP frontrunner, regarding the latter's tax returns. The war of words between the two began on Wednesday during a Fox News interview, where Romney suggested that there might be something amiss in Trump's tax returns.\n\n\"We're now, you know, in late February and we still have not seen either Donald Trump's or Marco Rubio's or Ted Cruz's taxes,\" Romney told Fox's Neil Cavuto. \"Frankly, the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be.\"\n\nRegarding Trump's tax returns specifically, Romney stated they \"are likely to be a bombshell.\" Trump, however, has only said that his campaign will \"make that determination over the next couple of months.\"\n\nTrump's response to Romney's comments was swift and acerbic. In a series of tweets, he referred to Romney as \"a losing candidate\" and \"one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.\" He also implied that Romney was jealous of him and questioned his loyalty.\n\nTrump's tweets included:\n\n* \"Mitt Romney, who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy.\"\n* \"Another tweet explained that the photo, of Trump glaring as he looks up from signing a stack of papers, depicted him'signing a recent tax return.'\"\n* \"He labeled Romney 'one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics' in a tweet. He punctuated that message with another insult: 'Dope!'\"\n* \"Later, in another post on the social media platform, Trump promised that he was 'going to do what @ MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN!'\"\n\nTrump's anti-Romney tirade also grew to encompass another figure in the Republican establishment, opponent Marco Rubio. The attacks will likely continue on the Republican debate stage Thursday night, where the remaining five GOP candidates will gather for their last bout before the Super Tuesday nominating contests.\n\nTrump has also effectively crowd-sourced the art of the insult to his considerable Twitter following, and he has made it a point to repost his followers' attacks. Some of these tweets include:\n\n* \"@ahernandez85a: @realDonaldTrump Mr Tough Guy Romney should be backing Trump like Trump backed him last time # NoLoyalty\" - Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) February 25, 2016\n* \"@conservativevin: @ahernandez85a Romney should have been a tough guy with Obama. He cowered and lost. BADLY! He's not relevant!\" - Donald J.

    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder Faces Congressional Scrutiny Over AP Phone Records, Alleges Republican Conduct as \"Shameful\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder accused Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of withholding information from Congress and called his conduct \"shameful.\" The hearing, which focused on a new set of scandals, included allegations against the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the handling of a government leak to The Associated Press (AP).\n\nThe AP, along with several lawmakers, claim that the DOJ infringed on the constitutional rights of the press by secretly obtaining two months' worth of phone records. During the hearing, lawmakers attempted to get answers from Holder, but he repeatedly rebuffed questions by claiming he was not involved in the decision-making process.\n\nRep. James Sensenbrenner, among a group of bipartisan lawmakers, pressed Holder on the secret collection of telephone records. Holder stated that he had recused himself from the case because \"I am a possessor of information eventually leaked.\" He also noted that he was unable to answer questions about why the DOJ failed to negotiate with the AP prior to obtaining subpoenas, a standard practice in these cases.\n\nHolder testified that all the decisions made in the case fell on Deputy Attorney General James Cole's shoulders. Sensenbrenner suggested having Cole testify before the House Judiciary Committee, but Cole's testimony would likely yield few answers due to his inability to discuss ongoing cases.\n\nRep. John Conyers, D-Mich., expressed concern about the government's actions, stating, \"I am troubled by the notion that our government would pursue a broad array of phone records over a period of time.\" However, like Sensenbrenner, he was unable to pull any new information about the AP case from Holder.\n\nOn Monday, AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt disclosed the government's action in a letter to Holder, which was made public. In the letter, Pruitt called the collection of phone records at four AP bureaus a \"massive and unprecedented intrusion\" of the news agency's freedom of press rights granted under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe AP case has sparked bipartisan outrage, with members of both parties publicly questioning the government's actions. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for Holder's resignation, stating, \"Freedom of the press is an essential right in a free society.\" Holder acknowledged Priebus' calls for his resignation during his opening remarks, but again noted that he was not behind the subpoena.\n\nNew York Sen. Charles Schumer plans to reintroduce legislation that would protect journalists from revealing their sources. The bill, which was brought up in 2009, has since stalled in Congress.\n\nUnder Holder's command, the DOJ has prosecuted more government officials for alleged leaks under the World War I-era Espionage Act than all of the AGs who came before him \u2013 combined. The Obama administration has been aggressive in going after government workers leaking classified information, with the White House bringing indictments against five workers and the Defense Department pursuing a sixth case against the U.S. Army soldier accused of sending classified documents to the anti-secrecy online group WikiLeaks.",
    " Title: Texas Senator Ted Cruz Announces 2016 Presidential Bid: A Look at His Strengths as a GOP Candidate\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz has officially declared his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, making him the first major contender to enter the race. Here are several compelling reasons why Cruz is considered a strong GOP presidential candidate for 2016:\n\n1. Early Start: Cruz is expected to begin his campaign immediately, rather than launching an exploratory committee, a strategy often employed by potential candidates.\n\n2. Tea Party Support: Amy Kremer, former head of the Tea Party Express, told The Associated Press that Cruz's announcement will \"excite the base in a way we haven't seen in years.\"\n\n3. Opposition to Obamacare: Cruz is one of the party's most vocal opponents of the Affordable Care Act, having spoken for over 21 hours on the Senate floor in an attempt to defund the act in September 2013.\n\n4. Strong Stand on Immigration: In December, Cruz defied GOP leaders to force a vote on opposing President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration, although the strategy ultimately failed.\n\n5. Perceived Independence: Cruz is seen as more independent than other potential GOP candidates, as demonstrated by his defiance of party leaders on immigration.\n\n6. Mainstream Republican Stance: Unlike some fellow candidates, Cruz is firmly in the mainstream of Republican voters on nearly every issue, unlike some fellow candidates such as Jeb Bush, who supports legalization for undocumented immigrants, and Rand Paul, who supported normalizing relations with Cuba.\n\n7. Campaigning Ability: Cruz scored one of the biggest upsets in the 2012 election when he defeated David Dewhurst in the Texas GOP primary. Dewhurst, who was Governor Rick Perry's lieutenant governor, spent over $20 million of his own money but could not overcome the Cruz campaign.\n\n8. Potential Appeal to Hispanic Voters: Cruz's father was born in Cuba, and Cruz is the first Hispanic U.S. Senator from Texas.\n\n9. Past Election Success: Cruz contends that the GOP needs a strong conservative to win the general election, citing past elections as evidence.\n\n10. Bipartisan Appeal: Cruz could potentially appeal to disillusioned voters from both parties.\n\n11. Legal Background: Cruz has a strong legal background, having earned his law degree at Harvard University and clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n\n12. Campaign Asset: Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, is expected to be a significant asset in the campaign. She worked on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, served at the National Security Council under Condoleezza Rice and at the Treasury Department, and most recently was a managing director for Goldman Sachs in Houston. She has taken an unpaid leave to help her husband's campaign.",
    " Title: Major Companies Explain Payments to Michael Cohen's Essential Consultants LLC\n\nArticle:\n\nMultiple media outlets have confirmed reports that Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' attorney, claimed that the Michael Cohen-affiliated shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, received large sums from companies potentially affected by Trump administration decisions. Essential Consultants LLC, a single-member LLC solely owned by Cohen, was created and registered in Delaware less than a month before the 2016 election.\n\nHere are the explanations provided by the companies for their payments to Michael Cohen's Essential Consultants LLC:\n\n1. Korean Aerospace Industries, a defense contractor, paid $150,000 for \"legal consulting concerning accounting standards on production costs.\" The company stated it was unaware of Cohen's connection to Donald Trump.\n\n2. AT&T paid Cohen $600,000 for \"understanding how the President and his administration might approach a wide range of policy issues, including regulatory reform at the FCC, corporate tax reform, and antitrust enforcement.\"\n\n3. Novartis, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, hired Cohen to \"advise the company as to how the Trump administration might approach certain U.S. healthcare policy matters, including the Affordable Care Act.\" However, Novartis did not meet with Cohen until a month after the contract was signed, and they decided not to engage further with him.\n\n4. Columbus Nova, a New York investment firm, paid Cohen $500,000 to work as a business consultant for potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures. Columbus Nova's CEO is the cousin of a Russian billionaire named Viktor Vekselberg, who controls the Renova Group. The Renova Group's website previously listed Columbus Nova as a subsidiary, but the pages containing this information have since been taken offline. Columbus Nova's attorney stated that any insinuation that the payment to Cohen was related to Vekselberg is \"patently untrue.\"\n\nThese four entities paid a company with no known employees millions of dollars for advice about accounting standards, telecom reform, tax policy, antitrust law, the Affordable Care Act, and high-end investment opportunities during the same period that the company was also involved in nondisclosure payments to a pornographic actress and a Playboy playmate. One of the companies that paid Cohen is now downplaying a previously disclosed connection to a Russian billionaire affected by economic sanctions.",

Avenatti publicized Swetnick's claim that Kavanaugh routinely organized drug-and-alcohol-fueled gang rapes at high-school parties.\n\nSwetnick presented those allegations to the Committee on September 26 in a sworn statement, but later backed off her claims during an October 1 interview with NBC News, conceding that she never witnessed Kavanaugh spike anyone's drink or participate in gang rape.\n\nIn a lengthy letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Grassley outlined his rationale for the investigation, stating, \"When a well-meaning citizen comes forward with information relevant to the committee's work, I take it seriously. It takes courage to come forward, especially with allegations of sexual misconduct or personal trauma.\" He added, \"But in the heat of partisan moments, some do try to knowingly mislead the committee. That's unfair to my colleagues, the nominees, and others providing information who are seeking the truth.\"\n\nGrassley continued, \"Ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future.\" He emphasized that the law prohibits such false statements to Congress and obstruction of congressional committee investigations.\n\nIn response to the referral, Avenatti expressed enthusiasm on Twitter, stating, \"Maybe if Grassley was actually a lawyer that knew something about the law, he would realize what he has done. He just opened up Pandora's box as it relates to Justice Kavanaugh's conduct. It is Christmas in October!\" and \"Ironically, Senator Grassley now is interested in investigations. He didn't care when it came to putting a man on the SCOTUS for life.\" Avenatti has yet to issue a formal statement regarding the referral.",

One particularly tense exchange ended with Trump telling Stahl, \"In the meantime, I\u2019m the president \u2013 and you\u2019re not.\"\n\nRegarding climate change, the conversation revolved around the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, one of the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history. Trump stated, \"I think something\u2019s happening. Something\u2019s changing and it\u2019ll change back again. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hoax, I think there\u2019s probably a difference. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s manmade.\"\n\nWhen Stahl pressed Trump on the issue, he responded, \"I\u2019m not denying climate change. But it could very well go back. You know, we\u2019re talking about over millions of years.\"\n\nTrump also expressed trust in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stating, \"I do trust him, yeah, I trust him.\" However, he qualified this by saying, \"That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be proven wrong about (denuclearization).\"\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump's comments about not trusting everyone in the White House were also brought up, with Trump agreeing, \"I feel the same way.\"\n\nTrump maintained that there was interference in the 2016 election, but he emphasized that Russia was not the only country involved. \"They meddled. But I think China meddled, too,\" Trump said when asked if Russia had run interference in the last presidential election.\n\nWhen discussing the contentious Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination process, Trump lamented the Democrats' treatment of Kavanaugh and expressed a desire for national unity, but felt that Democrats were not ready to heal.\n\nTo close the interview, Trump was asked about finding his \"sea legs\" as president. He stated that he found it \"a little surreal to say I\u2019m President of the United States\" in the beginning, but quickly added, \"Now, I very much feel like POTUS. I do. I feel like the president.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Struggle to Pass AHCA: Lack of Understanding of GOP Concerns and Focus on Winning\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump faced challenges in securing the support of GOP congressmen for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) due to a perceived lack of understanding of their concerns. Despite numerous attempts to persuade lawmakers, including meetings at the White House, phone calls, and threats, the bill was ultimately not passed.\n\nThe AHCA was withdrawn by President Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday afternoon. Earlier in the week, Trump had emphasized that failure to pass the bill could cost the GOP their majority in the 2018 midterm elections. However, the bill's failure to pass could also potentially cost the GOP their majority if a replacement plan was perceived as inadequate by voters.\n\nThe House Republicans who refused to vote for the bill were not motivated by a lack of desire to replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Instead, they were primarily concerned about the content of the bill and its potential impact on consumers. Some felt that the AHCA would not lower premiums enough, while others objected to the bill's similarities to Obamacare.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the bill would reduce insurance costs in the long term but increase them in the first three years. This raises questions about whether voters would support the GOP in the 2018 midterm elections if a replacement plan passed but premiums remained high.\n\nSome House Republicans also objected to the AHCA's requirement for comprehensive coverage, arguing that it adds to the costs of insurers and raises premiums. On the other hand, consumers value comprehensive coverage.\n\nIt appears that President Trump was more focused on securing a win than on understanding the specific details of the legislation that made GOP lawmakers reluctant to vote for it. An unnamed House GOP aide told CNN that Trump \"either doesn't know, doesn't care, or both\" about the details of the legislation.\n\nIn the Los Angeles Times, Michael Steel, a former GOP leadership aide, offered a portrait of a president who is both eager and clueless. Steel stated that Ryan has learned that his wonky style of communication is wasted on Trump due to the president's lack of interest in policy details. However, Trump has come to value the president's eagerness to exert pressure on wavering Republicans.\n\nIn conclusion, President Trump's focus on winning rather than understanding the details of the AHCA may have contributed to the bill's failure to pass. This lack of focus on the details may have denied Trump the victory he sought so desperately.",
    " Title: Obama Chooses Least Bad Option in Syria: Limited Strike Over No Action or Regime Change\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama appears to have chosen the least bad option in Syria, opting for a limited military strike against the Assad regime rather than doing nothing or pursuing regime change. This decision comes after a large chemical weapons attack in the country, which has been met with international condemnation.\n\nThe choice of a limited strike is seen as a risky move, but it is considered less risky than doing nothing or attempting regime change. If Obama does not act, he risks being perceived as ineffective, according to Aaron Miller, a former U.S. State Department official.\n\nThe option of doing nothing is not a viable one, as Obama had previously drawn a red line against the use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The recent chemical attack is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988, and over 100,000 Syrians have died in the ongoing civil conflict.\n\nThe administration's actions and statements in the past few days have been described as the most well-advertised and telegraphed military action in modern warfare. Secretary of State John Kerry's powerful statement of moral outrage and the president's PBS interview have created a strong commitment to strike.\n\nHowever, the president has avoided the option of a more robust policy, such as the use of no-fly zones, extensive use of U.S. air and missile power to degrade the regime, and military support for the opposition. This approach has been advocated by some U.S. senators and interventionists, who argue that Syria poses a major threat to U.S. interests and that only a takedown of the Assad regime will address the problem.\n\nThe president's decision to avoid this option is due to the general problem of an open-ended military commitment and the lack of correlation between the use of U.S. military power and its relation to the end state. Syria is in the throes of a brutal civil war, with more than 1,000 disparate rebel groups, many of which are allied with extremist groups. A victory of the latter would be a blow to U.S. interests. Ousting Assad would not be cheap or easy, and the post-Assad environment could be unstable and lack a credible central authority.\n\nThe limited strike option is far from ideal, as it is unlikely to change the arc of the battlefield balance. There are also other downsides, such as the potential for escalation and the danger of a response by Hezbollah or Syria against Israel. The use of force without a real strategy can also undermine American credibility.\n\nDespite the risks, the president's actions leave him no other choice, given the apparent use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime and the international outcry that followed. The president's decision to act is a departure from his previous reluctance to use military force, and he may face opposition from some members of Congress and international allies.",
    " Title: Analysis: Sanders' Electability in the 2020 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent polling data suggests that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders may be more electable than some Democrats fear. National and swing state polls indicate that Sanders is tied with or beating President Donald Trump, contradicting doomsday warnings about his potential nomination and subsequent general election performance.\n\nA Quinnipiac Poll from last week shows Sanders leading Trump in Michigan and Pennsylvania. A CBS News/YouGov poll shows Sanders beating Trump nationally, while a Texas Lyceum poll indicates that Sanders performs better against Trump in Texas than any other Democratic candidate, losing by just three points.\n\nSanders' strong online presence is another factor that sets him apart. He has larger followings on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other platforms than his rivals, and has demonstrated new media sophistication that others lack.\n\nSanders' loyal base is another significant advantage. His supporters consistently donate to his campaign and attend rallies, and their dedication is evident in elections. Sanders is the best-funded non-billionaire in the Democratic field, and his supporters' loyalty could be a deciding factor in the election.\n\nSanders' self-proclaimed big government socialism has not deterred voters, as 45% of the electorate does not seem to be concerned with Trump's outlandishness.\n\nPeter Hamby, who works for Snapchat and writes for Vanity Fair, argues that Democrats may be underestimating Sanders' electability. Hamby suggests that instead of questioning Sanders' electability, one should ask if Sanders is the most electable Democrat in the 2020 election. He posits that Sanders' celebrity status, both old-school and new-age, makes him well-suited to compete with Trump in the current political climate.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is impossible to predict the outcome of the 2020 presidential election with certainty, the evidence suggests that Sanders may be more electable than some Democrats fear. His strong polling numbers, loyal base, and media savvy position him as a formidable opponent to President Trump. However, it is essential to remember that voter preferences can be unpredictable, and the final outcome will depend on various factors, including the candidates' performances in debates, campaign strategies, and unforeseen events.",
    " Title: Texas Legislature Passes Restrictive Abortion Bill, Prompting Promise of Legal Challenge and Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Texas Legislature has passed an omnibus abortion bill, one of the most restrictive in the nation. The bill, which is expected to be signed into law by Governor Rick Perry, will ban abortions after 20 weeks, require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and mandate that all abortions take place in surgical centers.\n\nThe Republican majority in the Texas Legislature passed the bill unchanged just before midnight, with all but one Democrat voting against it. The bill's passage followed more than 2,000 demonstrators filling the Capitol building in Austin to oppose the bill, with state troopers removing six protesters from the Senate chamber for attempting to disrupt the debate.\n\nGovernor Perry stated, \"Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life.\" He added, \"This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women's health.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Royce West, speaking on the Senate floor, vowed, \"There will be a lawsuit. I promise you.\"\n\nDemocrats offered 20 amendments to the bill, ranging from exceptions for rape and incest to allowing doctors more leeway in prescribing abortion-inducing drugs. However, Republicans rejected these amendments.\n\nThe bill is part of a series of measures across the nation championed by anti-abortion groups, aiming for a constitutional challenge to Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a woman's right to decide on an abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb.\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, to which Texas falls under, has shown a willingness to accept more stringent limits on abortions. Passing the law also appeases Christian conservatives, who make up the majority of Republican primary voters.\n\nHowever, the measure has sparked protests in Texas not seen in at least 20 years, with thousands of abortion rights supporters flooding the Capitol to draw out normally boring committee hearings and disrupting key votes. Protesters finished a filibuster started by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth by jeering for the last 15 minutes of the first special session, effectively killing the bill.",
    " Title: EPA Collusion with Environmental Groups Alleged in \"Sue and Settle\" Lawsuits\n\nArticle:\n\nA study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has found that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has given radical environmental groups a significant role in drafting environmental regulations, while excluding the people and industries most likely to be affected. The EPA has reportedly collaborated with groups such as the Sierra Club, WildEarth Guardians, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nThis collaboration is facilitated through a legal technique known as \"sue and settle,\" in which environmental groups file lawsuits against federal agencies, resulting in \"consent decrees\" that are settled in closed-door meetings. The settlements are then implemented without a public comment period, allowing the EPA to enact regulations favored by the environmental groups.\n\nThe result is a regulatory regime that imposes costs on industries and consumers while granting economically damaging policy prescriptions to radical environmental groups. For example, a settlement between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Center for Biological Diversity over endangered-species rules could lead to federal control over private lands in several oil- and natural gas-producing states, potentially threatening thousands of private landowners' leases.\n\nThe \"sue and settle\" litigation is reportedly taking a toll on industries, consumers, and state treasuries across the nation. A suit filed by WildEarth Guardians has led to eight states spending millions to comply with EPA regulations to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. A \"sue and settle\" case involving the Navajo Generating Station is expected to raise electricity costs for Arizonans by an estimated 20 percent a year.\n\nThe EPA's alleged collusion with environmental groups and its use of the \"sue and settle\" method of promulgating regulations has raised questions about the agency's accountability and direction. Critics argue that the EPA's focus on environmental regulations may be prioritizing a green ideology over its primary mission of protecting human health and the environment based on the best available scientific information.\n\nFormer Republican member of the House of Representatives Bob Beauprez has criticized the EPA's actions, stating that science has taken a back seat to a green ideology that puts politics before \"we the people.\" The American Traditions Institute has also sued the EPA for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request for details about these questionable alliances.",
    " Title: Senate Unveils Sweeping Budget Deal, Faces Uncertainty in House\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is on the verge of passing a two-year budget agreement that would increase defense and domestic spending by over $400 billion. However, the bill faces a potential roadblock due to Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) demand for a vote on restoring the 2011 budget caps. The Senate was unable to pass the bill before a midnight deadline, leading to a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe budget agreement, negotiated by congressional leaders, hit a snag when Sen. Paul demanded a vote on reinstating the 2011 budget caps, which limited congressional spending. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to allow the vote, and Paul refused to back down. Paul's right to object will elapse at 1 a.m., and the Senate will proceed to vote on the measure, which includes short-term federal funding through March 23. However, federal funding from the last short-term spending bill expires at midnight.\n\nThe 652-page budget bill, if approved, would then go to the House, where it faces stiff opposition from both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. The measure eliminates the budget caps, paving the way for Congress to increase defense spending by $165 billion and domestic spending by $131 billion over the next two years. The bill is also packed with other fiscal provisions, including a major disaster relief package for regions affected by last year's devastating storms and a one-year suspension of the debt limit.\n\nPresident Trump has endorsed the deal, stating, \"Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill.\" Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have both championed the agreement as a bipartisan breakthrough that would end the cycle of short-term spending bills.\n\nThe bill's fate in the House remains unclear, with both Democrats and Republicans facing internal party divisions over the deal. Defense hawks and moderate Republicans view it as a strong compromise that will provide a much-needed boost to the military, while conservatives criticize it as a budget-busting proposal that will further sink the country in a sea of red ink.\n\nDemocrats are also conflicted because while the deal would increase spending for their favored domestic programs, the agreement does nothing to protect the DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi delivered an 8-hour speech on the House floor, objecting to the budget plan's failure to protect DREAMers.\n\nIf conservative Republicans in the House oppose the agreement, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will need a significant number of Democratic votes to get it passed. However, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the Democratic whip, urged his members to line up in opposition to the deal.\n\nIf the bill passes both chambers, it would give Congress six weeks to craft a spending bill for the rest of 2018 that meets the new budget targets before the government runs out of money again.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation of Hillary Clinton's Email Server: A Turning Point in the Clinton's 35-Year Career\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State has been a recurring theme in her political career, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) playing a significant role in several of her scandals. This investigation, which has been a topic of intense scrutiny for months, is now being recognized as a potential turning point in the Clinton's 35-year career of navigating legal controversies.\n\nThe article discusses the author's perspective on Clinton's continued association with Huma Abedin, a long-time aide, despite her husband, Anthony Weiner, being embroiled in multiple scandals. The author questions Clinton's judgment in keeping Abedin on her staff, given Weiner's history of sexting and the subsequent revelation of classified documents on his laptop.\n\nThe article also recounts instances of Clinton's interactions with the FBI, dating back to the 1980s in Arkansas, when FBI Special Agent I.C. Smith questioned her role in fundraising for her husband, Governor Bill Clinton. The author also references the 1997 Congressional inquiry into the Clintons, during which then-FBI Director Louis Freeh compared his experiences with the Clintons to his work on organized crime cases in New York City.\n\nMore recently, the article mentions the investigation led by FBI Director James Comey, who, in July, did not recommend indictment but did state that Clinton had lied to the bureau in her testimony and that her handling of classified information was \"extremely careless.\" This statement, along with Comey's subsequent letter to Congress, has been a point of contention in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nThe article concludes with a reference to former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom's description of the Clintons as a \"crime family,\" a characterization that echoes Freeh's remarks from 1997. The author asserts that the FBI's investigation of Clinton's email server is a significant development in the Clintons' long history of legal controversies, with the investigation's impact becoming increasingly apparent even to Washington's political establishment.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Indiana Abortion Remains Law, Sparking National Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States upheld an Indiana law on Tuesday that requires the burial or cremation of fetal remains following an abortion. The decision has further fueled the ongoing national debate on abortion.\n\nThe debate on abortion has become increasingly polarized, with extremist views dominating the discourse on both sides. In recent years, the political left has shifted from advocating for the \"safe, legal, and rare\" stance, as proposed by former President Bill Clinton, to becoming more comfortable with more liberal abortion policies.\n\nOn the liberal side, the zeitgeist trend is toward an almost celebratory, in-your-face tone, as seen in the movement \"Shout Your Abortion,\" and the passage of abortion-rights-expanding bills in states like Virginia, New York, and elsewhere.\n\nThe right has responded with its own extreme counterpart, as evidenced by the recent Alabama law, which bans abortion except to protect the life of the mother and imposes serious penalties for abortion providers.\n\nThe debate on abortion also involves a science-based argument, with advancing neonatal research and technology revealing more details about life in the womb. This has complicated the issue, as it denies the luxury of thinking about the fetus as a clump of cells beyond the early weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe silent majority of Americans, often referred to as the squishy middle, is being held hostage by the intractable extremities on both sides. Extremists on both sides are fixated on principle and purity, not on pragmatism, compromise, and real-world concerns.\n\nThe issue of abortion solves itself for moderates in simpler terms: Banning abortion is out of the question because it will only drive it underground, but most moderates can manage their moral discomfort enough to be okay with abortion early in the pregnancy, in cases of rape, incest, and for the life of the mother, and in rare, wrenching cases, later-term abortion to protect the life of the mother.\n\nThe phrase \"the life of the mother\" has meaning, and when supplemented with \"the health of the mother,\" as in the New York law, pro-lifers express concern about the potential abuse of the exception.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision to uphold part of the Indiana law marks a small victory in the ongoing battle over abortion rights. The debate on abortion remains complex and contentious, with both sides holding strong, often extreme views. As the debate continues, it is crucial to respect the science, consider the real-world implications, and find a way to protect both the rights of the unborn and the autonomy of women.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Call for Trump Administration to Outline Syria Strategy Following Missile Strikes\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the U.S. missile strikes in Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar Assad, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are urging the Trump administration to outline a broader strategy for the region.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) told MSNBC on Friday that the current situation in the Middle East is \"the challenge of Bashar al-Assad, and then we have also got the challenge of ISIS.\" He added that there is \"a lot more to go.\"\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged the administration to collaborate and elaborate on the strategy moving forward. \"In the days ahead, I am committed to working with the administration to continue developing a counter-ISIL strategy that hastens the defeat of ISIL and establishes objectives for dealing with the Assad regime in a manner that preserves the institutions of government in an effort to prevent a failed state,\" he said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) stated that it is \"incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it.\"\n\nSenators were scheduled to hold a classified briefing with military and intelligence officials on Friday afternoon. The Senate adjourns for a two-week Spring recess, while the House has already left town for the break.\n\nSome Democrats, as well as at least two Republicans, are questioning the strikes' constitutionality. The military action is reviving debate over Congress's role in the matter and whether the president needs to obtain congressional authorization for any prolonged military engagement in the region.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who favors a more isolationist foreign policy approach, wrote on Twitter that the president needs Congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) echoed Paul's remarks, stating that airstrikes are an act of war and that the Constitution vests in Congress the power to commence war.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a prominent liberal supporter of Congress passing a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF), characterized the airstrikes as \"an act of war.\" She tweeted, \"I was the lone vote against 2001 AUMF. Syria strikes are far beyond the scope of this war authorization. Speaker Ryan needs to bring a vote.\"\n\nPresident Trump, like President Barack Obama before him, has launched airstrikes against ISIS targets using the 2001 war authorization Congress passed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as legal justification. However, lawmakers are split over whether that justification covers attacks against the Assad government.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) stated that the strike was \"appropriate and just\" and signaled that he also wants the Trump administration to consult Capitol Hill lawmakers on the matter. \"I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort,\" he said.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Legislation to Reverse CFPB Auto Lending Discrimination Guidelines\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday signed legislation that will undo a 2013 effort by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to discourage discrimination in auto lending. The CFPB guidelines outlined steps that lenders should take to address discrimination by auto dealers, who often determine the terms for car loans that they help facilitate for their customers.\n\nWith the backing of auto dealers and lenders, Republicans who drove the rollback argued that the CFPB should have followed formal rule-making procedures and sought more public feedback before issuing the guidelines. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law prohibits the bureau from regulating auto dealers. The CFPB guidance was addressed to lenders that fall under the bureau's jurisdiction.\n\nCFPB acting Director Mick Mulvaney praised the move to rescind what he called a \"misguided\" initiative by his predecessor, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. \"I am heartened that the people, through their elected representatives, have corrected this instance of Bureau overreach,\" Mulvaney said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats and consumer watchdogs warned that, in addition to encouraging unfair lending practices, the rollback opened a whole new front in Republicans' deregulation drive under Trump that would be felt well-beyond the CFPB. This marks the first time that lawmakers have successfully used their authority under the Congressional Review Act to kill a regulatory action taken by an agency several years in the past, rather than within a brief window outlined by the 1996 law.\n\nThe congressional move was also novel because the law was used to take down regulatory guidance instead of a formal rule under the Administrative Procedure Act. Agencies issue informal guidance to advise businesses about how laws and rules are being implemented.\n\nAmit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, stated, \"This controversial abuse of the CRA should never have been allowed to happen in the first place.\" He added, \"By signing it, President Trump is turning his back on consumers by giving auto dealers license to discriminate against minorities.\"\n\nMulvaney, who also serves as the White House budget director, said the bureau will \"continue to fight unlawful discrimination at every turn.\" The CFPB said the process clarified that a number of its other guidance documents may be considered rules subject to the Congressional Review Act, and it will \"confer with congressional staff and federal agency partners\" to identify additional documents to submit to Congress.",
    " Title: Strong Economy Favors Trump's Reelection Bid, but Uncertainty Remains\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest job creation figures, with 266,000 jobs added in November and the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, indicate a robust economy that could potentially favor President Donald Trump's reelection bid in 2020. However, the relationship between the economy and presidential approval is complex, and Trump's overall job approval remains low.\n\nIn a CNN poll released last month, Trump's overall job approval was 42%, while 54% disapproved. However, when respondents were asked about Trump's handling of the economy, 52% approved, and 40% disapproved. This is the only area in the poll where a majority of respondents approved of the job Trump is doing.\n\nPresident Trump has consistently touted his economic successes on Twitter, emphasizing the record-breaking performance of the stock market and the economy. In a series of tweets on Friday, he wrote, \"Stock Markets Up Record Numbers...It's the economy, stupid.\" This phrase, coined by Democratic strategist James Carville during the 1992 presidential campaign, has been a recurring theme in American politics, highlighting the significant impact of the economy on voters' decisions.\n\nIncumbent presidents have historically faced difficulty losing reelection when the economy is strong. Presidents such as Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and Gerald Ford have lost reelection bids due to weak or faltering economies. The only other president in the last nine decades to lose a bid for reelection was Richard Nixon, but his case was unique due to his decision to pardon the man he replaced in office.\n\nVoters consistently cite the economy as the most important issue affecting their vote. In the 2016, 2012, and 2008 presidential elections, a majority of voters identified the economy as the most pressing issue. Therefore, if voters believe a president is doing a good job on the economy, they are more likely to reelect that person to keep the economic growth continuing.\n\nHowever, President Trump's overall job approval numbers have not shown a majority approving of his job performance overall. Additionally, Trump's tendency to stray from a focused message could potentially impact his chances of winning reelection. Despite the strong economy, Trump's approval numbers on the economy have been strong for much of the past few years, but his overall job approval numbers have not reflected this.\n\nIn conclusion, the strong economy could potentially favor Trump's reelection bid, but his overall job approval numbers and his tendency to stray from a focused message could impact his chances of winning reelection. The economy is Trump's \"trump card\" with voters, but the question remains whether he knows how and when to play it effectively.",
    " Title: Republican Party's Shift in Strategy: Winning vs. Moral Integrity in Alabama Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Alabama Senate special election, the Republican Party is grappling with the possibility that Roy Moore may secure a victory next Tuesday. This realization has sparked a series of events, with President Donald Trump endorsing Moore and several senators retracting their initial criticisms of the embattled Senate nominee.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump endorsed Moore via a tweet and a phone call, urging him to \"go get 'em!\" In response, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky stated, \"I think we're going to let the people of Alabama decide a week from Tuesday who they want to send to the Senate, and then we'll address the matter appropriately.\"\n\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, traveling with Trump in Utah, further explained Trump's endorsement of Moore, stating, \"I do not think he had any choice but to do that. You know he needs every Republican he can get so he can put his agenda through.\" Hatch also addressed the allegations against Moore, stating, \"Many of the things he allegedly did are decades ago. So it's hard to -- that's a decision that has to be made by the people in that state.\"\n\nThe shift in stance from Republican senators, who initially condemned Moore and called for his withdrawal from the race, is a response to Moore's denial of the allegations and his continued commitment to the race. Additionally, polling suggests that Moore's numbers have rebounded after an initial dip following the allegations, making him a seemingly strong contender.\n\nThis strategy of prioritizing winning over moral integrity has been criticized by some Republicans, such as 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and pollster Matthew Dowd. Romney tweeted, \"Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation,\" while Dowd stated, \"After going all in for Roy Moore, the President, the White House, the GOP, and any of their enablers has zero moral authority to talk about Weinstein, Franken, Conyers, etc.\"\n\nThe issue at hand is the potential long-term damage to the Republican Party's moral standing if they prioritize winning over moral integrity. As Dowd pointed out, \"Winning and power are means to an end. That end is accomplishing the policy goals that a party stands for. Winning is not a goal to be achieved via governance.\"\n\nThe risk for the Republican Party in Alabama is that, by justifying Moore's behavior for the sake of winning, they may sacrifice their moral high ground and potentially damage their reputation in the long term. However, if the people of Alabama elect Moore, it remains unclear whether the Senate would move to expel him, as the last senator to be expelled was in 1862 for supporting the Confederacy.",
    " Title: Senate Rebukes Trump Administration Over ZTE Deal with China, Adds Amendment to Defense Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of the U.S. Senate are set to deliver a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump's efforts to normalize trade with China, as they have added an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that aims to reverse the administration's softening of penalties on Chinese telecom company ZTE. The amendment, co-sponsored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), prohibits the entire U.S. government from purchasing or leasing equipment from ZTE and a similar telecom company, Huawei, cited for national security risks.\n\nThe amendment, if passed, would restore penalties on ZTE imposed in March 2017 after the company was caught selling equipment to Iran and making false statements assuring it had disciplined executives. The punishments included a fine and a seven-year ban on ZTE's ability to purchase U.S. parts.\n\nJohn Cohen, a former acting undersecretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, stated that ZTE represents a major challenge for U.S. counterintelligence authorities. \"China's intelligence agencies regularly embed eavesdropping and other collection tools in technologies sold by Chinese tech firms. China's intelligence services also collaborate with these Chinese tech firms to achieve other intelligence objectives. Allowing ZTE to resume operation will likely cause great concern amongst those intelligence professionals responsible for protecting our national security,\" Cohen, an ABC contributor, said.\n\nThe White House has yet to weigh in on this latest development, but Trump tweeted late last month that the deal with ZTE was more than what his Democratic predecessors had accomplished. While the White House has defended its ZTE deal as tougher than the original, the administration's handling of the ZTE issue has been met with criticism from both sides of the aisle.\n\nSenate Republicans were also upset that the administration had publicly rebuked Canada during the G7 meeting by refusing to endorse a joint statement and accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of negotiating in bad faith. While Canada had already previously announced retaliatory steel and aluminum tariffs on the U.S., it seemed to be Trudeau's comments at a press conference, in which he said Canada would not be \"pushed around,\" that upset the president and his advisors.\n\nSome Senate Republicans are working on a bill that would check the president's ability to impose tariffs on the basis of national security concerns, as he did in the Canada case, without congressional approval. However, the bill, co-sponsored by Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), appears to face procedural hurdles and may not be added to the defense policy bill.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) noted that some Republicans are opting to give the administration space to negotiate with Canada and other partners in the near term, and that it would be best not to try to rein in the president's authority at the same time. \"There's clearly a concern with a lot of sort of free trade conservatives in our conference about the present track that we're on and where it could end up going. But I think at the moment everybody is giving the president the benefit of the doubt,\" Thune said.",
    " Title: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Progressive Lawmakers Plan to Leverage Banking Ties for Policy Change\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been making headlines this month for her aggressive questioning of Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan during a House Financial Services Committee hearing. The freshman lawmaker grilled Sloan over Wells Fargo's involvement in financing projects that have been criticized, such as the detention of migrant children and projects countering the climate change agenda.\n\nAccording to Politico, Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive lawmakers are planning to use similar tactics to advance their anti-Second Amendment agenda and bypass the legislative process. The lawmakers aim to pressure financial institutions into taking a stand on contentious issues like climate change, gun violence, and immigration by \"shaming\" them and leveraging their seats on the House Financial Services Committee and social media following.\n\nOcasio-Cortez admitted to Politico that part of her strategy to bring about change is to apply pressure on banks through means other than legislation. She stated, \"There's more than one way to skin a cat, and not everything has to be done through legislation explicitly. We can also use the tools that we have here to pressure change in other ways as well.\"\n\nIf history is any indication, this strategy could prove successful. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo announced earlier this month they would cut ties with prisons following pressure from Ocasio-Cortez and progressive activists. Last year, the plan was also effective against the National Rifle Association (NRA). In the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida, massacre, millions of Americans boycotted the NRA, which led First National Bank to sever ties with the pro-gun organization, which supplied the NRA with its branded credit card.\n\nKaren Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, told Politico that banks are particularly susceptible to public pressure. \"Banks are acutely sensitive about their reputations because they are in a business acutely susceptible to severe and sudden customer attrition if consumers vote with their wallets,\" she explained. \"As a highly regulated business, banks are also acutely aware of how changing reputations alter their political-risk profile and what Congress can do to them when and if desired.\"",
    " Title: Global State of Civic Engagement: A Look at Recent Experiments and Findings\n\nArticle:\n\nResearchers worldwide are exploring various methods to measure civic engagement, or the level of community involvement, as demonstrated by a recent experiment in Perth, Australia. In this experiment, researchers left 300 letters on the streets, half of which were stamped and half not. Of the 300 letters, 92 of the stamped ones were delivered compared to 42 of the unstamped ones. The aim of the study is to understand why certain communities have higher levels of civic engagement than others, and what factors contribute to building trust and fostering neighborly connections.\n\nSimilar experiments have been conducted in other locations, such as Birmingham, Alabama, where local volunteer groups received small grants of less than $2,000 for neighborhood improvement projects, like removing graffiti. This initiative, funded by the national group Love Your Block, led to a decrease in crime due to increased social cohesion in these neighborhoods.\n\nCivic engagement encompasses a wide range of activities, from community service to voting and even posting a found letter. At its core, civic engagement is characterized by qualities of hope and trust that extend beyond family and friends. While democratic politics and national elections are often considered the primary measures of civic engagement, President Obama emphasized in a 2019 United Nations address that democratic politics should be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, rather than governance by experts from the top down.\n\nIn a 2016 survey of 140 countries, Gallup ranked countries based on the proportion of their population inclined to give back to their communities. Surprisingly, the top ten countries on the Gallup index included more than just wealthy countries. Myanmar topped the list, with Sri Lanka and Indonesia not far behind.\n\nThe survey also found that the most common form of giving back to a community was helping a stranger in need (44%), followed by donating money (27%) and volunteering (20%).\n\nCivic engagement is crucial for social peace and economic prosperity, and finding ways to build more of it can have far-reaching benefits. One potential method to encourage civic engagement could be for cities and towns to drop a few letters on the street to see how many are delivered, as demonstrated in the Perth experiment.",
    " Title: U.S. Places Hold on World Health Organization Funding for Review Amidst Criticism of Handling of Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the United States is placing a hold on funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) for 60 to 90 days, pending a review, following accusations of mismanagement and cover-up in the organization's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDuring a briefing in the Rose Garden, Trump stated, \"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America\u2019s generosity has been put to the best use possible.\" He added, \"If we cannot trust them, if this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals.\"\n\nThe WHO's 2018-2019 budget was approximately $6 billion, with the U.S. being the biggest donor, contributing more than $400 million last year. According to Trump, American taxpayers provided between $400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO, while China contributes roughly $40 million annually.\n\nTrump's specific complaints, which led to the decision to freeze U.S. funding, include the WHO's failure to obtain, vet, and share information in a timely and transparent manner, its failure to investigate credible reports from Wuhan that conflicted with the Chinese government's official accounts, and its delay in declaring a public health emergency, among other issues.\n\nOver the past week, officials within the White House's Office of Management and Budget have been working on a menu of options for how to snub the WHO. The most likely route is to reprogram U.S. funding that was allocated to the WHO, moving it to other international organizations that can administer it for comparable purposes, officials said. A more dramatic, but less likely, approach is to send a rescissions package to Congress, rescinding from the federal budget funds already allocated to the WHO.\n\nAntonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, to which the WHO reports, issued a statement, \"Now is a time for unity in the global battle to push the COVID-19 pandemic into reverse, not a time to cut the resources of the... WHO, which is spearheading and coordinating the global body\u2019s efforts.\"\n\nThe U.S. is the largest contributor to the WHO, providing between $400 million and $500 million per year. The WHO's 2018-2019 budget was approximately $6 billion.",
    " Title: EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson's Alias Email Account Awarded Training Certificates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded training certificates to the fictional staffer \"Richard Windsor,\" an alias used by former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, for completing various technology and ethics training courses, according to documents disclosed last week. The alias, [email protected], was a controversial email address used by Jackson, who resigned earlier this year amid questions about compliance with open-records laws.\n\nThe new records suggest that Jackson used the alias more extensively than previously known, including for required agency computer training under the fake identity. The Windsor account was awarded certificates for completing online email records management training, the 2010 \"No FEAR Act Training Module,\" and a \"Cybersecurity awareness training\" course in 2011, with a score of 83%.\n\nJackson was also recognized as a \"scholar of ethical behavior\" each year from 2010 through 2012. The only training Jackson appears to have done under her own name was for cybersecurity awareness in 2010.\n\nChristopher Horner, a researcher and senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who made the open-records request that led to the release of the certificates, stated, \"At least her alter ego was up on the law and ethics of federal record-keeping.\"\n\nIn a letter acknowledging Horner's repeated prodding, EPA official Eric W. Wachter, director of the office of the secretariat, stated that it was not unusual for Jackson to get certified under her alias, as that was the account she was signed in as when she took the online testing.\n\nEPA officials stated that Jackson kept the secondary address because her main email was published on the agency's website, and she needed a way to conduct agency business that wouldn't get lost in a flood of emails from the public that went to that official account. EPA said previous administrators, including those under Republican President George W. Bush, also had secondary emails for internal use.\n\nHowever, Republicans countered that Jackson took the secondary email further than any of her predecessors, as she did not attach her real name to her secondary account. In response to a request from The \u2588\u2588\u2588, EPA officials could not say whether those prior administrators ever got certified under any of their aliases.\n\nIn a set of emails released to Horner earlier this year, it appears that Jackson used the email to pretend she really was Windsor. Horner argues that the secondary email matters because it wasn't clear that EPA was searching those records in response to open-records requests for Jackson's emails. Horner said that EPA didn't really begin to produce emails from the Richard Windsor account until after he exposed that address.\n\nEPA contends that it did search the Windsor account as part of open-records requests. However, the agency has acknowledged it has fallen short in many transparency areas. In April, acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe wrote a letter telling all agency employees that they must do a better job of storing emails and computer instant messages, as required by law. He said all employees would have to retake training classes.",
    " Title: The Legal Minds Behind the Health Care Case: Rivkin, Casey, McCollum, and Clement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the future of President Barack Obama's health care reform law is poised to leave a significant impact on the court under Chief Justice John Roberts. However, the case also has the potential to define the careers of several legal minds who played a pivotal role in its inception.\n\nIn 2009, when Congress began debating health care reform, the individual mandate, the requirement for nearly all Americans to buy health insurance, was not a significant issue. This changed when a group of conservative legal scholars, including Rivkin and Casey, constitutional lawyers at the law firm Baker Hostetler, began writing articles suggesting the mandate could be the bill's real legal weak spot.\n\nAn op-ed by Rivkin and Casey in The Wall Street Journal in September 2009 served as the catalyst for the legal challenge to the mandate. After reviewing the health law, Rivkin and Casey concluded that the mandate was beyond the constitutional power of the federal government.\n\nWhen it became clear that the 2010 health law was going to pass with a mandate, several states hired Rivkin and Casey to represent them in a lawsuit against the federal government. This lawsuit, which now includes 26 plaintiff states and the National Federation of Independent Business, was filed the day Obama signed the bill into law.\n\nRivkin represented some states in the district court and won, with Judge Roger Vinson ruling that the mandate was unconstitutional, and that the entire law should fall. Rivkin is confident the Supreme Court will rule against the mandate, arguing that the Obama administration has never defined a \"limiting principle.\"\n\nBill McCollum, the Florida attorney general who hired Rivkin and Casey and filed the states' lawsuit against the health law, credits the Rivkin-Casey op-ed with sparking his interest in the issue. McCollum, who was working with then-South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster, asked his fellow attorneys general if they wanted to join. McCollum reported a significant level of interest, with one Democratic attorney general coming close but ultimately deciding not to join at the last minute due to political concerns.\n\nMcCollum, who always thought the constitutional issue would wind up in the country's highest court, was surprised by the suit's intense partisanship. Paul Clement, a former Solicitor General of the United States, represented the National Federation of Independent Business in the Supreme Court. Clement is also expected to play a significant role in the upcoming decision.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on the health care case is anticipated to define the court under Chief Justice John Roberts and potentially shape the careers of several legal minds who helped bring the case to the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Trump Disagrees with Fauci on School Reopening, Criticizes Political Motives Behind Slower Economy Reopening\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo, President Donald Trump expressed his belief that his political opponents want a slower reopening of the economy not due to the coronavirus threat, but to harm him politically in the November election. Trump also criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), on the measures needed to reopen schools.\n\nWhen asked if he thinks his political opponents want him to keep the economy closed going into the presidential election, Trump responded, \"Yeah, I do. I do. I think it's a political thing.\" Trump also disagreed with Fauci on the reopening of schools, stating, \"I totally disagree with him on schools.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Trump criticized Fauci's testimony about reopening schools during a hearing with the Senate Health Committee. Fauci did not necessarily weigh in on whether schools should open, but said it's unlikely a vaccine would be ready in time for the school year.\n\nTrump also noted the United States' progress on coronavirus testing, a major benchmark many experts and governors have said is necessary to hit before moving to lift stay-at-home orders and business closures. Trump also highlighted that young people tend not to get as sick due to the coronavirus and have lower death rates.\n\nHowever, this point, when made by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in the Tuesday Senate hearing, was a concern for Fauci. Fauci expressed that \"We should be humble about what we do not know\" and that \"particularly when it comes to children, because the more and more we learn, we're seeing things about what this virus can do that we did not see from the studies in China or in Europe.\"\n\nTrump also noted that Fauci has supported his earlier move to restrict travel from China in the earlier stages of the coronavirus outbreak. Fauci, in Senate testimony, warned of new coronavirus outbreaks if states jump \"checkpoints\" to reopen.\n\nTrump also criticized the Chinese government, which knew about the coronavirus outbreak when it signed a trade deal with Trump in January. Trump stated, \"I'm very disappointed in China, I will tell you, right now.\"\n\nTrump has been pushing to reopen the economy as quickly as possible, emphasizing the harmful economic effects of keeping businesses closed and people out of work. However, Trump acknowledged health effects of keeping people under stay-at-home orders for such a long time, stating, \"You know, people are dying this way too... they're dying of this closure... where they're in their house or their apartment... they're not allowed to go out.\"\n\nTrump's comments come despite conservative reopening guidelines released by his own administration that Fauci emphasized need to be followed in his Tuesday testimony. Fauci warned that prematurely lifting coronavirus restrictions, closing schools and businesses, and limiting travel would lead to \"suffering and death\" and \"turn the clock back instead of going forward.\"",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Candidates Grapple with Immigration Policy as Key 2016 Campaign Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential campaign is gearing up, and the issue of immigration is emerging as a significant challenge for the Republican party. The Republican field features a diverse range of positions on the question of handling the millions of people residing in the U.S. illegally, in contrast to the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, who has advocated for a pathway to citizenship for many illegal immigrants.\n\nClinton's stance has been forceful, while the Republican field is characterized by a multitude of voices. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who once supported a path to citizenship, now advocates for legal status instead. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was an architect of a broad immigration bill that included a citizenship path, now favors a piecemeal approach. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has reversed his stance on the issue, now opposing a pathway to citizenship, a position he previously supported.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas is a critic of offering citizenship to illegal immigrants, but has not clarified whether they should eventually be allowed to earn legal status. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee both advocate for tightening border security, but are vague about subsequent policy.\n\nAn Associated Press-GfK survey released on May 6 found that 53% of respondents support a path to citizenship, while 50% expressed support for a path to legal status. Among Republicans, only 4 in 10 support allowing immigrants who arrived as children, along with parents of citizens or permanent residents, to legally remain.\n\nThe current stances of GOP candidates also present a campaign issue for Clinton, who, while campaigning this week in Nevada, stated that the Republicans' refusal to embrace a pathway to citizenship would relegate millions of people to underclass status.\n\nImmigration is a crucial issue for Hispanic voters, according to Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. \"Immigration is a unifying issue,\" he said. \"Any candidate who can not speak to that is going to have an uphill climb.\"\n\nPalomarez, whose group is engaging with presidential candidates from both parties, noted that GOP candidates are evolving on this complex issue and are moving away from some of the inflammatory rhetoric used in the past, such as Mitt Romney's 2012 call for illegal immigrants to \"self-deport.\"\n\nThe dynamic within the Republican primary electorate differs significantly from the general-election landscape. For Jeb Bush, past support for a pathway to citizenship could potentially hinder his bid for the GOP nomination. Now, he focuses on granting legal status short of citizenship and overturning President Barack Obama's executive actions.\n\nSenator Rubio, who is Cuban-American, helped write the 2013 Senate bill that included a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants, enhanced border security, and other sweeping changes to the immigration system. He distanced himself from the legislation after it died in the House. Now, Rubio emphasizes the importance of border security and states that nothing can be done to put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship until Americans are convinced the border is secure.\n\nWalker earlier supported immigration legislation that offered a chance at citizenship to people here illegally. He has since renounced that position and argues that the jobs of U.S. citizens could be threatened by giving citizenship to illegal residents and even, potentially, by expanding legal immigration.\n\nResponding to Clinton's call for a pathway to citizenship, Walker stated on Twitter that her \"full embrace of amnesty is unfair to hardworking Americans & immigrants who followed the law to achieve these rights.\"\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) seemed to signal openness to granting legal status to undocumented workers last year, but he ended up voting against the Senate immigration bill that included such provisions, stating it did not do enough to secure the border.\n\nSenator Cruz opposes citizenship for illegal immigrants, but at a session last week with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, he deflected questions about whether he would support a pathway to legal status. Cruz stated that politicians should stay focused on advancing policies where there is consensus.",
    " Title: Media's Portrayal of Hillary Clinton as 'Inevitable' Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe media's portrayal of Hillary Clinton as an inevitable presidential candidate has sparked controversy, with some criticizing her for projecting an aura of inevitability. The media's depiction of Clinton began shortly after the 2012 election, with numerous magazine covers, interviews, and polls suggesting her as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHowever, this narrative has faced criticism, with some arguing that Clinton is repeating the mistakes she made in 2008 by building a campaign machine before having a clear message. Barack Obama's former advisers and strategists have warned that Clinton's strategy is not effective, stating that she should avoid being perceived as the pre-emptive nominee.\n\nWhite House pollster Joel Benenson and 2012 Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt have expressed their concerns, stating that Clinton's top-heavy operation and lack of a clear message could harm her campaign. They argue that activists, donors, and voters prefer to see candidates fighting for every vote, rather than being perceived as inevitable.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Clinton's lead in early polls against potential Republican opponents remains significant. A CNN poll showed her with a 55-39 lead over Chris Christie, while she leads every other major GOP contender by at least 15 points. However, it is important to note that early polls are largely meaningless.\n\nClinton's strategy of remaining low-profile until she officially announces her candidacy is a common tactic for front-runners. However, her unique political persona, as a potential first female president, wife of a controversial ex-president, and a political persona that overshadows all possible rivals, has led to a level of media attention that is unprecedented.\n\nOne of the criticisms leveled against Clinton is her lack of a warmer public persona. In an attempt to address this, Clinton has made an effort to show her warmer side, such as a Super Bowl tweet that poked fun at Fox News. However, this attempt has been met with overanalysis and criticism.\n\nThe biggest challenge Clinton will face, according to some analysts, is that by 2016, many people may be sick of her. She may be perceived as a status quo incumbent, running for a third Obama term, while the Republicans are promising change. This is why a lower-profile 2014 makes sense for Clinton, allowing her to retool for the Twitter age and avoid being overshadowed by the ongoing controversy surrounding the ObamaCare job loss report and the Senate's investigation into the Internal Revenue Service.",
    " Title: White House Warns of Air Travel Delays and Reduced Airport Hours Due to Budget Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has released a list of potential consequences if upcoming spending cuts, known as the sequester, are implemented. The list includes increased forest fires, workplace deaths, and potential chicken shortages, as well as significant air travel delays and reduced hours of operation or temporary closures of some airports.\n\nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood warned of these air travel delays during a briefing, suggesting that smaller airports, such as the one at golfing paradise Hilton Head, South Carolina, might have to reduce hours or close temporarily.\n\nThe Department of Transportation's budget for 2013 is $74.2 billion, and the automatic spending cuts would reduce this by $1 billion, equating to a cut of less than 1.4 percent. It is worth noting that even if the cuts are implemented, the Department of Transportation will spend more money this year ($73.2 billion) than it did last year ($72.6 billion).\n\nSecretary LaHood stated that the Department of Transportation cannot find ways to save $1 billion without sending air traffic controllers home and that they cannot operate effectively with a budget that is larger than the budget they had last year. However, this raises questions about the government's ability to find relatively modest savings without cutting essential services.\n\nWhen asked about finding alternative ways to cut without furloughing air traffic controllers, LaHood responded, \"This has to be a part of it. DOT has 55,000 employees. The largest number of those employees are at the FAA, and the largest number of those employees are controllers, and they're all over the country. There has to be some impact in order to save a billion dollars. A billion dollars is a lot of money.\"\n\nIt is important to note that although the cuts are set to take effect on March 1, most of the impact will not be felt until weeks or even months after that date. Federal employees will receive 30 days' notice that they may have to take unpaid leave (furlough). The first furloughs can therefore not happen until March 31 at the earliest. For employees of the Department of Transportation, the most they will be asked to take is one unpaid day off every two weeks.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney defended the administration's warnings, stating, \"I think all of those things come from reduced, you know, numbers of people fighting fires, you know, reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food, reduced numbers of people, you know, engaging in air traffic control.\" Carney added, \"I mean, those are just the facts.\"\n\nFor more information on the potential consequences of the spending cuts, readers are referred to a list compiled by Chris Good of \u2588\u2588\u2588.",

The meeting was first reported by The New York Times on Saturday and was later confirmed by an attorney representing Trump Jr.\n\nThe meeting, held on Aug. 3, 2016, was a chance for the envoy to offer help to the Trump presidential campaign, according to The New York Times. The newspaper said the meeting was arranged by Erik Prince, the founder and former head of private military contractor Blackwater, who also attended the meeting. Joel Zamel, a co-founder of an Israeli consulting firm, was also in attendance.\n\nAlan Futerfas, Trump Jr.'s attorney, said on Saturday that nothing came of the meeting. \"Prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader, and another individual who may be Joel Zamel. They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it,\" Futerfas said in an emailed statement.\n\nA company connected to Zamel also worked on a proposal for a \"covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign\" to help Trump, utilizing thousands of fake social media accounts, the New York Times report said.\n\nThe envoy, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, told Trump Jr. that the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the 2016 presidential election, the paper said.\n\nSince 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to political campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The campaign financing laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate.\n\nThe Saudi and UAE embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal last month reported that investigators working for U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had met with Zamel, and that Mueller's team was looking into his firm's work and his relationship with Nader.\n\nMueller is investigating whether Russia meddled in the presidential election and if Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign, as well as whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by trying to thwart the U.S. Department of Justice probe. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe New York Times report said the meetings are an indication that other countries besides Russia may have offered help to Trump's presidential campaign. Mueller's investigators have questioned witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv, and elsewhere regarding possible foreign help to the campaign, the report said.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller's team, declined to comment on the report.\n\nZamel's attorney, Marc Mukasey, said in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that his client \"offered nothing to the Trump campaign, received nothing from the Trump campaign, delivered nothing to the Trump campaign, and was not solicited by, or asked to do anything for, the Trump campaign.\"\n\n\"Media reports about Mr. Zamel's engaging in'social media manipulation' are uninformed,\" Mukasey added. \"Mr. Zamel's companies harvest publicly available information for lawful use.\"\n\nKathryn Ruemmler, Nader's lawyer, told the paper that her client \"has fully cooperated with the U.S. special counsel's investigation and will continue to do so.\"\n\nErik Prince, who is also the brother of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, could not be immediately reached for comment.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Resume Trade Talks Amidst Ongoing Disagreements and Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump criticized China for its alleged unwillingness to purchase American agricultural products, accusing the nation of \"ripping off\" the U.S. as negotiations resumed in Shanghai following a three-month hiatus. Trump stated on Twitter that China has not shown signs of buying agricultural products, contradicting the expectation that they would start purchasing these products now.\n\nTrump also mentioned that the U.S. has \"all the cards\" and warned that if he is re-elected in 2020, China will face a much tougher deal. He referred to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as \"Sleepy Joe.\"\n\nChina's state media refuted Trump's comments without naming him, stating that China has no intention of \"ripping off\" the U.S. and has not done so. The People's Daily, the Communist Party's flagship newspaper, criticized the U.S. for threatening China into making concessions, suggesting that this tactic will ultimately fail.\n\nStocks slid earlier in the day following Trump's criticism, with the S&P 500 Index closing lower for a second consecutive day. China's imports of U.S. soybeans dropped to the lowest level since at least 2004.\n\nThe U.S. delegation, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, arrived in Shanghai for another round of talks with their Chinese counterparts. The talks are scheduled to continue on Wednesday in China's bustling port city.\n\nExpectations for a breakthrough in the trade talks remain low, with the two sides further apart than they were three months ago when negotiations broke down. China is pushing for compromise, with state media underlining this week that the U.S. should meet China \"halfway.\"\n\nIt is unclear what triggered Trump's latest outburst. U.S. soybean exports to China slumped in the first half of the year to the lowest level in more than a decade, while pork sales in June decreased from the previous month.\n\nChina has stated that the purchase of American farming products will be contingent on the U.S. following through on Trump's pledge to allow American companies to resume sales to Huawei Technologies Co. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated that he has received more than 50 applications for special licenses for companies to do business with Huawei, and that he and Trump met with \"supply chain\" representatives last week. The administration put the Chinese telecommunications giant on a trade blacklist in May, which means American firms need a special license issued by the Commerce Department to ship to the company.\n\nThe Shanghai talks should help determine whether China will resume negotiations from a draft text agreed before the impasse in May, or wait for the 2020 election, or propose another solution. Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, stated on Tuesday that this could be a \"real suspense.\"",

The incident occurred before the rally, a few blocks away from the venue.\n\nThe rally, ostensibly organized to support Senator Cruz, was also attended by President Donald Trump. However, Cruz seemed to be an afterthought throughout the event, with speakers mentioning him only in general terms. The focus was primarily on criticizing O'Rourke and portraying him as a radical caricature.\n\nTrump, who earlier in the day referred to Cruz as \"Beautiful Ted,\" had a few kind words for Cruz at the rally but was more animated talking about other Republican politicians or subjects. The president spent a significant amount of time discussing the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his administration's record of appointing justices.\n\nIn a separate incident, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly going after a website that sold abortion-inducing drugs. The website, Aid Access, has been shipping the drugs from an Indian pharmacy to women in the U.S. for the past six months, in response to what the site's founder said was an overwhelming demand from American women. The FDA is investigating the website for allegedly bypassing the strict distribution protocol for the drug mifepristone, which can only be distributed at pre-approved clinics, hospitals, and private practices.",

Eisenhower in 1959, makes no direct reference to the Syrian conflict.\n\nIn the proclamation, President Obama stated, \"As individuals rise to demand their universal rights, the United States stands with them in pursuit of equality, justice, and freedom.\" He further declared, \"And as long as there are people who live in the darkness of oppression, America will remain their steadfast friend, linked by a common dream and our common ideals.\"\n\nThe Syrian crisis, where forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have reportedly killed nearly 15,000 civilians in 16 months of open revolt against the regime, is not mentioned in the proclamation.\n\nDouglas Feith, a former undersecretary of defense in the administration of President George W. Bush, criticized President Obama's handling of the Syrian crisis. In an article published Monday in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Feith stated that the Obama administration has not taken significant action, such as establishing humanitarian \"safe zones\" on Syria's Turkish border, providing arms to the rebels, or supporting NATO military strikes against Assad's forces.\n\nRussia, a key ally of the Syrian regime, accused the West of attempting to use blackmail to secure a new U.N. Security Council resolution that could allow the use of force in Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the Kremlin has no intention of supporting a British proposal to enact U.N. sanctions to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe U.S. has consistently supported sanctions, which the Obama administration has stepped up as the crisis has deepened. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also worked with the U.N. Security Council and U.N. envoy Kofi Annan on a June 30 accord calling on Syrians to come up with a political transition.\n\nA mandate for a U.N. observer force is set to expire on July 20, and Mr. Lavrov accused the West of using the deadline as a bargaining chip. \"To our great regret, there are elements of blackmail,\" Mr. Lavrov said. \"We are being told that if you do not agree to passing the resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, then we shall refuse to extend the mandate of the monitoring mission.\"\n\nMr. Feith criticized President Obama for ceding U.S. sovereignty to the United Nations in the debate. \"By refusing to act on Syria, the president is missing an opportunity to advance U.S. security interests in the Middle East, while benefiting Iran, the principal sponsor of the Assad regime,\" Mr. Feith said. \"And by suggesting that America lacks international legal authority to act, he is undermining U.S. sovereignty.\"\n\nIn the \"Captive Nations\" proclamation, President Obama reaffirmed America's commitment to supporting oppressed peoples. \"America renews our abiding ties to all peoples who struggle to claim their inalienable rights,\" the president said. \"As strongly as my administration condemns tyranny, we embrace emerging democracies and welcome the chance to work with those who seek to restore their people's liberty.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Call for International Investigation into China's Handling of COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan push for an international investigation into China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged on Capitol Hill, with Republicans calling for accountability over the Communist Chinese Party's (CCP) alleged cover-up of the virus.\n\nRepresentative Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), two rising stars in the Republican party, have proposed a resolution to launch an international investigation into the CCP's handling and cover-up of the virus, which has turned into a global health pandemic.\n\nSenator Hawley stated in a release, \"Since day one, the Chinese Communist Party intentionally lied to the world about the origin of this pandemic. The CCP was aware of the reality of the virus as early as December but ordered laboratories to destroy samples and forced doctors to keep silent. It is time for an international investigation into the role their cover-up played in the spread of this devastating pandemic. The CCP must be held to account for what the world is now suffering.\"\n\nRepresentative Stefanik is introducing the resolution in the House of Representatives. She stated, \"There is no doubt that China\u2019s unconscionable decision to orchestrate an elaborate coverup of the wide-ranging and deadly implications of coronavirus led to the death of thousands of people, including hundreds of Americans and climbing. This Resolution calls for China to provide compensation for the harm, loss, and destruction their arrogance brought upon the rest of the world. Simply put \u2013 China must, and will, be held accountable.\"\n\nThe legislation's purpose is to not only investigate the knowledge that the CCP had, and declined to share, about the virus, but also to condemn the widespread harm caused by the Chinese government. As of now, Democrats have refused to concede any criticism toward the CCP for the large hand it played in the spread of the virus. However, the communist regime must be held to account for its intentional negligence.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Condemns Rep. Don Young's Use of Offensive Term\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, has condemned the use of the term \"wetbacks\" by Representative Don Young, a senior member of the Republican Party from Alaska, in a statement released on Friday. Young's remark, followed by a quick apology, comes at a sensitive time for the Republican Party in its relationship with Hispanic voters.\n\nIn November, Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Obama, and the GOP is currently navigating calls for changes in immigration law, with more party leaders now backing a so-called path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a position opposed by many conservatives.\n\nYoung used the term \"wetbacks\" in describing Hispanic migrant workers who used to work on his father's family ranch. He made the comments in an interview released Thursday with an Alaska radio station.\n\n\"My father had a ranch. We used to hire 50 or 60 wetbacks and \u2014 to pick tomatoes,\" Young said. \"You know, it takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It's all done by machine.\"\n\nIn a later statement, Young, 79, who has spent four decades in Alaska's only U.S. House seat, said he \"meant no disrespect\" in using the term, a slur for Mexicans crossing illegally into the United States. The Alaska Dispatch reported the apology:\n\n\"During a sit-down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio this week, I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California. I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect.\"\n\nMigrant workers play an important role in America's workforce, and earlier in the interview, Young discussed the compassion and understanding he has for these workers and the hurdles they face in obtaining citizenship. America must once and for all tackle the issue of immigration reform, he added.",
    " Title: Justice Department Declines to File Federal Civil Rights Charges Against NYPD Officer Involved in Eric Garner's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department on Monday declined to file federal civil rights charges against New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in 2014. The decision comes one day before the fifth anniversary of Garner's death and the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n\nGarner, a 43-year-old father of six, was ruled a homicide in August 2014. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" on July 17, 2014, became a national rallying cry for demonstrations about police treatment of minorities. Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, after a meeting with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, stated, \"The Justice Department has failed us.\"\n\nA Staten Island grand jury chose not to indict Officer Pantaleo on any state criminal charges four months after Garner's death. The Justice Department's decision was made by Attorney General William Barr, who took the Eastern District of New York's recommendation not to prosecute over the department's civil rights division's recommendation to move forward with a prosecution.\n\nAccording to a senior official, the decision was made due to the Justice Department's inability to establish the willful intent requirement. The official stated that the legal analysis surrounding Pantaleo's actions would have been different had he been a civilian that had engaged in a chokehold against Garner.\n\nPatrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA) President Patrick J. Lynch commented, \"In both cases, a careful review of the facts led investigators to the truth, although Mr. Garner\u2019s death was an undeniable tragedy, Police Officer Pantaleo did not cause it.\" Lynch further stated, \"Scapegoating a good and honorable officer, who was doing his job in the manner he was taught, will not heal the wounds this case has caused for our entire city.\"\n\nThe PBA President also expressed confidence that if the NYPD decides the disciplinary case on the facts, free of improper political influence, that Officer Pantaleo will be fully exonerated of any wrongdoing.",
    " Title: Twin Explosions Near Iranian Embassy in Beirut Kill 20, Stir Regional Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo explosions near the Iranian embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday have left at least 20 people dead, including an Iranian official, in what some observers are calling a clear sign of deepening sectarian divisions across the region. The attacks are believed to be motivated by the ongoing civil war in Syria.\n\nThe incidents occurred in the southern Jnah district, where the Iranian embassy is located. According to The Los Angeles Times, a \"chaotic scene\" unfolded after two suicide bombers\u2014one on foot and one in a car\u2014detonated their explosives. The BBC reports that at least 100 people were injured, and the Iranian ambassador to Beirut confirmed the death of Iranian cultural attache Ebrahim Ansari, who had been in his post for only a month.\n\nThe perpetrators of the attack are not yet clear, but the Lebanese Sunni jihadi group the Abdullah Azzam Brigades has reportedly claimed responsibility, according to the BBC. The group is said to have sent a \"clear message.\"\n\nThe area has been hit by a series of attacks in recent months, and Lebanon as a whole has witnessed cross-border rocket attacks by Syrian rebels into Shiite areas, deadly car bomb attacks against Sunni and Shiite targets, sectarian clashes, and several roadside bomb attacks against suspected Hezbollah vehicles, according to a report by The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nLebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati told state news agency NNA that the aim of the blast was to \"stir up the situation in Lebanon and use the Lebanese arena to convey messages.\"\n\nIran and Hezbollah, Lebanon's largest political group, are major backers of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, recently announced that the group would continue to send its militiamen to Syria to fight alongside government forces, drawing condemnation from anti-Assad groups in both Lebanon and Syria. Lebanese officials, keen to avoid their nation being drawn into Syria's civil war, have declared a policy of neutrality in the Syrian war.\n\nThe attacks took place in the context of the Syrian government aggressively pushing back against rebel fighters on three fronts, including one in the region of Qalamoun along the Lebanese border, according to The New York Times. There have long been fears that if fighting in Syria continues, it will drag Lebanon into chaos.\n\nHezbollah's involvement in supporting the Syrian government is countered by the involvement of Sunni Lebanese fighting in Syria on behalf of the rebels. In addition, Lebanon, a country of about 4 million people, is now host to upwards of 1 million Syrian refugees.\n\nThe Monitor's Nicholas Blanford wrote a series on the regional stakes of Syria's war and noted that if there is one outright \"winner\" there, it could critically affect Lebanon's stability. It is difficult to envisage an ideal outcome for Lebanon if one side or the other triumphs in Syria. If the Assad regime manages to cling to power and reduce the threat posed by the rebels, Hezbollah will remain strong in Lebanon, and the cross-regional alliance between the Shiite group and its backers in Damascus and Tehran will endure. Such a scenario will deepen Sunni grievances in Lebanon and leave unresolved the continuing domestic debate over Hezbollah's status. If the Assad regime falls and is replaced by a Sunni regime that moves closer to Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Gulf, Hezbollah will be isolated from Iran and will feel dangerously vulnerable. Any move by a newly emboldened Sunni community in Lebanon against a Hezbollah that still would be determined to retain its arms could exacerbate an already precarious security climate. Perhaps the best scenario for Lebanon is a negotiated solution in Syria which compels rival actors to make compromises.\n\nHowever, despite attacks and bombings on Lebanese soil, Syria still isn't tipping Lebanon toward its own civil war, according to The Monitor's Nicholas Blanford.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) expressed her desire to serve as vice president in a recent Spanish-language interview, but acknowledged that her age disqualifies her from holding the position. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that the vice president and the president must be at least 35 years old.\n\nIn the interview with \"Noticias Telemundo\" correspondent Guadalupe Venegas, Ocasio-Cortez, a 30-year-old freshman congresswoman, stated, \"It would be an honor to be vice president, but I can't because I'm not old enough.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez delivered a keynote address at Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) Spanish-language town hall in Las Vegas on Sunday. She endorsed Sanders for the White House in October and could play a significant role in his efforts to secure Nevada's large Latino vote, differentiating him from fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nOcasio-Cortez worked as a community organizer for Sanders during the last presidential campaign, marking her first experience organizing for an election. She described this experience as an important part of her decision to run for Congress.\n\nIn the same interview, Ocasio-Cortez, whose mother is Puerto Rican, emphasized the importance of preserving her Spanish language. She stated, \"If we are first- or second-generation, it is important that we cultivate our language. I must speak and practice more to improve my own Spanish. Our language is the link with our families and our communities.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez had previously expressed nervousness about hosting the town hall in Spanish due to her infrequent use of the language. She also discussed her personal journey over the past year and a half, having worked as a waitress and bartender in a taqueria before being elected as a congresswoman.\n\n\"Last year I worked in a taqueria, as a waitress and as a bartender, and now I am a congresswoman,\" she said. \"That is a huge change. But my values are the same. And we are saying the same thing we were saying last year: that we must fight for working families, for health insurance, for education for all children, and a fair salary.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Warns Russia of Consequences for Actions in Ukraine\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a stern warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, urging him to reverse his actions in Ukraine or face \"grave\" and \"costly\" consequences from the international community. Kerry's statement, delivered in the State Department briefing room, marked the most detailed and direct warning from U.S. leaders regarding Russia's activities in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nKerry outlined a list of covert and destabilizing actions he said Russia has pursued against Ukraine over the past week, including disciplined paramilitary groups occupying Ukrainian government buildings, arrests of undercover Russian intelligence agents, and the kidnappings and murders of local Ukrainian officials and journalists.\n\nPresident Obama, on a four-nation tour of Asia, also warned of tougher economic sanctions from the West and stated, \"We are ready to act.\" Obama's comments followed Putin's Thursday warning to the Ukrainian government that it would face \"consequences\" for moving against pro-Russia separatists in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nAppearing to presage deeper Russian intervention, Putin said Russia would \"have to react to such developments.\" Ukrainian security forces, attempting to clear roadblocks and take back barricaded government buildings in Eastern Ukraine, killed as many as five separatists on Thursday.\n\nKerry's statement suggested a final warning shot, as the U.S., Russia, the European Union, and Ukraine had been meeting last week to forge a stabilization plan to end the Ukraine standoff. However, while the Kiev government was complying with the plan, Kerry said Russia was escalating activities designed to undermine and provoke the Kiev government.\n\nKerry's statement offered numerous examples of the subversion he was referring to, such as paramilitary groups in new but unmarked uniforms occupying Ukrainian government buildings, arrests of undercover Russian intelligence agents, and the kidnappings and murders of local Ukrainian officials and journalists.\n\nInsisting that the world is not being fooled by Russia's \"propaganda\" and \"President Putin's fantasy\" of peaceful but besieged Russian-speaking protesters, Kerry said, \"Russia is stoking the very instability they say they want to quell.\"\n\nPutin and other Russian officials have dismissed the impact of existing or potential Western sanctions on the Russian economy. However, Kerry offered statistics suggesting the Russian economy is already hurting from sanctions imposed over the Crimea annexation. He also cited some Russian officials acknowledging the blow sanctions have already struck, particularly to foreign investment and the confidence of foreign investors in considering Russia in the current climate.\n\nHowever, some analysts are less confident than Kerry appears to be that the \"international community\" will be united in imposing a new round of broader sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy. Experts considering sanctions at a Washington forum sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Thursday underscored that Western Europe remains reliant on Russian energy and is likely to find it difficult to replace that energy in time for next winter.\n\nAdditionally, some experts note that the European Union is not united on imposing broad sector sanctions, and that some Europeans could be sympathetic to a Russian claim, if it moved into Ukraine, that it acted to restore order where a civil war threatened.\n\n\"I can imagine the Russians claiming they acted to stop the unrest and reestablish order, and if they take that to the Germans and maybe some others, that could fall on some sympathetic ears, and we could see some breaks in a united Western front,\" says Nikolas Gvosdev, a specialist in Russian security affairs at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I. \"That would put Obama in a tough spot.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Urged to Provide Diplomatic Support for Guaid\u00f3, Avoid Military Intervention in Venezuela\n\nThe Venezuelan crisis has escalated as the Maduro regime continues to destabilize the country, with the United Nations estimating over 5 million Venezuelan refugees by the end of this year. The United States is urged to provide diplomatic and logistical support for Juan Guaid\u00f3, the interim president recognized by many world governments, while avoiding military intervention.\n\nGuaid\u00f3, who has not been arrested by the Maduro regime despite recent arrests of hundreds of opponents, is facing increased pressure as Tuesday's actions may prompt the regime to take action against him. The odds of Guaid\u00f3 ending up dead, in jail, or in the presidential palace are seen as significantly higher due to the escalating conflict.\n\nThe key to resolving the crisis appears to be whether the military will abandon the regime, as officers and soldiers who join the revolt risk being targeted if the government prevails. Those who remain loyal to Maduro may face less severe consequences if he falls, as the new government may find it more urgent to bring them on board than to punish them.\n\nThe U.S. posturing is seen as potentially tainting the opposition, and there is concern that strong words may lead Guaid\u00f3 and his supporters to believe that Washington will use force on their behalf. This could induce them to take unwise risks and potentially lead to U.S. involvement in a foreign conflict where interests and understanding are minimal.\n\nIn the 2020 U.S. presidential race, Elizabeth Warren is noted for providing more detail on Medicare financing than her competitors, including Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. However, her Medicare plan, which forces people to join, is seen as a weakness due to the sizable public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system. Warren is urged to come up with a reassuring transition plan soon.\n\nFinally, the impeachment inquiry against President Trump is focused on the circumstances and context of his actions, as there is no explicit quid pro quo proposal regarding the restarting of aid. The investigation will determine whether there is enough evidence to support impeachment and removal from office.",
    " Title: US Senate Passes Tax Cuts Bill, Marking First Major Legislative Victory for President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has passed a sweeping tax cuts bill, marking President Donald Trump's first significant legislative victory. The package, which represents the biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s, was passed by a vote of 51 to 49 after a series of amendments in a marathon session.\n\nThe bill, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, sees a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate, from 35% to 20%. The measures were passed despite a non-partisan Senate Joint Committee on Taxation warning that the bill would add $1tn (\u00a3742bn) to the budget deficit over a decade.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a similar bill last month and will now need to merge their legislation with the Senate's version before it can be signed into law by the president. The House and Senate must then smooth out differences in their bills and vote on the compromise.\n\nPresident Trump, speaking at a New York fundraiser on Saturday, said, \"So last night we passed in the history of the country, the largest tax cuts and reform... We're going to grow the country, we're going to grow jobs. We're going to be growing everything.\"\n\nThe move is a significant victory for President Trump, who has faced challenges in getting major legislative movement in Congress, including his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. His presidency has also been marked by an independent investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US election and possible collusion with his campaign team. On Friday, former national security adviser Michael Flynn became the Trump administration's most senior member to be charged in the investigation.\n\nThe Senate, a seemingly insurmountable roadblock for the Republican agenda for much of this year, has at last given its assent to a major piece of legislation. The bill was not without controversy, with Senate negotiators making last-minute amendments to the massive bill up until the final votes were taken.\n\nMost Americans across all income levels would see modest tax breaks until 2026, and the Senate Joint Committee on Taxation said after that families earning under $75,000 a year would likely face higher taxes. Some opponents highlighted a measure that would end a requirement introduced under Obamacare for most taxpayers to buy health insurance or face a fine.\n\nThe final draft of the bill went through several changes in order to bring reluctant Republicans on board. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the Senate. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate tax rate would be permanently lowered from 35% to 20%, while future foreign profits of US-based firms would be mainly exempt from tax.",
    " Title: Congressional Delegation Tours Tornillo Tent City, Calls for Closure of Immigrant Teen Facility\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of five Democratic members of Congress, led by Representative Beto O'Rourke, toured a remote tent city in West Texas on Saturday where approximately 2,700 immigrant teenagers are being held at a daily cost of around $1 million. The lawmakers urged the nonprofit running the facility not to renew a federal contract that expires on December 31, a move that could potentially shutter the camp.\n\nThe group, which included Senators Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tina Smith of Minnesota, and California Representative Judy Chu, was not allowed to speak to the children in a meaningful way during the visit. O'Rourke, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, expressed concern about the children's lack of engagement and described the facility as a \"child prison.\"\n\nTornillo, located just outside El Paso, Texas, has taken on a permanent feel with soccer fields, a dining facility, and separate sleeping quarters for boys and girls. The facility was initially intended to be a temporary solution during an alleged emergency situation on the U.S.-Mexico border, but it has since grown in size and taken in more children.\n\nO'Rourke made no mention of his potential White House aspirations after making his fourth visit to the camp. He noted the area's remote location, stating that it was intentionally isolated to keep the American public unaware of the conditions within the facility.\n\nThe lawmakers reported that the contractor running the facility, BCFS Health and Human Services, has cost taxpayers $144 million since its opening. The Democrats urged BCFS Health and Human Services to refuse to renew its contract with the U.S. government, but they were unsure where the children would be transferred if the facility were to close.\n\nThe lawmakers described touring the tents housing the teenagers but were only able to ask light questions. O'Rourke reportedly asked a few of the children about their countries of origin, and they responded with Guatemala and Honduras. The children reportedly assured him that the conditions were \"OK.\"\n\nTornillo opened in June as a temporary facility amid the Trump administration's description of an emergency situation on the U.S.-Mexico border. Since then, the contract keeping it open has been renewed, and the number of children being held inside has grown, though the rate of growth has been difficult to determine.\n\nThe lawmakers reported that many of the teenagers have family members already in the United States who wish to take them. However, federal authorities have conducted fingerprinting and background checks on would-be \"sponsors,\" resulting in 170 apprehensions on possible immigration violations. The contractor also reported that 1,300 children have relatives ready to take them but have remained at Tornillo due to unexplained federal delays.\n\nPublic pressure could potentially force federal authorities to close Tornillo, according to O'Rourke, but in the meantime, federal policies are causing the country to \"turn our backs on these people.\" The Associated Press previously reported that the Trump administration waived FBI fingerprint checks for caregivers and experienced short-staffing in mental health workers at Tornillo.",
    " Title: Trump's New Negotiating Strategy Yields Government Reopening, Raises Questions for Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe three-day government shutdown ended Monday night, with President Donald Trump adopting a more reserved approach during the impasse. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized the president, stating, \"The great deal-making president sat on the sidelines.\" However, it was Schumer who ultimately led a retreat on the shutdown, a move that many Democrats attributed to the White House's new strategy.\n\nPolitico reported that the president's \"stand-back-and-watch\" approach was effective, putting pressure on Senate leaders to reach an agreement to reopen the government without White House intervention. This strategy reportedly delivered Trump a significant victory.\n\nIn his new book, \"Media Madness: Donald Trump, The Press, And The War Over the Truth,\" Fox News \"MediaBuzz\" host Howard Kurtz reveals that Trump aides have coined a term for the president's tendency to act against advice: \"Defiance Disorder.\" The phrase refers to Trump's apparent compulsion to act against the advice of his advisers, leaving his team to manage the fallout.\n\nDuring the government shutdown negotiations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) advised Trump not to engage with Democrats like Schumer to strike a grand bargain. Instead, Trump followed McConnell's advice, and the new strategy proved successful.\n\nThe government shutdown strategy's failure also sparked a mini-civil war within the ranks of congressional Democrats. Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.), a strong advocate for immigrants, criticized Senate Democrats for blinking during the standoff. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) questioned the Senate's motives, while House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) confirmed their concerns.\n\nAfter a year in office, Trump aides believe they have new tools in their negotiating arsenal. One White House aide stated, \"No one is saying Trump won't be Trump, and he knows how to pivot and attack better than anyone. But he is also figuring out that timing is everything, and you sometimes have to wait and let your adversaries trip over themselves.\"\n\nDemocrats have historically dealt with a president who overreacts to taunts and provocations. However, they lost this time due to the president's change in tactics and his ability to outmaneuver them. As the midterm elections approach, Democrats may come to realize that the 71-year-old Trump has learned new tricks and may surprise them again.",

The rally was held a day after Romney's remarks on the Libyan and Egyptian unrest sparked a debate.\n\nRomney began his speech by expressing his condolences for the four American diplomats who lost their lives in the recent attacks, including Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other embassy staffers. He emphasized the tragic loss of these individuals who had served the country with distinction.\n\nDuring the speech, a heckler interrupted, questioning Romney's politicization of the Libya situation. The crowd attempted to drown out the heckler with chants of \"Mitt\" and \"U-S-A!\". In response, Romney said, \"I would offer a moment of silence, but one gentleman does not want to be silent, so we're going to keep on going.\"\n\nPresident Obama, meanwhile, traveled to Golden, Colorado on Thursday, where he spoke about improving the economy and vowed to find those responsible for the death of Ambassador Stevens. He stated, \"I want people around the world to hear me: To all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world.\"\n\nIn a development on Thursday, Libyan officials informed the U.S. that four individuals were in custody in connection with the attack.\n\nDuring his speech in Virginia, Romney reiterated his vision of a strong United States that \"shapes events\" in the world.

Pastor John Paul Walker of St. Mary's Parish, which comprises both St. Mary's Catholic Church and St. Joseph's Catholic Church, announced in a Thursday Facebook post that St. Joseph's Church was vandalized between 9 p.m. on Wednesday and 6 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Hartford also confirmed the incident via a Facebook post, stating that \"a person or group of persons had painted anarchist and satanic symbols on the doors of St. Joseph Church in New Haven.\"\n\nPastor Walker wrote in his post that this incident appears to be part of a trend of desecrating Catholic spaces across the nation, citing incidents in Chattanooga, Queens, Boston, Sacramento, and Ocala. He described the underlying motive of these sacrilegious attacks as an attempt to intimidate and instill fear in those who worship Christ.\n\nThe pastor expressed confidence in the resilience of the Catholic faith, which has endured for over 2,000 years, and stated that the church would continue to pray for the conversion of hearts of those who wish to terrorize them. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe New Haven police did not immediately respond to requests for comment from \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation on the matter.\n\nThis report follows the confirmation by Fr.

    " Title: Trump's Job Approval Rating Drops Amid Economic Concerns and Recession Fears\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by ABC News and The Washington Post shows a decline in President Donald Trump's job approval rating, with six in ten Americans expressing concerns about a potential recession and higher prices due to the trade war with China. Trump's approval rating has dropped from a career-high 44% in July to 38% currently, marking a significant decrease in public support.\n\nThe poll indicates that Trump has slipped by 5 percentage points specifically on his handling of the economy, with 46% now approving of his economic management compared to 51% in midsummer. Furthermore, only 35% approve of his handling of trade negotiations with China, and 60% are concerned that the trade dispute will raise the price of goods they purchase.\n\nThe overall rating of the U.S. economy, at 56% positive, has decreased from 65% last fall in this poll. Notably, 60% of respondents see a recession as very or somewhat likely in the next year, which is close to the 69% who expressed similar concerns in November 2007, prior to the Great Recession.\n\nIn another measure, Trump receives far more criticism than credit for his economic stewardship. Americans by nearly a 3-1 margin, 43-16%, say his trade and economic policies have increased rather than decreased the chance of a recession in the next year.\n\nEconomic attitudes are found to be highly partisan, with 90% of Republicans rating the economy positively, compared to 52% of independents and 33% of Democrats. One in three Republicans sees a recession as very or somewhat likely in the next year, while this rises to 60% of independents and 83% of Democrats.\n\nThe statistical analysis, called regression, supports these findings. Controlling for demographics, partisanship, and political ideology, seeing a recession as more likely independently predicts lower approval for Trump, as do both being concerned about paying more because of the trade dispute with China and holding more negative views of the economy overall.\n\nEconomic anxiety is nearly as high in the red states Trump won in 2016 as in the blue states, with 58% in red states seeing a recession as very or somewhat likely, compared to 63% in blue states. Trump's overall approval rating is underwater in the red states, 43%, compared to 32% in the blue states.\n\nThe president's approval rating varies widely among groups, with significant declines in approval among urban residents, college graduates, and women. Trump's approval rating is 47% among men, 30% among women, and he has lost 10 points among urban residents, 9 points among college graduates, and 8 points among women since July.\n\nTrump's approval rating among white men who don't have a college degree remains high at 69%, but he has lost 12 points among non-college white women, to 42%, and 15 points among college-educated white men, to 34%. College-educated white men and women now express similar levels of criticism towards the president.\n\nLastly, Trump has 82% approval among Republicans, back near his career average after peaking at 87% in July. Trump's approval rating is 8% among Democrats, and among independents, it is 36%.\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted from September 2-5, 2019, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. The results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 28-24-37% Democrats-Republicans-independents.

    " Title: Senate Considering Additional Sanctions on Iran's Nuclear Program\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is currently discussing potential further sanctions against Iran in response to concerns about Iran's nuclear program. If diplomatic efforts fail to persuade Iran to dismantle or significantly reduce its nuclear program, the new sanctions would provide the President with the authority to swiftly and decisively pressure Iran into a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\nHistorically, the Senate has played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy, with key decisions such as the Alaska Purchase in 1867, the United Nations' establishment in 1945, the Marshall Plan in 1948, and the authorization of World War I, World War II, and the Persian Gulf Wars.\n\nThe Senate's role in foreign policy has been instrumental in the careers of numerous influential politicians, including J. William Fulbright, Chuck Percy, Jacob Javits, John Kerry, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe current discussion on additional sanctions against Iran stems from the potential threat a nuclear Iran poses to regional stability and global security. Iran is reportedly close to developing an atomic bomb, which would significantly increase its influence in the Middle East and potentially threaten countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDomestically, the Iranian nuclear program enjoys broad support among the Iranian population, with 80% of Iranians favoring the program. Nuclear weapons would also deter any potential Western intervention, as seen in 1941 and 1953, when the Iranian regime was not overthrown.\n\nA nuclear Iran could trigger an arms race in the Middle East, with several countries likely acquiring nuclear weapons. This would embolden radical Islamist forces in the region and discourage more moderate, pro-American states, potentially leading to increased instability.\n\nBy 2020, Iran may possess Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the East Coast of the United States. Before then, Iran may be able to target Western and Central Europe with nuclear weapons.\n\nThe diplomatic effort to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program is crucial to American national security, as tough sanctions have already brought Iran to the negotiating table for the first time. Iran's economy is highly vulnerable to economic sanctions, as indicated by its low ranking in various global economic and business indices.\n\nThe effectiveness of sanctions in compelling Iran to negotiate has been demonstrated in the past, such as during the 1987 Iran-Iraq War, when Grand Ayatollah Khomeini ended the war under extreme economic pressure. Similarly, the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 led to a slowdown in Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe new round of sanctions is expected to provide President Obama with the leverage needed to compel Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.",
    " Title: U.S. Accuses Qatar of Cheating on Airline Subsidies, Raising Concerns for Trade Deals\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed additional tariffs on selected goods imported from China, following through on the president's campaign promise to secure fair trade deals. Critics argue that tariffs, which are essentially taxes, lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers and provide a safe haven for inefficiencies, shielding markets and manufacturers from the need to innovate and increase productivity.\n\nHowever, the administration's strategy seems to have yielded results, as new trade deals are being discussed with Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Canada. The tariff strategy has been successful in the past, and the administration claims it is a short-term measure to pressure China into protecting American intellectual property.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is facing a different challenge with Qatar, a self-proclaimed U.S. ally and host to the largest American military base in the Gulf. Qatar is allegedly circumventing an Open Skies agreement, which aims to enable open entry into a nation's airspace, by operating Air Italy, a carrier it purchased a 49% share in and rebranded.\n\nAir Italy, which offers bargain-rate flights to several U.S. cities, is using Qatari aircraft, financing, and personnel, leading U.S. carriers and lawmakers to accuse Qatar of cheating on the agreement. American advocates on Capitol Hill, including Senators Ted Cruz (Republican) and Bob Menendez (Democrat), are urging the Trump administration to take action against Qatar.\n\nIf Qatar Airways continues to use Air Italy as a proxy, it could send a message to other major U.S. trading partners that they can agree to trade deals and cheat without consequences. This issue underscores the need for the U.S. to hold Qatar accountable, not just for its own actions but for the message it sends to other nations.",
    " Title: Indictment Alleges Negligence in Jeffrey Epstein's Death, Citing Overtime Shift Lapses by Correction Officers\n\nArticle:\n\nAn indictment has been unsealed, alleging negligence in the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who was found dead in his jail cell on August 10, 2019. The indictment, released on Thursday, details the actions of two correction officers, Tiffany M. Doe (Ms. Noel) and Thomas B. Kiernan (Mr. Thomas), on the night of Epstein's death.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas were both working overtime shifts on the day of Epstein's death. Ms. Noel, a correction officer since 2016, and Mr. Thomas, who started in 2007, were supposed to check on Epstein and other inmates every half-hour.\n\nThe indictment states that Epstein was escorted into his cell by Ms. Noel and another guard shortly before 8 p.m. Inmates were locked in their cells for the night by 10 p.m., but the indictment alleges that between 10:30 p.m. and the following morning, Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas did not perform their duties. Instead, they reportedly sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the common area. They also allegedly signed \"count sheets\" stating they had checked on inmates multiple times overnight, when they had not.\n\nThe indictment further claims that when Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas entered Epstein's cell the following morning, they found him unresponsive with a noose around his neck. When a supervisor arrived, the guards admitted they had not properly performed their duties.\n\nKathleen Hawk Sawyer, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, released a statement saying the agency is taking the allegations of misconduct \"very seriously\" and that they \"will be responded to appropriately.\"\n\nThe indictment does not specify the nature of the charges against Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas. The full details of the indictment are yet to be made public.",
    " Title: White House Announces Executive Order to Raise Minimum Wage in New Federal Contracts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Obama will announce during his State of the Union address tonight that he will sign an executive order raising the minimum wage in new federal contracts from the current national minimum of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. The change applies only to new federal contracts and not to renewals of existing agreements.\n\nThe announcement comes as the White House, under the leadership of senior adviser John Podesta, is reportedly adopting a more executive-focused approach to governance. According to Podesta, the White House and the Justice Department agree that Obama has the authority to take such executive actions in the coming year, where there is agreement between the two bodies.\n\nDuring the State of the Union address, which begins shortly after 9 p.m. ET, Obama will also renew his push for an increase in the federal minimum wage for all workers. In addition to discussing the executive order, Obama will make the case for a bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan, and touch on signs of economic recovery, outlining the administration's plans for continued growth.\n\nThe White House has been proactive in using executive orders to advance its agenda, particularly in areas such as retirement security, climate change, and energy transformation. Podesta stated that across a wide range of topics, there is a lot that Obama has the authority to do. However, there will likely be arguments about whether some such actions usurp congressional powers and are therefore unconstitutional.\n\nFor further preview of the State of the Union address, please refer to this post from It's All Politics: 5 Things To Expect In Obama's State of the Union Address.

    " Title: Putin Claims Convincing Trump on Russia's Non-Involvement in U.S. Election\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin stated on Saturday that he believes he managed to convince President Donald Trump that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The discussion regarding Russian meddling in the election was the primary topic during the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders on Friday.\n\nDuring the meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, Mr. Putin reiterated his denials that Moscow was involved in the election interference. \"He asked many questions on that subject,\" said Mr. Putin. \"I answered those questions as best I could.\"\n\nMr. Putin provided his assessment of Mr. Trump's reaction during a press conference in Hamburg. The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin was overshadowed by the ongoing controversy surrounding Russian interference in the election and unsubstantiated allegations of Trump campaign collusion.\n\nPresident Trump has faced criticism for expressing doubt about Russian interference in the election, despite several U.S. intelligence agencies believing Russia was responsible. Mr. Trump stated on Thursday that he believed Russia was involved but that other countries or individuals could also have been involved.\n\nThe interference included the spread of disinformation during the campaign, as well as hacking into emails at the Democratic National Committee and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign officials, exposing embarrassing information. However, there is no evidence that the efforts impacted the outcome of the election.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who attended the meeting, said Mr. Trump opened the discussion by pressing Mr. Putin about election interference and a \"very robust and lengthy exchange\" ensued. \"The president pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement,\" he said.\n\nThe highly anticipated sit-down, which was scheduled for 30 minutes but lasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes, also covered a Syrian cease-fire agreement, Russia's disputed annexation of Crimea, and the fight against ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nMr. Putin stated at the press conference that he believed he and Mr. Trump could cooperate on a range of issues. \"As for personal relations,\" said Mr. Putin, \"I think that they are established.\" He added, \"I think that if we continue building our relations like during our conversation yesterday, there are grounds to believe that we'll be able to \u2014 at least partially \u2014 restore the level of cooperation that we need.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Mr. Putin delivered his remarks in an interview with the Russian news network RT. In fact, he delivered his remarks at a press conference.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucuses Reveal Next President Will Not Be a Governor\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa caucuses have narrowed the field of potential Republican presidential candidates, with the next president unlikely to be a governor. This development is surprising, as a year ago, many predicted the next president would be a Republican governor.\n\nInitially, the frontrunners were expected to be former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, or Texas Governor Rick Perry. If these candidates failed to gain traction, Ohio Governor John Kasich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee were ready to step in. Perry, in particular, had a strong narrative, having created more jobs in Texas than all other states during his tenure as governor.\n\nHowever, Walker, Jindal, and Huckabee have since dropped out of the race, leaving Bush, Kasich, and Christie as the remaining contenders. These three candidates combined received approximately the same number of votes as surgeon Ben Carson, who finished in fourth place. Despite Bush spending millions in Iowa, these three candidates are considered nonentities. They are now pinning their hopes on a strong showing in New Hampshire, with Kasich being the only one with a viable chance.\n\nThe decline of the governors can be attributed to the public's disdain for politicians and their experience becoming a liability. Even their successes were dismissed. The more John Kasich boasted of his impressive budget-balancing feats, the more conservatives concluded that he had been in office for too long.\n\nJeb Bush, who was arguably the most qualified for the Oval Office, was criticized for his perceived lack of conservatism despite his record of tax cuts, school choice initiatives, and pro-life stance. The governors' campaigns were also criticized for being tone-deaf to voter anger, with Bush's focus on fundraising and Kasich's acceptance of Medicaid funds from Obamacare being particular points of contention.\n\nDespite the current political climate, governing effectively should not be a liability. Governors have demonstrated their ability to cut taxes, balance budgets, and implement reforms. The art of politics involves finding common ground and working with opposing parties to achieve policy goals. Ronald Reagan, a steadfast conservative, was able to make deals and achieve bipartisan support for his policies.\n\nThe three remaining candidates, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, have yet to govern. While they are admirable in their own right, the lack of governorship experience is a concern. It remains to be seen whether one of these candidates will tap a governor as their running mate to balance their lack of executive experience. The talent pool of governors is deep, and there are many capable individuals who could contribute to a successful administration.",
    " Title: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sets Final Deadline for Trump Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on Saturday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) set an April 23 deadline for the IRS to provide President Donald Trump's tax returns. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has stated that the administration is studying the legal questions involved, without confirming whether they will meet the deadline.\n\nIf the deadline passes without the documents or a resolution to the dispute, House Democrats and the Trump administration could potentially face a court battle. The administration missed an earlier April 10 deadline, with Mnuchin citing consultations with the Justice Department regarding the law and the legitimacy of Neal's request.\n\nUnder the tax code, Neal is entitled to receive the six years of business and personal returns of Trump that he requested, according to Neal's letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. Neal argued that the law clearly entitles him to the requested tax returns and return information.\n\nIn his letter, Neal stated, \"It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury, or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information.\"\n\nIf the IRS fails to hand over the records by the April 23 deadline, Neal has indicated he may issue a subpoena or seek to enforce the law in federal court. The legal question would extend beyond the language of the statute and consider the extent of constitutional constraints on legislative inquiries.\n\nMatthew Leas, an IRS spokesman, declined to comment on Neal's letter. Mnuchin stated that Treasury officials are working diligently on the legal issues, and he expressed concerns about the potential weaponization of the IRS.\n\n\"This is a decision that has enormous precedence in potentially weaponizing the IRS,\" Mnuchin said at the conclusion of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington. \"The implications of this is way beyond, in my mind, a congressional oversight issue and a president issue. The issue is, I feel a responsibility that we get this right and the IRS does not become weaponized like it was under the Nixon administration.\"\n\nTrump has broken with four decades of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns. He has stated that he would release his returns after an audit is complete. Although a public release might complicate his audit, no law prevents Trump from revealing his returns at any time.\n\nNeal has used the president's argument against a voluntary release and turned it into his rationale for a mandatory handover of the returns, arguing that the committee needs to determine if the IRS is conducting the audits properly. Neal has also requested administrative files relating to any audits of the president or some of his business entities.\n\nA subsequent committee vote would be required to publicly release all or part of the returns. The administration has not formally denied Neal's request, but Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, has stated that Democrats would \"never\" receive the returns. Trump's personal lawyer, William Consovoy, has urged the IRS to resist the request.",

This marks the fourth consecutive day of triple-digit moves for Wall Street. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 32.31 points, or 1.6%, to finish at 1,965.99. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended down 88.47 points, or 1.9%, at 4,466.75.\n\nThe decline was primarily driven by a 3.8% drop in Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which closed below $98. The tech giant's shares have fallen for two consecutive days due to reported issues with its new phones and operating system.\n\nThe Dow gained 154 points on Wednesday, but all other triple-digit moves since it set a new closing high on Friday have been downward. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have also been down for four out of the past five sessions.\n\nThe rising volatility on Wall Street is causing concern, as the stock market had previously enjoyed a long period of relatively uneventful trading earlier in September. The \"fear gauge,\" a measure of volatility, jumped 25% on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts are worried about the buildup of complacency among investors and the approach of what could be a disappointing third-quarter earnings season, potentially leading to more trouble in the weeks ahead. However, the current losses are relatively minor, with the Dow and S&P both down roughly 2% from their record highs set last week.\n\nIn economic news, durable goods orders plunged 18.2% in August, largely due to a sharp drop in aircraft orders. Orders for durable goods excluding the volatile transportation category rose 0.7%. Applications for unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 last week, despite the rise, applications remain near pre-recession levels.\n\nAsian markets were mixed, with Japan's Nikkei index jumping 0.3% to 16,734.14 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling 0.6% to 23,768.13.

This online source adjusts public polling data to include more Republicans in the sample.\n\nWhile the traditional political narrative portrays Romney trailing in various national polls, this parallel universe presents a different story. In this alternate reality, Romney is predicted to win by 4 or 5 points in states like Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, according to conservative pundit Dick Morris on Fox News.\n\nConservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh also suggests a more sinister motive behind the media and university polls, claiming they are designed to depress and suppress Republican voter turnout. He argues that these polls are intended to convince the public that the election is already over.\n\nThe divide between Republican political consultants and conservative media figures is well-documented. Operatives must operate in the real world due to their job requirements, while media figures like Morris and Limbaugh have different motivations, such as building their email lists and audience. They often criticize the mainstream media to appeal to their conservative audience.\n\nThe website unskewedpolls.com is not the only example of this alternate campaign reality. Texas Governor Rick Perry has also referenced the site on Twitter, praising its \"unskewed\" information.

    " Title: Trump Legal Team Leans Against President's Interview with Mueller's Team\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's potential interview could mark a significant development in the ongoing Russia investigation. The interview could be the final and most important question in the prolonged standoff between Trump and Mueller.\n\nCritics view Mueller's investigation as a significant distraction for the White House, as the president navigates complex issues such as international trade and a historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. On the other hand, Mueller's supporters argue that he needs to complete his investigation.\n\nOne of the key figures in the investigation, former FBI director James Comey, is expected to face scrutiny in an upcoming report by the Justice Department inspector general. According to ABC, a source claims the draft report labels Comey as \"insubordinate\" for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email probe.\n\nComey played a role in initiating Mueller's probe, having leaked some of his conversations with President Trump in an attempt to prompt a special counsel investigation into Russia.\n\nThe investigation has raised several questions, including whether the president has the power to pardon himself, a topic that has divided legal experts. However, the most pressing issue remains whether the president will agree to an interview with Mueller's team. Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, stated in an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Founder Pat Robertson that the legal team is leaning against the interview.\n\n\"I have to just be honest,\" Giuliani said. \"We're leaning toward not [agreeing to testimony]. But look, if they can convince us that it would be brief, it would be the point, there are five or six points they have to clarify. And with that, we can get this over, this long nightmare for the American public over.\"\n\nIf Mueller subpoenas Trump to testify, it would not be due to Giuliani's team accepting the subpoena, and this could lead to a lengthy legal battle potentially reaching the Supreme Court.

    " Title: John W. Dean Discusses Watergate: A Comprehensive Account of the Mother of All Modern Political Scandals\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn W. Dean, former counsel to the president during the Nixon White House, discusses his book \"The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It\" and his biweekly column for Verdict at Justia.com. Dean was interviewed by Wolf Blitzer on CNN during the 6 p.m. hour on Wednesday, and the story of Watergate will be featured on CNN's \"The Seventies\" at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nDean, who was in the middle of the Watergate scandal during his tenure as White House counsel, has spent the past 40 years studying the extensive record of the Watergate scandal as it has gradually surfaced in testimony, autobiographies, diaries, released documents, secret tape recordings, FBI investigative files, grand juries, Senate Watergate and House impeachment committees, and extensive federal court civil and criminal records.\n\nDean questions whether the nation wants to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, particularly Watergate. The scandal began on June 17, 1972, with the arrest of five burglars dressed in business suits, carrying new $100 bills and electronic bugging equipment, during President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign. When one of the men arrested was identified as the director of security for the Committee to Reelect the President, suspicion immediately focused on the Nixon White House.\n\nAs the cover-up unfolded, Dean, who was out of the country at the time, returned to Washington and understood that a cover-up was being launched. He learned that the same men involved in the Watergate break-in had undertaken an earlier operation for the White House by breaking into and ransacking the files of a psychiatrist treating Daniel Ellsberg, who had leaked the Pentagon Papers a year earlier.\n\nDean states that while he has never found any evidence that Nixon knew in advance of or ordered the Watergate break-in, he does know that Nixon had ordered an earlier break-in at the Brookings Institution when he believed they had a copy of the Pentagon Papers. The tapes and written documents show that had the Watergate burglars not been arrested at the Democratic headquarters on June 17, they would have gone on to their true mission that night, which was to break in and bug the campaign headquarters of Nixon's Democratic opponent, Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota.\n\nWatergate did not end with Nixon's resignation and departure from the White House on August 9, 1974. Rather, it played out for many months more in headline-grabbing events during the cover-up trial of his top aides, including former chief of staff H.R. \"Bob\" Haldeman, former top domestic affairs adviser John D. Ehrlichman, and former attorney general John N. Mitchell, who would be found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice on January 1, 1975.\n\nDean admits his own guilt in the cover-up and believes that only the truth can help the nation learn from the past. He was unwilling to write the bogus report about Watergate that the President wanted him to write and told him everyone involved needed to resign. He was fired, and when the President and his former colleagues sought to make him their scapegoat, it did not work out so well - Dean had the truth on his side, as the tapes proved.\n\nThis segment of CNN's series on the 1970s tells this story as it happened. CNN, Playtone, and HBO have not only told the story honestly but have uncovered video footage of the events long buried in archives, bringing to life memorable moments from these historic events. The program is informative, engaging, and accurate.",
    " Title: US Calls for De-escalation as G7 Agrees on Swift Sanctions Against Russia Over Ukraine\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has reported that Russian military aircraft have entered Ukrainian airspace on multiple occasions, amid escalating tension in eastern Ukraine. A Pentagon spokesman has called for Russia to \"de-escalate the situation.\" The statement was issued as the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized countries agreed on Saturday to swiftly impose new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 joint statement emphasized the need for Russia to take \"concrete actions in support of the Geneva accord.\" However, they noted that Russia has yet to comply with the agreement, which was signed last week, calling for separatists to vacate official premises and surrender their weapons.\n\nThe G7 statement also expressed concern over the seizure of international observers by separatists in Ukraine. Negotiations are currently underway to secure the release of these observers, who were seized by separatists.\n\nRussia has tens of thousands of troops stationed along its border with Ukraine, with pro-Moscow separatists occupying official buildings in a dozen eastern towns, defying the government in Kiev. Russia has accused the West of attempting to seize Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren stated that Russian aircraft had entered Ukrainian airspace several times within the past 24 hours. He provided no further details but urged Moscow to take \"immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel previously described Russian activity along the Ukrainian border as \"dangerously destabilizing\" and \"very provocative.\"\n\nLast weekend, Ukraine and Russia reached an agreement in Geneva, calling for separatists to leave official premises and give up their arms. The pact included an amnesty for those who left peacefully. However, pro-Russian activists have so far refused to comply with the demands.\n\nThe unrest in Ukraine began last November over whether the country should lean towards Moscow or the West. Last month, Russia annexed Ukraine's mainly ethnic-Russian Crimean peninsula, following a referendum in the region that supported joining the Russian Federation but was deemed illegal by the West and Kiev.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine's interior ministry reported that armed separatists had seized seven representatives from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), as well as five Ukrainian army personnel and a bus driver. Pro-Russian leaders in Sloviansk confirmed the bus had been stopped near the town of Sloviansk and were checking the identities of those on board.\n\nThe self-proclaimed mayor of Sloviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, stated that at least one passenger had been carrying maps showing separatist checkpoints in the area, which suggested \"their involvement in espionage.\"\n\nTensions have risen in recent days as Ukraine launched military raids to regain occupied buildings. At least two separatists have been killed in these raids, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described as a \"bloody crime.\" Mr. Lavrov repeated the accusation made previously by Moscow that Ukraine is waging a war against its own people.",
    " Title: Trump's China Policy: A Closer Look at the Challenges and Potential Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's policy agenda, particularly his stance on trade with China, has been a subject of concern for many, with fears of a potential trade war and its impact on the global economy. During his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week, Trump reiterated his concerns about alleged unfair trade practices by China.\n\nWhile a full-blown trade war between the two largest economies would have immediate and negative consequences for workers and consumers worldwide, the global trade system has deep-seated flaws that are related to China, not Trump. For years, China has been welcomed into global trade linkages, with the expectation that it would play by the rules of commerce as other nations do. However, trade experts argue that China has not lived up to these expectations, violating both the letter and spirit of global trade rules.\n\nTrump's election win, in part, stemmed from the resonance of his critique of trade policies as harmful to U.S. workers. While outside experts may not share the president's broad brush, some argue that a tougher stance toward China is needed. A damaging trade war may not be the most likely outcome, and the \"just be patient\" strategy carries its own deep risks.\n\nRobert Atkinson, an economist who studies the ties between global trade and national economic performance, argues that China is a unique challenge due to its size and its determination to leverage its market power to acquire a leadership role in advanced industries, from aerospace to computing. When Beijing doesn't play by accepted rules, the damage to other nations, including the U.S., is considerable.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative ramped up its engagement on alleged violations by China. The USTR's annual report covering 2016 lists settlements reached with China last year over subsidies, taxes, or other policies in industries including aircraft, autos, financial information, wind power, and green technologies. This signifies that progress can be made when pressure is applied.\n\nHowever, critics of China's trade policies argue that much more needs to change. One of the biggest sore spots is the way foreign companies doing business in China are pressured to transfer knowledge to Chinese partner firms in industries such as aerospace. The World Trade Organization prohibits countries from making such demands, yet the Chinese arrangements are, in practice, hard to prosecute.\n\nEdward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, notes that the issues are not just about manufacturing jobs but about making China a fairer partner for the world. Jamie Dimon, CEO of the banking firm JPMorgan Chase, also singled out China for \"serious trade issues\" in his annual letter to shareholders.\n\nAs Trump and Xi met at the Trump-branded Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, there were few early signs of either progress or breakdown. The outcome of their discussions remains uncertain, with Trump himself stating that \"we've had a long discussion already, and so far I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing. But we have developed a friendship \u2013 I can see that \u2013 and I think long term we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it.\"\n\nThe friendly comment raises questions about whether Trump will go soft on China, as some critics suggest some of his predecessors have. However, it's too early to gauge the tenor of Trump's policies, with his trade team still incomplete and some of his appointees differing in tone. One crucial decision will be how much to seek a broader international coalition to press China. Trump has voiced a penchant for bilateral dealing and dealmaking, but many experts argue that working with allies is more effective than working alone.\n\nAtkinson argues that the goal isn't to block China's development but to insist on a rule-of-law system under which all parties can benefit. Coupled with innovation policies to maintain America's dynamism at home, such a strategy could avert the potential loss of key industries. \"When we have pushed the Chinese in the past, in a respectful but firm way with our allies, we have prevailed,\" Atkinson says.",

The victory, however, has been described as a statistical tie, with Clinton receiving 49.9% of the vote and Sanders receiving 49.6%. The margin of victory in the delegate count was decided by six coin tosses, which have been a source of controversy among Sanders' supporters.\n\nClinton's victory has been met with criticism and complaints from Sanders' supporters, who allege irregularities and biased coin tosses. A crushing defeat would have been worse for Clinton, but this close result has not been much better. The nature of this victory has led to lawyerly qualifications and caveats from Clinton's campaign, and her supporters have been criticized for overselling the win and appearing disconnected from reality.\n\nThe close results of the Iowa caucus have raised concerns about the Democratic Party's future. The ghost of Eugene McCarthy, a left-wing senator who challenged President Johnson in the 1968 New Hampshire primary, has been invoked as a reminder of the potential for a left-wing candidate to challenge a sitting president. However, in this case, Clinton is not an incumbent president, and the close results in Iowa and New Hampshire may not have the same impact.\n\nThe close results in Iowa have effectively ended any possibility of a Democratic savior entering the race to challenge Clinton and Sanders. With Clinton's victory in Iowa, it is likely that she will go on to lose in New Hampshire and then grind out a victory over many months, potentially antagonizing Sanders' supporters. The Democratic Party is now stuck with the candidates they have, and the close results in Iowa have raised concerns about the party's ability to unite and win in November.\n\nJonah Goldberg, an American Enterprise Institute fellow and National Review contributing editor, is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588's Board of Contributors.

    " Title: US Deploys Additional Troops to Southern Border, Bringing Total to 4,300\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Defense has announced the deployment of an additional 2,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, bringing the total number of troops stationed there to approximately 4,300. The soldiers will assist border-patrol agents, carry out surveillance work, and install miles of razor wire.\n\nThe decision comes amidst President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Congress over funding for a proposed wall along the border. The President has emphasized the need for such a measure to curb illegal immigration. The President's insistence on including wall funds in the U.S. budget led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. A temporary deal was struck last month to reopen government departments, but the President has threatened to initiate another shutdown or declare a national emergency if his demands are not met. The current agreement expires on February 15.\n\nPresident Trump is expected to address the issue in his annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday. The U.S. Department of Defense initially announced that 3,750 extra soldiers would be sent to the border, with many replacing troops already there. The first deployments took place in November.\n\nAccording to a Pentagon statement, these troops will perform tasks such as providing a mobile surveillance capability through September 2019 and emplacing approximately 150 miles of concertina wire between ports of entry. Last Thursday, President Trump tweeted that extra forces were being sent to the border to stop migrants traveling in \"caravans\" and threatening an \"invasion.\" He reiterated his claims on Sunday, tweeting, \"If there is no wall, there is no security.\"\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly described the situation on the Mexican border as a \"crisis,\" although his critics have dismissed the use of troops as a political stunt. It is worth noting that President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 National Guard soldiers to guard the boundary, while President George W. Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol agents in what was called Operation Jump Start.\n\nIn related news, officials in Texas recently revealed that nine migrants on hunger strike at an immigration detention center were being force-fed. Immigration officials are using plastic nasal tubes to feed some of the men, but relatives claim this is causing severe nosebleeds and vomiting. The detainees have refused food in protest against conditions at the El Paso Processing Center. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says a federal judge authorized the force-feeding last month.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Email Practices During Tenure as Secretary of State Found to Disregard Cyber Security Guidelines\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a report by the State Department's Inspector General (IG), it has been found that Hillary Clinton, during her tenure as Secretary of State, disregarded cybersecurity guidelines when she used a private computer server for official communications. Clinton has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has falsely claimed that she turned over all her emails to the State Department after leaving office.\n\nHowever, it was discovered that Clinton, or members of her team, deleted about 30,000 of these emails before an investigation began. The IG's report criticizes Clinton, stating that she should have preserved any federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing them with the related files in the Office of the Secretary.\n\nThe IG's report also mentions that Clinton did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act. The report suggests that Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service.\n\nThe IG's report also highlights Clinton's resistance to government requests for access to her server, which was located in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home, with another discovered at an unsecured location in a Denver bathroom closet. Marcel Lazar, a Romanian computer hacker known as \"Guccifer,\" claimed to have hacked into Clinton's servers. Lazar pled guilty to the charge before a Virginia judge this week.\n\nHillary Clinton has claimed that she only used private email for her daughter's wedding and yoga classes. However, this claim has been met with skepticism, as high-ranking government officials are aware of the regulations governing their tenure while in office and their responsibilities for the handling of records once they leave it.\n\nThe IG's report also refutes Clinton's defense that she complied with the necessary notifications when a user suspects compromise of a personally owned device containing personally identifiable information. The IG found \"no evidence\" that Clinton or her aides complied with this requirement.\n\nFor years, the Clintons have been accused of skirting laws and practicing disinformation, obfuscation, changing the subject, non sequiturs, and other tactics to block their enrichment or achievement of political goals. This time, it is crucial that Hillary Clinton is not allowed to evade accountability for her actions, and her incidents of malfeasance should not be rewarded by being elected as the President of the United States.",
    " Title: President Obama to Deliver Major Economic Speech in Midwest, Avoids Detroit Bailout Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will travel to the Midwest this week to deliver a major speech on economic revival, bypassing Detroit, which has been a subject of controversy due to its bankruptcy status and the ongoing debate over a potential federal bailout. The president will visit Galesburg, Illinois, and Warrensburg, Missouri, to promote his domestic agenda, with an address at Knox College in Illinois.\n\nThe speech, set for Wednesday, will outline the president's vision for rebuilding an economy that prioritizes the middle class and those striving to join it. White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer stated that the president's speech will \"kick off a series of speeches that will lay out his vision for rebuilding an economy that puts the middle class and those fighting to join it front and center.\"\n\nThe speech is also intended to help the president regain control of his second term, which has been overshadowed by scandals such as Benghazi, secret surveillance, and the abuse of Internal Revenue Service powers. According to Pfeiffer, the president will discuss economic steps he will take on his own, steps that Congress should take, and actions that private industry can accomplish to bolster the economy. He also aims to set the terms of the debate for upcoming budget and debt limit battles with Congress.\n\nThe plight of Detroit, facing over $18 billion in debt and significant pension obligations, has dominated economic news in recent weeks. Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection on Thursday. Some, including former \"car czar\" Steven Rattner, have called for federal intervention, but the White House has not indicated plans to provide financial aid to the city.\n\nVice President Joe Biden expressed less certainty, stating that \"we don't know at this point\" whether the administration can help Detroit. He added that aides are studying the details. In April, Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, met with senior White House officials, but no formal bailout request was made, and no offer was put on the table.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing was approved by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, but a judge in Michigan ruled on Friday that the bankruptcy filing violates the state's constitution and must be withdrawn. The state's Attorney General, Bill Schuette, is appealing the ruling.\n\nDuring his re-election campaign last year, Mr. Obama emphasized his role in saving Detroit's auto industry with an $80 billion federal bailout in 2009. However, Michigan's congressional delegation has not pushed for a federal bailout for the city.\n\nIn addition to the economic speech, President Obama will use the stops in Illinois and Missouri to make his case for spending on infrastructure and for universal preschool programs. He is also expected to highlight the economic benefits of comprehensive immigration reform. The White House chose Knox College as the site of Mr. Obama's speech because it was the same place where he delivered his first economic speech on the national stage as a U.S. senator in 2005.",
    " Title: Moderate House Republicans Call for Compromise on Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nSome House Republicans, facing challenging reelection prospects in 2014, are softening their stance on the government shutdown, advocating for compromise and moving away from the fight over defunding Obamacare.\n\nVirginia Rep. Scott Rigell stated, \"Republicans fought the good fight. The fight continues but is not advanced by a government shutdown that damages our economy and harms our military.\" He called for a \"clean CR\" to reopen the government. Pennsylvania Rep. Pat Meehan said, \"I came to Washington to fix government, not shut it down. At this point, I believe it's time for the House to vote for a clean, short-term funding bill to bring the Senate to the table and negotiate a responsible compromise.\"\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Jon Runyan also expressed a similar sentiment, stating, \"Enough is enough. Put a clean (continuing resolution) on the floor and let's get on with the business we were sent to do.\"\n\nLawmakers like Rigell, Meehan, and Runyan, who represent moderate districts, may have the most to lose if the American public turns against the House GOP's role in the shutdown. Rigell's military-heavy district, encompassing the Hampton Roads area, was narrowly carried by President Barack Obama in 2012. Mitt Romney won Meehan's suburban Philadelphia district by a slight margin. Obama carried Runyan's south central New Jersey district by four percentage points.\n\nRigell, Meehan, and Runyan join two other Republicans from moderate districts \u2013 New York Rep. Peter King and Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent \u2013 who have been vocal in trying to persuade the House GOP to abandon its fight.\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo, who represents an Atlantic City-area seat that Obama won by eight percentage points, has expressed discontent with the House GOP's strategy. The 10-term congressman was quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer as saying, \"At a certain point, if the strategy is not going to get us a result or a conclusion, I'm not going to go along with it...I want to see a result. The bigger fight's coming on the debt limit.\"\n\nAnother endangered Republican, Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, stopped short of urging his party to concede but emphasized his desire to reach an agreement. Davis, a freshman incumbent who represents a nearly evenly divided district between Democrats and Republicans, stated, \"Like most of those I represent, I remain opposed to Obamacare, but a government shutdown is absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nA host of vulnerable GOP incumbents have faced criticism from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which, on Tuesday, launched an automated call campaign criticizing them and 60 other Republicans over the shutdown. The DCCC also labeled Davis as a member of the \"Too Little, Too Late Caucus.\"",
    " Title: American Health Care Act Addresses Key Obamacare Issues, Despite Criticism from Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Health Care Act, the first iteration of the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), has faced criticism from conservatives since its inception. The editors of Investor's Business Daily argue that the bill \"supports all the key elements of Obamacare.\" However, a closer examination of the bill reveals that it addresses several key issues that conservatives have long been advocating for.\n\nThe American Health Care Act repeals the individual mandate, effective after December 31, 2015. This means that Americans who failed to buy health insurance coverage last year will not owe any penalties, fines, or taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The bill also repeals the employer mandate, which will no longer require employers to provide health insurance coverage to their employees.\n\nThe bill also eliminates several stealth taxes imposed by Obamacare. For example, it eliminates the tax on over-the-counter medications, a tax that was previously hidden within the Affordable Care Act. The bill also repeals Obamacare's cap on contributions to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), which were unlimited before the advent of President Obama's \"signature domestic achievement.\" This cap was particularly hard on parents of special needs children, many of whom used FSAs to pay for special needs education.\n\nThe bill also eliminates the high medical bill tax, the tax on early withdrawals from Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and the medical device tax, a natural-born job killer. The list goes on, with the bill addressing numerous issues that conservatives have long been advocating for.\n\nDespite these positive attributes, conservatives and libertarians have been critical of the bill. One point of contention is the 30% premium surcharge that the bill would allow insurers to charge patients who wait until they are ill to buy coverage. However, it is important to note that this surcharge is an incentive for individuals to make informed choices about their health care, rather than an outright requirement to buy health insurance.\n\nAnother point of contention is the bill's tax credits and subsidies. However, it is important to note that the bill's tax credits are designed to help individuals and families afford health insurance, rather than the unworkable system of subsidies under Obamacare.\n\nThe American Health Care Act also defunds Planned Parenthood and reforms Medicaid, two provisions that conservatives have long been advocating for. The benefits of defunding Planned Parenthood are obvious, as the taxpayers will no longer be forced to fund the world's most notorious abortion mill and purveyor of infant body parts. The Medicaid reforms, which include a Medicaid per capita block grant and an increase in the amount of money individuals can contribute to HSAs, are a crucial part of conservative healthcare policy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the American Health Care Act is not perfect, it addresses several key issues that conservatives have long been advocating for. If conservatives hold out for full repeal and cling to the fantasy of a free market replacement plan, there is a real danger that Obamacare will never be repealed. Instead, it is important for conservatives to recognize the positive attributes of the American Health Care Act and work towards further reforms to achieve a truly free market healthcare system.",
    " Title: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Claims Responsibility for Charlie Hebdo Attack, French Authorities Investigate Paris Kosher Market Siege\n\nArticle:\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last week, according to a video released on Wednesday. The attack, which left 12 people dead, was years in the making, an AQAP leader said in the video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it. Al-Awlaki, who was a spokesman for AQAP before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011, is believed to have had ties with the gunmen who attacked the magazine.\n\nIntelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the gunmen met al-Awlaki on trips to Yemen, a theory that could be bolstered by the new video's claim. AQAP did not claim responsibility for Friday's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in Paris, but praised it.\n\nFrench security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice, a man from a Paris suburb, may have driven gunman Amedy Coulibaly to the kosher supermarket, where Coulibaly later shot dead four people. Coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege. Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers who authorities say were behind the Charlie Hebdo attack, are also dead.\n\nInvestigators' efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week's attacks are continuing. Charlie Hebdo's new edition hit newsstands Wednesday, a week after authorities say terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down staffers. The cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed crying. All 3 million copies sold out quickly, but more copies are coming soon, the magazine said.\n\nThe claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, with pictures of the Kouachis in the background. Al-Ansi praised the attack, saying it was revenge for Charlie Hebdo's depictions of Mohammed. Al-Ansi blamed not only Charlie Hebdo, but also France and the United States.\n\nU.S. authorities said they think the video is authentic. But they were not ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. \"We're not there yet. There are good indicators that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing,\" a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nInvestigators believe Cherif Kouachi left Yemen with as much as $20,000 from AQAP to carry out attacks, a U.S. official said. Le Parisien's report said investigators identified Coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend. Also found inside the apartment, according to Le Parisien: a stash of weapons, explosives, and two ISIS flags.\n\nCoulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to ISIS. Police also suspect the man may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week\u2014an attack that the Paris prosecutor has said could be tied to Coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack, Le Parisien said. Paris police would not comment to CNN on the contents of the report.\n\nLe Parisien says Coulibaly's accomplice, who the newspaper did not name, is suspected to have fled France, possibly for Syria. Officials have also said they believe Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly's widow who may have played a role in the attacks, has fled to Syria.\n\nWith France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. Since the attacks, dozens of cases have been opened in France against people accused of expressing support for terrorism since the attacks, the Justice Ministry said. It's unclear how many people are blamed for the 54 infractions. The cases include investigations involving phone threats, cyberattacks, and Facebook posts, the ministry said. Some are in prison awaiting trial, some have already been convicted, and some have been released with a notice of a court date, ministry spokesman Pierre Rance said.\n\nJustice Minister Christiane Taubira \"considers that words or actions of a racist or anti-Semitic nature, or that cause hateful, violent, or discriminatory behavior, or advocate terrorism, or target security forces must be fought and pursued with the utmost vigor,\" her office said in a statement. She \"asked prosecutors to exercise extreme reactivity in the conduct of public action against the perpetrators of such crimes,\" the statement said.\n\nWith concerns on the rise, a controversial French comedian was accused of publicly supporting terrorism, French media reported. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, known as Dieudonne, was arrested in Paris, according to media reports, which tied his arrest to a recent Facebook post from the comedian. \"Je suis Charlie Coulibaly,\" the post said, combined the last name of one of the terrorists involved in last week's attacks with the widely used phrase expressing solidarity with victims. On Monday, Dieudonne issued a statement with his stance on the terror attacks. \"Since the beginning of last year, I have been treated as public enemy number one, when all I try to do is make people laugh, and laugh about death,\" he wrote in a letter to the French interior minister. \"Because death laughs at us all, as Charlie knows now, unfortunately.\"",
    " Title: Political Campaigns Employ Personalized and Targeted Emails for Fundraising\n\nArticle:\n\nPolitical campaigns are increasingly using personalized and desperate-sounding emails to make final fundraising pleas, according to a recent report by FoxNews.com. One such email, with the subject line \"Need to reach you,\" mimics the tone of a plea from a stranded friend or family member.\n\nBill Scheel, part of the campaign for Arizona Democratic gubernatorial candidate Fred DuVal, acknowledges that such emails are part of a trend to connect with potential donors in a more specific way. \"We want to be as personal as possible,\" he told FoxNews.com. \"It's all part of a tremendous science that is now very important to campaigns.\"\n\nHowever, Scheel notes that the DuVal campaign draws the line at sending \"doom and gloom\" emails, such as one this summer from the Tea Party Patriots that began with the line, \"The tears are starting to flow.\" Scheel argues that such messages send the wrong message and that the DuVal campaign focuses on sending positive and upbeat messages.\n\nFormer Bush campaign and White House aide Taylor Griffin argues that the science goes beyond subject lines to include email content and all of social media. He points out that technology has been a game-changer in voter contact, allowing campaigns to personalize and segment messages to specific voters based on their interests and issues.\n\nCampaigns typically hire firms that specialize in voter outreach, including phone canvasing, culling voter rolls, and acquiring membership lists. For example, a straightforward, pro-gun message could be sent to potential voters listed in the membership rolls of a Second Amendment advocacy group.\n\nGriffin also highlights the power of Facebook in crafting narrowly focused messages to potential voters. Candidates can place a specific ad on the Facebook homepage of specific, potential voters based on their Internet profiles, which includes their shopping habits and websites they have visited.\n\nOne email that particularly resonated with message-weary voters this year began with the subject line, \"Would You Like Us to Leave You Alone?\" This inbox chestnut was sent eight days before election night by the Conservative Campaign Committee. The email's narrative, while initially compelling, eventually transitioned to a standard fundraising pitch.\n\nScheel understands how such emails could frustrate recipients, but notes that the DuVal campaign and others allow recipients to unsubscribe. He also points out that too many unopened or rejected emails can create problems for campaigns with Internet watchdogs. \"It's not to our advantage to keep sending emails that people won't open,\" Scheel said.",
    " Title: GOP Health Care Reform Bill in Jeopardy as Key Senators Express Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo prominent Republican senators have admitted that the initial GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is likely \"dead.\" The statements were made during interviews on Sunday, July 2.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ) suggested in a televised interview on CBS that it may be time for Republicans to collaborate with Democrats to create a new health care reform proposal. \"I think my view is it's probably going to be dead,\" McCain said of the GOP bill. If Democrats are involved, he said, it does not mean they control the process; it means their amendments will be considered. \"That's what democracy is supposed to be all about,\" McCain added.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), speaking on \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday,\" told Chris Wallace, \"We don't know what the plan is. Clearly, the draft plan is dead. Is the serious rewrite plan dead? I don't know.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) also expressed pessimism, signaling on Twitter late Saturday that Republicans would lose their Senate majority if they do not pass health care legislation. Grassley added that the party should be \"ashamed\" for not being able to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPresident Trump used Twitter on Sunday afternoon to urge Republicans to fulfill their pledge to repeal the health care law. \"For years, even as a 'civilian,' I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nAt least 10 GOP senators have expressed opposition to the initial bill drafted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate, and Democrats stand united against the bill. With just three GOP defections, the bill would be doomed. The weeklong July 4 recess only raised more doubts among senators as many heard from constituents angry about the GOP bill and the prospect of rising premiums.\n\nMcConnell last week said he would introduce a fresh bill in about a week, aiming to scuttle and replace much of former President Barack Obama's health care law. However, McConnell also acknowledged that if the broader effort fails, he may turn to a smaller bill with quick help for insurers and consumers and negotiate with Democrats.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz's (R-TX) plan, which aims to lower premiums for healthy people, has drawn support from the White House and some conservatives in the House. However, his proposal has limited appeal to Republican moderates such as Grassley, who told Iowa Public Radio that it may be \"subterfuge to get around pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nCruz, on Sunday, sought to dismiss Grassley's criticism as a \"hoax\" being pushed by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. Cruz insisted that people will be able to get the coverage they need at an affordable price. Cruz cast his plan as a compromise to unify the Republican party on a GOP health bill.\n\n\"When it comes to repealing Obamacare, what I think is critical is that Republicans, we've got to honor the promise we made to the voters that millions of Americans are hurting under Obamacare,\" Cruz said. \"In my view, failure is not an option,\" he added.",
    " Title: New Book on Fox News Executive Roger Ailes Sparks Controversy Ahead of Release\n\nArticle:\n\nA new book titled \"The Loudest Voice in the Room,\" authored by New York Magazine contributing editor Gabriel Sherman, is set to be published by Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch's AP Random House on January 21. The book promises to offer a controversial new perspective on Fox News.\n\nIn anticipation of potential backlash, the publisher and author are reportedly preparing for it, with a new website promoting the book also serving as a source for countering misinformation throughout the book's release. According to the website, Sherman conducted over 600 interviews with individuals who have interacted with Ailes, including hundreds of Fox News insiders.\n\nThe website features caricatures of many in Ailes' world, from Rupert Murdoch, dubbed \"The Mogul,\" to \"Champ,\" described as Ailes' guard dog. The book's release coincides with USA Today's Michael Wolff's piece, \"The Unbeatable Roger Ailes,\" which focuses on Fox News' 2013 ratings triumphs. Last year, Fox's audience outpaced both MSNBC and CNN combined.\n\nThe cable news audience, despite the attention it receives for its potential political influence, is relatively small. The average Fox prime-time audience in 2013 was little over a million people, while MSNBC's 2013 non-election-year prime-time viewership was 640,000, and CNN's was 568,000. The book, which has been in the works for over two years, does not include interviews with Ailes.\n\nIn August, after Brian Lewis, a senior adviser to Ailes, was fired, Sherman speculated that it meant Ailes was \"more isolated than ever before\" \u2014 an assertion that Fox News executives quickly refuted. The exact details of Ailes' involvement in the book are unavailable.",
    " Title: Iowa Democratic Leadership Remains Split on Clinton's Presidential Bid, Expressing Concerns Over Electability and Fundraising Ties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe state of Iowa, which derailed Hillary Clinton's presidential aspirations in 2008, is once again proving to be a challenging ground for the former First Lady as she prepares for a new presidential campaign. A report in Monday's Wall Street Journal revealed that Iowa's Democratic county leaders are reluctant to coalesce behind Clinton and have expressed concerns about her ability to win a general election and her fundraising ties to Wall Street firms and corporations.\n\nMany county officials have expressed a preference for senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont to enter the race, although they are divided over whether any of these candidates could gain traction and overtake Clinton. Jennifer Herrington, chair of the Page County Democrats in southwest Iowa, stated, \"My heart wouldn't be in it for Hillary to the extent that it might be if it was a different candidate. I admire Hillary, she'd be a great president, but you know, she isn't my first choice I guess.\"\n\nIowa's Democratic electorate mirrors its Republican counterpart, as demonstrated in the 2012 election when Mitt Romney came in a narrow second place behind former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. For all of Romney's 24.5% of the Iowa vote, another three-quarters backed a non-establishment candidate. A narrow loss for Clinton in Iowa could spell disaster for her second presidential bid, but a serious challenge to Clinton seems remote at this point.\n\nHowever, some Democrats who want to see Clinton challenged in a primary are also laying the foundations to blame her for a 2016 defeat if a challenge does not materialize. Local Democrats note that the energy, donations, and political infrastructure acquired during a contested primary also become critical tools to use in the general election. Without these, the Democratic nominee is likely to be at a disadvantage when the vibrant and ideologically diverse GOP concludes its primary contest.\n\nWhile the argument that a party that undergoes a contested primary is a stronger party is a valid contention, Clinton is unlikely to welcome a serious challenge. Memories from Iowa in 2008 are still fresh, and anti-Clinton forces, too, seem resigned. Those disaffected liberals who are prepared to accept her coronation are also preparing to consign the name Clinton to history's dishonorable scrap piles should she lose. It would be a bitter irony that the name Clinton, one which for the last 20 years has been associated with reviving the moribund Democratic brand, might soon become synonymous with its destruction.",
    " Title: Churches Face Financial Crisis During Holy Week Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe traditional Holy Week commences tomorrow with Palm Sunday, and across the United States, many churches are closed, either voluntarily or by government decree. This closure has led to a financial crisis for numerous churches that rely almost entirely on donations from worshippers for their survival.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Newark (New Jersey) has established an online GoFundMe donation page, allowing anyone to contribute to specific parishes or a more general \"Parishes in Need Fund.\" Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin stated in a statement on the page, \"Our parishes face increased risk of financial shortfalls due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects on everyday life.\"\n\nHoly Week is a significant source of donations for these churches, with a substantial portion of the funds used to support charitable work. Priests and clergy provide food for hungry families, pay rent for those in need, and fund various other charitable activities made possible by these donations.\n\nBishop Robert Casey of the Archdiocese of Chicago expressed concern, stating, \"It's a homecoming time for us, but it's also a very important fundraising time that allows us to continue with our mission and our ministries. This Holy Week will be especially worrisome for our parishes.\"\n\nIn addition to funding charitable needs, donations are crucial for payroll, church employees, and third-party employee contracts, including maintenance workers and cleaning staff. Father Paul Vigil of St. Timothy's Catholic Church in Los Angeles stated, \"The last thing we want to do is lay off anyone or furlough especially during this time.\"\n\nThe Archdiocese of Los Angeles is encouraging parishes and schools to avoid furloughs and layoffs and is calling on parishioners to support extending unemployment benefits to church workers, who, in many states, do not have access to state unemployment insurance.\n\nWith tightened economic circumstances, asking parishioners to donate during difficult times has always been challenging. Father Vigil added, \"When families barely have enough to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads, as much as they may love the church, they just can't give what they might normally give.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, churches will continue their work, having survived previous economic downturns, wars, and now the COVID-19 pandemic. The historical generosity of the American people will help them persevere, with enough devout believers to continue what they see as God's work on earth.",
    " Title: U.S. President Donald Trump Accused of State-Sponsored Murder of Iranian General Qassim Suleimani\n\nArticle:\n\nThe assassination of Iranian Major General Qassim Suleimani, a high-ranking official of the Iranian government, has been labeled as a state-sponsored murder following the U.S. drone strike last week. The incident has sparked controversy and accusations that President Donald Trump is a murderer, with some arguing that this action violates the long-standing U.S. assassination ban.\n\nThe assassination ban was established in the 1970s following the Church Committee's investigation, which revealed that the CIA had secretly attempted to assassinate foreign leaders, including Cuba's Fidel Castro. At the time, the assassination ban was not the accepted practice of a democracy that aimed to serve as a role model for the world.\n\nHowever, over the past two decades, both Republican and Democratic presidents have worked to skirt the assassination ban by taking advantage of new technologies to find and kill individuals worldwide. To do so without violating the ban, presidents have relied on compliant government lawyers to issue secret legal opinions that provide legal cover for their actions.\n\nThe Clinton administration initiated this practice in 1998, in response to the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa by Al Qaeda. The White House launched cruise missile strikes against what they claimed were terrorist training camps near Khost, Afghanistan, with the primary target being Osama bin Laden. At the time, the New York Times reported that the action did not violate the assassination ban because the target was the \"command and control infrastructure\" of Al Qaeda, which was interpreted as its leadership, including bin Laden.\n\nAfter 9/11, political concerns about the assassination ban were largely set aside due to overwhelming public support for the new global war on terror. However, the government's lawyers still worried about the assassination ban and other rules and regulations governing the use of state-sponsored violence. This led to the passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) by Congress just days after 9/11, which has provided the basic legal authorization for counterterrorism strikes ever since.\n\nThe Bush and Obama administrations have used the AUMF and other legal backstops to kill at will, with the killing campaign claiming countless innocent lives, destabilizing nations, and being largely counterproductive. The U.S. has gained public and legal support for targeted killings, but only for what it described as the asymmetric fight against terrorism and non-state actors.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration's drone strike to murder Qassim Suleimani, who was not a \"non-state actor,\" has crossed a clear line. Suleimani was the head of the Quds Force, the elite external operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which operated with impunity throughout Iraq under his leadership. He ran Iran's ground campaign against ISIS in Iraq, in parallel to the American air campaign, and employed Shia militias and their ruthless tactics to defeat the cult-like group.\n\nThe U.S. has taken credit for the victory over ISIS in Iraq without admitting that it relied heavily upon Suleimani's horrific paramilitary actions and his strategic acumen. Suleimani was more than a special forces commander or spymaster; he was Iran's most important envoy and served as Tehran's intimidating political fixer throughout the Middle East.",
    " Title: Trump's Policy Stances Suggest a Shift Away from Traditional Republican Orthodoxy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his bid to secure the support of Republican skeptics, Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for the 2016 presidential election, faces a challenge as his policy positions on several key issues align more with the Democratic party. On matters such as trade and national defense, Trump's policy proposals could potentially place him to the left of Hillary Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent.\n\nTrump, who is often considered a classic Republican, criticizes environmental and corporate regulations, advocates for lower tax rates, and maintains a firm stance on opposing abortion rights. However, the billionaire businessman does not fit neatly into a traditional ideological box.\n\n\"I think I'm running on common sense,\" Trump said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"I think I'm running on what's right. I don't think in terms of labels.\"\n\nOne of Trump's most significant departures from Republican orthodoxy is on trade. While the party's 2012 platform considered trade \"crucial for our economy\" and a means to create more American jobs, Trump has vowed to renegotiate or abandon existing trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the pending Asia-Pacific pact.\n\nTrump's stance on Social Security also sets him apart from the Republican Party. He has stated that he has no plans to scale back Social Security benefits or raise the qualifying retirement age, aligning with Clinton's position.\n\nTrump's tax plan, released last fall, called for lowering the tax rate for the wealthiest Americans from 39.6% to 25% and reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%. The plan, which was met with criticism from outside experts for disproportionately benefiting the rich and increasing the federal deficit, appears to be evolving as Trump now suggests that his plan was merely a starting point for negotiations and that he would like to see the middle class benefit more from any tax law changes.\n\nTrump's policy positions on the minimum wage are also inconsistent. While he has stated that wages are too high and does not support a federal minimum wage, he has also acknowledged the difficulty of surviving on the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour and expressed openness to revisiting the issue.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump has sought to portray Clinton as a hawk who would lead the country into conflict too easily, while his own \"America First\" approach appears to lean more toward isolationism. Clinton, on the other hand, advocates for a combination of diplomatic, legal, economic, political, and cultural tools to expand American influence, and believes the U.S. must be an active participant on the world stage, particularly as part of international alliances such as NATO. Trump has criticized NATO, questioning the structure that sees the U.S. pay for most of its costs.\n\nTrump's policy positions, which have been described as contradictory at times, have been met with criticism from both sides of the political aisle. However, Trump has maintained that his proposals are open to negotiation and subject to change, particularly if they benefit the middle class more.",
    " Title: St. Louis Couple Surrenders Rifle to Police After Confrontation with Protesters\n\nArticle:\n\nA husband and wife in St. Louis, who gained national attention after brandishing firearms at protesters outside their home, have surrendered a rifle to police following a search warrant execution. The incident occurred on Friday, as authorities investigated the June 28 confrontation between the couple and a group protesting police brutality and the city's mayor's actions.\n\nThe couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, were caught on video armed with a rifle and a handgun as they confronted the protesters in their affluent St. Louis neighborhood of Central West End. Images and videos of the incident circulated on social media during the Black Lives Matter protests that took place across the country following the death of George Floyd.\n\nIn a video of the incident, Mark McCloskey is heard yelling, \"Get the hell out of my neighborhood. Private property. Get out.\"\n\nThe St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department stated in a Saturday statement that detectives executed a search warrant at the McCloskey residence, seizing a Colt, semi-automatic,.223 caliber rifle. Attorney Joel Schwartz, who now represents the McCloskeys, stated that the couple voluntarily surrendered the rifle and that a second weapon was turned over to the previous lawyer.\n\nSchwartz maintained the McCloskeys' innocence, stating they are \"law-abiding citizens that were well within their rights.\" The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office said the matter remains under investigation.\n\nIn a June statement, police described the McCloskeys as \"victims\" of trespassing and fourth-degree assault. The McCloskeys stated they were on their property when they heard a commotion coming from the street. When they went to investigate, they observed a large group of subjects forcefully breaking an iron gate marked with \"No Trespassing\" and \"Private Street\" signs.\n\nDemonstrators were in the neighborhood to protest against police brutality and Mayor Lyda Krewson, a Central West End resident who had released the names and addresses of activists who want to defund the police. Krewson has since apologized.\n\nFreelance photojournalist Daniel Shular, who was at the protest, previously told NBC News that he did not see anyone break the gate leading to the neighborhood and recalled seeing people simply walk through an open gate. Shular also stated that he saw at least one armed protester but said it's \"not super out of the ordinary for the protests here.\"\n\nAttorney Albert Watkins, the previous attorney for the McCloskeys, said last month that his clients are supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement and became fearful because white protesters were acting aggressively.",
    " Title: Univision's Coverage of President Trump's Mount Rushmore Speech Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nUnivision, a broadcast network known for its advocacy on immigration issues, has come under criticism for its coverage of President Donald Trump's Independence Day eve address at Mount Rushmore. The Trump campaign compared Univision's coverage to that of MSNBC's Spanish-language counterpart, Telemundo, while the network itself has been likened to a hybrid of TeleSur and Al-Jazeera, owned by the National Council of La Raza.\n\nIn its coverage, Univision portrayed Trump's Rushmore speech as a \"campaign rally and 4th of July celebration\" during a full-blown pandemic, where social distancing and mask-wearing were not strictly enforced. The network also highlighted the controversial nature of the speech, suggesting that instead of uniting the nation during a time of crisis, Trump's speech further divided it.\n\nThe network's report omitted significant portions of Trump's speech, including his mentions of Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Jefferson, as well as his proposed National Garden, and his denunciations of the radical left's attempts to erase history. This omission allowed Univision to frame Trump's speech primarily in terms of COVID-19 and Confederate monuments, aligning with the network's narrative.\n\nFollowing the speech, Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) dismissed Trump as spending all his time \"talking about dead traitors.\" This reaction makes sense if one assumes that Duckworth was only exposed to Univision's report, which did not mention the movement to erase American history or the violent mobs that have vandalized statues of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Frederick Douglass.\n\nIn a subsequent incident, Tucker Carlson criticized Duckworth for her willingness to have a \"conversation\" on the erasure of George Washington, a slave owner, in the midst of the debate over symbols and racism. Univision's response to this criticism is telling, as it did not address the broader effort to cancel America's Founding or the violent mobs that have sought to vandalize American historical symbols. Instead, Univision appears to focus on the side of the monument debate that aligns with its interests.",
    " Title: Investing in Ethical Corporations Proves Profitable During COVID-19 Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, a new \"we are all in this together\" ethic is emerging, as people adopt codes of behavior that emphasize neighborliness, social distancing, and community support. This shift in behavior is not limited to personal conduct but is also being observed in the business world, where the focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics is increasing.\n\nESG is a code of behavior in the business world that prioritizes long-term sustainability over short-term profits, addressing issues like climate change and inequality rather than focusing on the next quarterly report. During the coronavirus crisis, for instance, many workers are being furloughed instead of fired, and companies are donating equipment or finding other ways to help their communities. Some corporations are also suspending dividends to shareholders or postponing executive bonuses.\n\nRecent research by Bloomberg Intelligence and RBC Capital Markets indicates that investors who have bought stocks in companies with strong ESG performance are outperforming other broad indexes this year. Moreover, money continues to flow into ESG mutual funds, according to Bank of America. In other words, as the global economy ebbs during the pandemic, ethical corporate practices are proving to be financially advantageous.\n\nLooking ahead to the post-COVID-19 world, the British bank Barclays estimates that the use of ESG by investors may accelerate. Investors view the crisis as a prelude to potential economic hits in the future, such as climate change, and are looking to corporations to contribute to our collective resiliency.\n\nDespite the current investor panic, many now see an upside to ethical values in companies over bottom-line profits. The virus crisis is serving as a catalyst for the adoption of more codes of behavior in capitalism.",

Kennedy highlighted the House of Representatives' passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and the broader economy.\n\nKennedy stated that the president has prioritized American families and workers since day one, and this focus has been reflected in the economy and trade agreements such as the USMCA. He emphasized that the economy has been particularly beneficial for people without college degrees and those from military backgrounds, who have seen some of the largest gains.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, blue-collar workers have yielded the largest economic benefits across Trump's presidential tenure, with non-supervisory manufacturing positions experiencing the highest wage gains. The USMCA, Kennedy explained, puts in place tougher labor standards for manufacturing, which will discourage factories from moving to Mexico or leaving the country. Instead, these provisions create a strong incentive for manufacturers to stay in the U.S.\n\nKennedy also noted that manufacturing is experiencing a resurgence in the U.S., after many had assumed it would never recover. He believes the USMCA will solidify and accelerate this growth.\n\nRegarding the impeachment push by Democrats, Kennedy estimated that Republicans are unified in their opposition and expects this unity to continue in the Senate. When asked about the possibility of a bipartisan vote against convicting the president, Kennedy responded that it is more likely that there will be a bipartisan opposition to convicting the president and a partisan vote in favor of him, as Republicans have been incredibly unified on this issue, while Democrats are reportedly divided and fractured.\n\n\"\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday\" broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern (4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Pacific).",
    " Title: Tacoma Proposes Gun Sales Tax, Sparking Debate Over Local Firearm Regulation\n\nArticle:\n\nTacoma, Washington, is considering a proposal to levy a high tax on gun sales, potentially making it one of a handful of U.S. cities to implement such a measure. This move opens a new front in the ongoing debate over the extent to which local governments can regulate firearms.\n\nUnder current Washington state law, cities and towns are prohibited from enacting their own gun laws. However, the proposed tax in Tacoma, which would collect $25 per gun sale to fund violence prevention programs, is modeled on a law in neighboring Seattle that has been upheld by the state supreme court.\n\nRyan Mello, the Tacoma city councilman behind the measure, stated, \"I can't ban assault rifles in the city of Tacoma. I can't ban certain types of ammo in the city of Tacoma. I can't require safe storage. There's a lot I can't do, but the one thing I am not pre-empted from doing is reasonable taxation on firearms and ammunition.\"\n\nOpponents of the proposal, which would also collect taxes on ammunition, argue it could drive gun shops out of the industrial port city of 215,000 residents. In Seattle, lawmakers projected $300,000 to $500,000 a year in gun taxes, but last year received only $77,642 due to gun stores relocating.\n\nDan Davies, owner of Mary's Pistols in Tacoma, expressed concern, stating, \"It'll put us out of business; there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.\"\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms-industry trade association, and other pro-gun groups are opposing the Tacoma tax, which is set for a city council vote on Tuesday. Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of government relations and public affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, expressed concern that other cities might follow Tacoma's lead.\n\nAero Precision, a gun parts manufacturer that employs around 400 people in Tacoma, issued a statement last week opposing the tax and stating it may explore other options if the tax is implemented. Gun store owner Sergey Solyanik moved his business from Seattle to Lynnwood due to the tax, stating, \"It's not really possible to run a store with this tax.\"\n\nCouncilman Mello anticipates the tax will generate between $30,000 and $40,000 annually for violence prevention programs while making gun purchases less appealing.\n\nIn the past four decades, many states have passed so-called gun pre-emption laws, which limit local authorities' ability to regulate guns. The National Rifle Association has been a significant advocate for these laws, arguing they help gun owners avoid a patchwork of laws. Cities across the country have attempted to circumvent these prohibitions with limited success.\n\nIn 2018, Pittsburgh passed restrictions on semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 model used in a synagogue mass shooting in that city. The law was immediately challenged in court with the backing of the NRA and is currently on hold.\n\nLast week, a Washington state judge ruled that Edmonds, a municipality north of Seattle, cannot enforce a new city law requiring gun owners to keep their guns locked up at home. The decision came in response to a legal challenge from the NRA and the Second Amendment Foundation, which is based in Washington state.\n\nCook County in Illinois, home to Chicago, passed a gun tax in 2013, and Seattle followed in 2015. Tim Burgess, a former Seattle city council member, introduced the tax as a means to fund a gun violence research and prevention program at a local hospital, Harborview Medical Center. Burgess stated, \"Let's tax the firearms industry because it's their product that's causing this harm.\"\n\nIn 2017, the state supreme court ruled in favor of Seattle and against the NRA, the NSSF, and the Second Amendment Foundation, determining that the tax's primary purpose is not to regulate firearms but \"to raise revenue for the public benefit.\"",
    " Title: GOP Lawmakers Remain Silent on Trump's Call for Foreign Interference in Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the release of a rough transcript of a call in which President Donald Trump urged Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens, a notable silence from Republican lawmakers has been observed on television. Since September 25, none of the 53 Republican senators have appeared on MSNBC, though invitations have been extended to them. Similarly, just four of 197 Republican House members have appeared on MSNBC, with one of them not running for reelection.\n\nSeven Republican House members have appeared on CNN during this time period, but no senators have done so. CNN anchor Jim Sciutto reported on Friday that more than 60 Republican members of the House and Senate did not respond when asked whether Trump went too far in publicly asking China to investigate a political rival.\n\nThe silence of Republican lawmakers has become a story in itself after two weeks of revelations, including explosive text messages among diplomats and Trump's shocking call on the White House lawn for China to investigate the Bidens. CNN displayed the names of several Republican lawmakers who have remained silent in a graphic titled \"GOP Lawmakers Silent On Trump's Call For China To Dig Up Biden Dirt.\"\n\nOne of the lawmakers on the list, Sen. Ron Johnson, appeared two days later on \"Meet the Press\" in a contentious interview that quickly went viral. Host Chuck Todd became visibly exasperated with Johnson after the senator deflected the host's question about comments he made to The Wall Street Journal about Ukraine to talk about emails by former FBI agent Peter Strzok, a recurring character in the conservative media narrative of a \"deep state\" out to get Trump.\n\nThe tense exchange between Todd and Johnson, filled with cross talk, \"didn't make for enjoyable television or helpful civil discourse,\" Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote. However, \"it was the right thing for Todd to do,\" she added.\n\nAnother GOP senator, Roy Blunt of Missouri, visited CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, where host Margaret Brennan asked if it were \"appropriate to ask for a foreign government to interfere in the election.\" Blunt suggested the president was joking when he called on China to investigate the Bidens, a response stalwart Trump defender Rep. Jim Jordan echoed on ABC's \"This Week\" while evading questions from host George Stephanopoulos.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have successfully dodged questions in the past about Trump's conduct, such as an outrageous tweet or offensive remark. Several Republicans told reporters upon leaving Washington on September 26 that they hadn't read the whistleblower complaint, even though it was published online hours earlier and dominated news coverage.\n\nThe silence of Republican lawmakers has been met with criticism from some quarters. Sen. Mitt Romney was targeted by Trump for tweeting that Trump's \"brazen and unprecedented\" calls for foreign nations to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter are \"wrong and appalling.\" Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd, who has already announced he's not running for reelection, is one of the few Republicans who have spoken out, calling the exchanges between U.S. diplomats over efforts for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens \"damning.\"\n\nAccording to data provided by progressive watchdog Media Matters, Hurd is one of 19 House Republicans who have appeared on Fox News during weekdays from 6 a.m. to midnight since September 25. A few Republican senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have also appeared during that time period.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham expressed criticism of Trump on Monday on \"Fox & Friends,\" though it was over his decision to pull troops out of Syria and abandon U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters. Some other Republican lawmakers have criticized the Syria decision, while also blasting the NBA for apologizing to China after the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support on Twitter for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper noted lawmakers \"rightly condemning the NBA for kowtowing to China\" amid the comparative silence around foreign intervention in domestic politics. \"The idea of China interfering in the sanctity of the NBA is somehow incredibly offensive to them,\" he said, \"whereas the same standard for American elections results in the sound of crickets.\"",

The event, which took place on the popular social media and forum site, saw a surge in traffic that temporarily caused the site to go down.\n\nThe AMA session began at approximately 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and within moments, the president received hundreds of questions. The president's responses can be found here. At certain points, the site experienced downtime, returning an error message when users attempted to update or log on. The authenticity of the president's participation was confirmed by the Obama campaign with a photograph of him at his computer and a tweet.\n\nDuring the session, the president addressed topics such as internet freedom, the space program, the most challenging decision of his first term (the surge in Afghanistan), and the White House beer (\"it's tasty\"). Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, in a quick email to \u2588\u2588\u2588, expressed his excitement, stating, \"I'm thrilled, obviously, but what makes this even more exciting is that President Obama is doing this AMA from Charlottesville, VA - the same place where 7 years ago, Steve Huffman and I started the company that'd create Reddit. (We were undergrads at UVA).\"\n\nReddit and Ohanian have also launched an \"Internet 2012?\" bus tour. The bus will travel from Denver to Danville, Kentucky, where organizers will speak with Americans, including students and startup founders, about their internet usage and legislation surrounding it.\n\nAfter an hour, Obama had amassed hundreds of comments and questions on Reddit. The site remained operational for some users during the event. The president's closing comment was, \"If you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!\"",

ET in Charleston, South Carolina. The debate will feature seven candidates in the main event, which can be watched live at 9 pm ET. The debate's venue, the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center, is less than 10 miles from the Emanuel AME Church, the site of a mass shooting last June.\n\nGun control and the global economy are expected to be discussed during the debate, with President Obama bringing up gun control in his State of the Union Address and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley revisiting the incident in her Republican response. The debate's location also provides a tie-in for questions about the global economy, as Charleston is a thriving hub of maritime commerce.\n\nThe debate's format may differ from previous Republican debates, as there are only seven candidates in the main event, which could result in a more focused and less chaotic discussion. The debate's moderators will be Neil Cavuto, Maria Bartiromo, and Gerard Baker of the FOX Business Network.\n\nSeveral key issues are expected to be discussed during the debate, including the situation on Farsi island, the President's emphasis on guns and not domestic terrorism, his use of the term \"Muslim\" in relation to hate crimes, and his assertion that America's global influence is not in decline.\n\nThe debate's format will likely include questions about the Canadian birth of Ted Cruz, the Goldman Sachs undisclosed million-dollar loan, and the candidates' positions on gun control, the economy, and foreign policy. The debate will also provide an opportunity for the candidates to appeal to the conservative South Carolina electorate and to distinguish themselves from their competitors.\n\nIn the spirit of Charleston's Low Country, the debate will likely be a lively and engaging event, with the candidates vying for the support of the Republican primary voters in South Carolina and across the nation. The debate will be an important milestone in the 2016 presidential race, as the candidates continue to make their case to the American people.",
    " Title: Defense Cuts Threaten Political Consequences for Lawmakers in Defense-Heavy Districts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe impending automatic spending cuts, known as the sequester, early next year, particularly from the Pentagon, could not only impact the economy but also pose a political challenge for lawmakers from defense-heavy districts. The $1.2 trillion in defense and domestic spending cuts could lead to an election loss, according to some analysts.\n\nFrom the Navy shipyards of Norfolk to the aerospace industry hangars in Southern California, and in the corporate towers of defense contractors within the Beltway, the sequester is not just an urgent policy matter but a potential political liability for lawmakers. Republicans, who aim to abolish the sequester and safeguard the Pentagon, are already targeting Democrats, who insist that new tax revenues must be part of any deal to roll back military cuts.\n\nRep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), a veteran of the first Gulf War and the Iraq War, stated, \"Any member of Congress that would defend the sequester and not come up with an alternative or [insist on revenues], I think that in a competitive district, that they would be open to attack, to cutting defense too deeply.\"\n\nA study showed that deep defense cuts could cost 1 million jobs nationwide, with significant impacts in California, Virginia, and Florida. In the tossup race between Democratic Rep. Mark Critz and Republican Keith Rothfus in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, Rothfus has criticized Critz for rejecting GOP proposals to shield Pentagon cuts, despite both parties having issues with the package of cuts, which affects domestic safety net programs.\n\nThe looming sequester leaves Democrats in a difficult position, as they must balance honoring last year's debt limit deal, which enacted the defense cuts trigger, and protecting jobs in their home district. The projected military cuts have made for easy targeting by Republican operatives, who are trying to portray some Democrats as willing to eliminate stable defense-oriented jobs.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee has criticized Democratic lawmakers like Reps. Larry Kissell of North Carolina, Bill Owens of New York, and John Barrow of Georgia for rejecting plans to save cuts from hitting Forts Bragg, Drum, and Gordon. Paul Lindsay, an NRCC spokesman, stated, \"These Democrats are already on record opposing common-sense reforms that would avoid these devastating cuts to local jobs and America's military.\"\n\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) agrees with Republicans on at least this point: that these cuts would be catastrophic.",
    " Title: FDA Approves Emergency Use of Ebola Blood Testing Kit; Survival Rates in Sierra Leone Reach 70%\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency approval for a new diagnostic kit to test blood for the Ebola virus. This move comes as doctors in one hard-hit area, Sierra Leone, report a survival rate of approximately 70%.\n\nThe FDA announced the approval on its website on Tuesday, following a series of emergency authorizations since October. The emergency authorizations were issued after the federal government declared that the ongoing health crisis necessitated the use of testing methods that have not undergone the standard regulatory approval process.\n\nThe blood-testing kits are part of an effort to be proactive in handling the disease. The FDA's seventh emergency authorization since October was granted based on a 2006 determination by then-Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff that the Ebola virus poses a material threat to the United States population, sufficient to affect national security.\n\nThe United States has seen four confirmed cases of the virus so far: three healthcare workers and one man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died in Texas after contracting the virus in Liberia. On Wednesday, Liberia's U.N. peacekeeping mission reported its fourth Ebola case. A U.N. spokesman stated in a statement that the infected worker was from Liberia and was transferred to an Ebola treatment unit.\n\nDoctors in Sierra Leone are reporting signs of improvement, with survival rates increasing. According to a letter written by several doctors and published online by the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, about 70% of Ebola patients are surviving the virus despite the absence of a vaccine. The doctors describe 581 cases they dealt with at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, in late September. About 31% of the patients died, including 38 people who were dead upon arrival. However, even these numbers appear to be improving. Among patients admitted since November 5, the mortality rate was less than 24%.\n\nThe figures compare to a 74% death rate for 106 patients who were treated in the eastern Sierra Leone town of Kenema in May and June, when some health workers were on strike and the response to the outbreak was in crisis mode. The spread of the outbreak has slowed significantly, according to the CDC, which gave a worst-case scenario estimate of as many as 1.4 million cases by mid-January if the region did not receive more aid. Last month, the agency stated that prediction would not happen.\n\n\"There's been real momentum and real progress,\" CDC Director Thomas Frieden said Monday after his second trip to Ebola-stricken countries. \"The challenge is not to let up.\"\n\nThis article is based in part on wire service reports.",
    " Title: Conservative Republicans Challenge Boehner's Government Funding Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of conservative Republicans, often referred to as the \"Hell No\" caucus, is causing problems for the Republican leadership in Congress once again. The group will meet Wednesday at the Capitol Hill Club to discuss lame-duck legislation, with Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who often serves as a de facto spokesman for congressional hardliners, expected to attend.\n\nThese conservative lawmakers are expressing their dissatisfaction with the plan outlined by Speaker John Boehner during a closed-door meeting Tuesday, which involves a spending bill that keeps the government funded through September with a chance to review the Department of Homeland Security's funding in March. Instead, they want to pass a much shorter resolution.\n\nRep. John Fleming (R-La.) stated, \"I'm not sure it's going to pass the way they are proposing it. I think it's likely they are going to have to improve it if they want it to pass.\" Conservative Republicans estimate the number of Republican \"no\" votes to be near 30 to 40, which could derail a vote on the government funding bill if Democrats oppose the measure.\n\nSenate conservatives are also criticizing the House GOP leadership's plan to fund the government and symbolically disapprove of the president's immigration action. Senators Jeff Sessions of Alabama, David Vitter of Louisiana, and Mike Lee of Utah have begun to blast the House GOP leadership's plan, arguing that the House needs to block funding for the implementation of Obama's executive action now, not later.\n\nSenator Mike Lee laid out a detailed roadmap to taking on the executive action in a statement to Breitbart News, arguing for a short-term continuing resolution that blocks funding for the executive action. \"The House needs to do the right thing and send over the short-term bill with the defund language,\" said Lee spokesman Brian Phillips.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) gave a tepid endorsement of the House leadership's plan on Tuesday, while Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has largely deferred to the House, declining to say what they should do and emphasizing that there will be no shutdown.\n\nConservative Republicans are beginning to converge around the idea of a shorter-term CR that strictly limits funds to the Department of Homeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing Obama's immigration executive actions. Representative Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) stated, \"I'm probably leaning no [on the current House plan].\"\n\nThe atmosphere could be better for Republicans in January, as the Senate will then be controlled by the GOP, increasing the likelihood that any long-term spending legislation passed in the House could be put to a vote in the Senate. Plans floated by conservatives include passing a CR that keeps the government open just until the first week of the next Congress in January.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a leading conservative in the House, stated on Tuesday that \"the cavalry is coming\" and that he preferred to deal with the larger funding issues next year. Outspoken Representative Tim Huelskamp, who has built a reputation around opposing Republican leadership, also backed a proposal that would only temporarily extend government funding.\n\n\"For me, it's generally in appropriations the shorter the better,\" the Kansas Republican said.",
    " Title: Election 2018: Senate and House Outcomes Hinge on Modest Turnout Shifts\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Election Day approaches, expectations for the Senate and House of Representatives remain largely unchanged from the past six months. In the Senate, Republicans are more likely to gain seats than lose the majority, while in the House, Democrats are favored to win control but may not experience a significant \"blue wave.\"\n\nThe general expectations are influenced by geography and historical trends. Republicans are expected to perform well in the Senate due to Democrats defending numerous seats in states that traditionally lean Republican. Conversely, Democrats are expected to perform well in the House because the party out of power usually gains ground in midterm elections.\n\nHowever, the potential for a wide range of outcomes exists due to the close nature of many races. As of Wednesday, there are six highly competitive Senate races, with five of them being pure toss-ups (Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada). Montana is slightly leaning towards the Democrats as Jon Tester attempts to hold on in a Republican-leaning state.\n\nScottRasmussen.com has conducted private research for the Auto Alliance and the National Retail Federation on all six of these races. In each case, three different turnout models have been examined, resulting in a range of possible outcomes. If Republican turnout is slightly higher than expected, the GOP could win all six competitive races. Conversely, if Democratic turnout is slightly higher than expected, the Democrats could sweep all six races.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, the Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to win control. ScottRasmussen.com currently projects that Democrats are poised to pick up 12 seats, with 33 seats still too close to call. The Democrats need to win 11 of these 33 races, but the outcome is not guaranteed.\n\nThe Generic Congressional Ballot polling shows Democrats with a 7-point advantage. If they win the popular vote by this margin on Election Day, they would be favored to win most of the 33 competitive races. However, a slight shift in the popular vote could have a significant impact, with the Republicans potentially maintaining their majority if they boost turnout and narrow the gap, or the Democrats potentially enjoying a large victory if they shift the popular vote in their favor.\n\nIn conclusion, the final outcome of Election 2018 will be determined by modest changes in voter turnout. The elections will be closely contested, and small shifts in voter behavior could lead to significant changes in the balance of power in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.",
    " Title: Twitter Does Not Violate Policies by Allowing Chinese Officials to Spread Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories\n\nArticle:\n\nChinese state officials spreading propaganda online, including conspiracy theories suggesting the United States introduced the coronavirus into Wuhan, China, are not violating Twitter's terms of service, according to a company representative. The representative, who spoke to the Daily Beast on condition of anonymity, cited language on Twitter's website stating that direct interactions with public figures, comments on political issues, or foreign policy discussions are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.\n\nThe representative's comments follow a series of tweets by Chinese senior official Lijian Zhao on March 12, in which he suggested the United States was trying to covertly inject the virus into China. Zhao's tweet included false information about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its director, Robert Redfield. Redfield was not arrested, contrary to Zhao's claim.\n\nZhao's tweet is not the only instance of misinformation on the platform. On March 20, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told his followers that children are \"essentially immune\" to coronavirus, a claim that Twitter previously stated was impermissible. However, Twitter appeared to backtrack after Musk's comment, stating that the tweets do not violate its rules at this time.\n\nHealth officials say the virus began in China's Wuhan region and expanded geometrically from there, contradicting Zhao's suggestions otherwise. Twitter has not provided a reason for not going on the record regarding its policies on misinformation.",
    " Title: Delegates' Freedom to Vote Their Conscience at GOP Convention: Interpretation of Party Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nCurly Haugland, a GOP national committeeman from North Dakota, has asserted that the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer could allow delegates to vote according to their personal preferences, rather than being bound by primary results. Haugland, in an interview with Morning Edition on Thursday, argued that primary votes are \"absolutely irrelevant\" come convention time, despite custom dictating that delegates should support primary winners.\n\nHaugland cited the GOP's convention Rules 37 and 38 to support his interpretation, stating that these rules allow delegates to \"vote their conscience.\" However, it is important to note that these rules do not explicitly state this. Rule 37 outlines the procedure for roll call votes, while Rule 38 prohibits the \"unit rule,\" meaning that delegates from a state cannot all be forced to vote the same way.\n\nHaugland's interpretation is not a unanimous view. It is more widely accepted that delegates currently pledged to Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, or others must support them at least on the first ballot. However, if no candidate receives a majority, delegates would necessarily vote differently on later ballots to resolve the impasse.\n\nAnother of Haugland's points is indisputable: \"When the convention convenes,\" he said, \"the delegates adopt their own rules, which have not been adopted yet.\" There is a standard template for conventions, but delegates could potentially alter the template, changing the game in any way they want, as long as their actions are publicly known and open to criticism.\n\nThe latitude afforded to delegates explains why it is considered significant that Senator Ted Cruz has outmaneuvered Trump in several states, ensuring as many delegates as possible are Cruz supporters. Haugland's personal goal is to adopt a rule that assures delegates the chance to choose from a wide range of alternatives, including candidates such as Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio who have suspended their campaigns.",
    " Title: CDC Outlines Ebola Policies for U.S. States; New Jersey and New York Revise Quarantine Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released updated guidelines for states to monitor individuals entering the country from Ebola-affected nations in West Africa. The new policies, announced on Monday, suggest a voluntary 21-day home quarantine for those at the highest risk of Ebola transmission.\n\nThe updated guidelines come after several states, including New York and New Jersey, announced their own mandatory quarantine policies for returning health care workers over the weekend. Many public health officials have criticized these measures, stating they may cause more harm than good.\n\nNew Jersey, in particular, faced scrutiny for quarantining a nurse who had returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. The nurse, who exhibits no symptoms and tested negative for Ebola, will return to her home in Maine on a private flight, avoiding public contact.\n\nThe CDC's new best practices, outlined in a press call on Monday afternoon, are designed for four categories of people who are not showing symptoms. These guidelines cover both international travelers and those who may have had domestic contact with the virus.\n\nIndividuals at the highest risk, such as health care workers who had a needle stick while treating Ebola patients, would be asked to remain under voluntary home quarantine and have direct, in-person checks by a health official daily for 21 days.\n\nHealth care workers returning from Africa would be included in the \"some risk\" category, which includes daily direct monitoring but allows for more freedom of movement, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden did not specifically address the policies in New York or New Jersey, but expressed concern about policies that might increase stigma towards health care workers and give false impressions of Ebola's infectiousness.\n\n\"If we turn them into pariahs instead of recognizing the heroic nature of the work they're doing, then they may be less likely to identify themselves as health workers\u2014and thus go unmonitored\u2014and less likely to go help [Africa] in the first place,\" Frieden said.\n\nFrieden stated that state and local officials have the right to set stricter standards, but that the CDC's guidelines are based on science.\n\nThe quarantined nurse, Kaci Hickox, had retained a civil rights attorney on Sunday and threatened to sue New Jersey for detaining her despite her lack of symptoms and negative Ebola test results. Hickox, who spent a month treating patients in Sierra Leone with Doctors Without Borders, had emerged as the face of many public health experts' opposition to the mandatory 21-day quarantines announced on Friday night in New York and New Jersey.\n\nOn Monday, Virginia also announced enhanced plans to monitor individuals entering the country from the affected part of West Africa. Some considered at high risk will face a home quarantine with daily check-ins by health officials.\n\nThe CDC announced last week that all individuals entering the United States from the West African countries will have to provide detailed contact information, monitor their temperature twice daily, and report the results to local health officials daily. This policy began in six states on Monday and will be expanded nationwide.",

The escalating situation has led to police presence at the school, and students are reportedly fearful of attending classes the following day.\n\nBoth Schroder and Hillmann claimed they had been doxxed, with their identities and contact information made public online. Hillmann stated that he, despite not being present during the incident, had been doxxed on three separate occasions, leading to a wave of hateful messages and threats. Schroder added that many parents' identities were also exposed, potentially affecting their jobs and employment status.\n\nSchroder and Hillmann attributed the media for the escalation of the situation, with Schroder stating that several outlets \"blatantly lied\" about the encounter and that the coverage had a significant impact on their community.\n\nNick Sandmann, the classmate featured in the viral clip, was wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and appeared to be smirking at a Native American elder, Nathan Phillips, who was beating a drum during a D.C. protest. In a statement released on Sunday, Sandmann claimed he was attempting to \"diffuse\" the situation by smiling and that Phillips had \"singled [him] out for a confrontation.\"\n\nPhillips, on the other hand, claimed he saw \"hatred\" in the eyes of the \"beastly young men\" who surrounded Sandmann and cheered him on during the encounter.",
    " Title: AI Adjustments in Response to the Global Pandemic: A Closer Look at Amazon, Phrasee, and Featurespace\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing global crisis has highlighted the need for AI systems to be trained not just on recent events, but also on historical anomalies such as the Great Depression, the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, and the 2007-2008 financial crisis. According to AI expert Sharma, this crisis serves as a trigger to build better machine-learning models.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to prepare for every eventuality. David Excell, founder of Featurespace, a behavior analytics company, notes that if a machine-learning system doesn't see what it expects to see, problems will arise. Despite this, Featurespace's AI has not been significantly impacted, as people continue to buy everyday items, but not high-ticket or new items, which could raise suspicions.\n\nAnother AI company, Phrasee, uses natural-language processing and machine learning to generate email marketing copy and Facebook ads. During the pandemic, Phrasee has had to filter out additional language and ban specific phrases, such as \"going viral,\" and terms that may stoke anxiety, such as \"brace yourself.\"\n\nAmazon, a microcosm for the retail industry as a whole, has made subtle behind-the-scenes adjustments to meet demand. To ease demand on its own warehouses, its algorithms now appear more likely to promote third-party sellers that handle their own deliveries. This adjustment would be hard to do without manual intervention, as the situation is so volatile.\n\nThe tweaks Amazon makes to its algorithms have knock-on effects on the algorithms that sellers use to decide what to spend on online advertising. One of the best predictors of whether someone who clicks an ad will buy a product is how long it will take to deliver, so Nozzle is talking to customers about adjusting their algorithms to take this into account.\n\nThe current situation has shown that a dedicated team is necessary to keep tabs on AI systems, as they would not pick up on some of the subtleties of the crisis. As we move forward, it is essential to take stock of these newly exposed systems and ask how they might be designed better, made more resilient, and more closely monitored.",
    " Title: Migrant Caravan Approaches U.S.-Mexico Border, Threatening to Enter U.S. Space\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of approximately 150 migrants, carrying white flags bearing the phrase \"La paz y Dios,\" or \"Peace and God are With Us,\" have separated from a larger caravan and are currently within 500 feet of the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a report by The San Diego Union-Tribune on Thursday. The migrants are reportedly seeking asylum and are displaying the white flags to demonstrate their peaceful intentions.\n\nMexican federal police have set up a barrier near a pedestrian crossing and urged the migrants to apply for jobs in Tijuana, claiming there are thousands of job opportunities in the city. Federal police, dressed in riot gear, have prevented the caravan from getting closer to the U.S. border.\n\nCarlos Lopez, a Honduran leading the smaller group, told The San Diego Union-Tribune that the conditions in Mexico are poor, with sick children and women being forced to remain outside in the elements. Those already in the city have resorted to camping in tents, sleeping on dirt fields, or under bleachers, or staying in overcrowded shelters as they wait to determine their next steps.\n\n\"The whole world is watching what is happening here,\" Lopez said.\n\nThe larger caravan, containing about 6,219 Central Americans, is currently in Mexico. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks or months. President Trump has labeled the caravan a national security threat and has stated that it will not enter the U.S.\n\nOn Monday, a judge barred President Trump from enforcing a ban on asylum for those who cross the U.S. border illegally, a decision the administration said would lead to \"countless illegal aliens pouring into our country.\"\n\nThe migrants who have traveled for over a month can now see a bridge that separates them from the U.S.\n\nSpeaking to reporters while in Florida for the holiday, Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border for an undisclosed period of time if his administration determines that Mexico has lost \"control\" on its side. Trump also stated that he has given the thousands of active-duty troops he sent to the border before the Nov. 6 midterm elections the \"OK\" to use lethal force against migrants \"if they have to.\" He also expressed support for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whom he has criticized for not being tough enough on immigration, stating that she is \"in there trying.\"",
    " Title: \"The Redeeming Power of Christmas: The Life of John Newton, Author of 'Amazing Grace'\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe silence that descends on malls and Main Streets during the holiday season serves as a stark contrast to the bustling activity of previous years. However, the Christmas message, born 2,000 years ago in a manger, continues to resonate, transforming lives and offering redemption. This transformation is vividly illustrated in the life of John Newton, an English slaver who was born 300 years ago.\n\nBorn in Liverpool to a seafaring family, Newton's mother, a godly woman, instilled in him a sense of faith that remained with him throughout his life. After his mother's death when he was seven, Newton's father remarried, and he left school at 11 to join his father at sea. His life took a darker turn as he adopted the vulgar lifestyle of seafaring men, but the memory of his mother's faith remained.\n\nNewton was eventually seized by a press gang and forced to work on HMS Harwich, where life grew coarser. He ran away, was captured, and subjected to brutal treatment, including flogging without mercy. The Harwich then traded him to a slaving ship bound for West Africa to take on human cargo.\n\nIn Africa, Newton's life took a turn for the worse. He was left in the care of a cruel African princess, who grew jealous of her husband's friendship with Newton. She blinded him, left him in a pigsty to die, and mocked him as he lay delirious. Miraculously, Newton survived, and was eventually rescued and returned to HMS Harwich.\n\nNewton's life continued to be marked by adversity, and he became a magnet for misfortune. He was treated harshly on the ship, allowed to eat only the entrails of animals. After five years, his captain returned, and Newton recounted his ordeal, only to be mocked as a liar.\n\nIt was during this time that Newton, the wanton sinner and arrogant blasphemer, was driven to his knees. He cried out to God, and miraculously, he was rescued and returned to London. There, he fell under the preaching of George Whitefield and the influence of John Wesley, and was born again into a new life in Christ.\n\nShortly before Christmas Day of 1807, Newton died at the age of 82, leaving a powerful testimony to the miracle born on the first Christmas. His life and experiences were set to music, and the hymn he authored, 'Amazing Grace,' became one of the most beloved hymns of Christendom.\n\n\"I commit my soul to my gracious God and Savior, who mercifully spared and preserved me, when I was an apostate, a blasphemer and an infidel, and delivered me from that state on the coast of Africa into which my obstinate wickedness had plunged me,\" Newton wrote in his final days. His life serves as a testament to the power of the Christmas message to redeem and transform even the most wicked of hearts.",

In a tweet on Saturday, Scaramucci stated, \"Full transparency: I'm deleting old tweets. Past views evolved and shouldn't be a distraction. I serve @POTUS agenda and that's all that matters.\"\n\nScaramucci has not disclosed which specific tweets will be removed. However, tweets from 2012, where he advocated for \"common sense\" gun laws and complimented Hillary Clinton, Trump's former campaign rival, were among the posts that were no longer available within hours of his announcement.\n\nOn August 6, 2012, Scaramucci tweeted, \"We (the USA) has 5% of the world's population but 50% of the world's guns. Enough is enough. It is just common sense it apply more controls.\" In another tweet from four months earlier, he said, \"I hope she runs, she is incredibly competent.\" This was roughly three years before Trump entered the 2016 race and formally challenged Clinton, the Democratic party's presumptive nominee.\n\nIn another tweet from March 11, 2016, Scaramucci stated, \"It's possible to combat climate change without crippling the economy. The fact many people still believe [climate change] is a hoax is disheartening.\" This tweet, too, has since been deleted.\n\nScaramucci was named White House Communications Director on Friday, filling a role that has been vacant since Mike Dubke's departure in May. Former spokesman Sean Spicer resigned moments later, stating he was doing so \"to give the President and the new team a clean slate.\"\n\nScaramucci has criticized Trump in the past, but he acknowledged on Friday that the president was aware of his earlier remarks. \"One of the biggest mistakes I made, because I was an inexperienced person in the world of politics. I was supporting another candidate. I should have never said that about him,\" Scaramucci said of his previous comments. \"I love the president and I'm very, very loyal to the president. And I love the mission that the president has,\" he added.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.",

In a YouTube video, Moore compared those protesting such directives to civil rights icon Rosa Parks.\n\nMoore stated that he was working on a \"drive-in\" protest in Wisconsin, with plans to gather at the state capitol. He described the protesters as \"the modern-day Rosa Parks,\" fighting against injustice and a loss of liberties.\n\nThese comments drew criticism from some on social media, with Democratic congressional candidate Scott Huffman stating, \"Could you have imagined the outcome if Rosa brought a gun to the bus?\" Conservative commentator Bill Kristol called the remark \"at once strikingly stupid and deeply offensive.\"\n\nDuring an interview on CBS News, Moore maintained that the Trump administration has waited too long to reopen the economy. He suggested that the economy should have started reopening a week or two ago, expressing concern over the hardship caused to citizens and businesses due to the stay-at-home orders.\n\nProtests against stay-at-home orders have taken place in several states this week, with plans for a \"Freedom Rally\" in Wisconsin on April 24 following the governor's extension of the state's stay-at-home order. Moore noted in the YouTube video that an unnamed donor had pledged to cover bail and legal fees for anyone arrested during the rally.\n\nMany health experts and state leaders, such as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, have emphasized the need for more widespread testing before the country can reopen safely. Moore's plan to support the protests comes after President Trump called to \"LIBERATE\" Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia, all states currently under stay-at-home orders with Democratic governors.",

    " Title: Virginia Attorney General Decides Not to Defend State's Same-sex Marriage Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring announced on Thursday that he will not defend Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage when it goes before a federal judge next week. The decision has elicited varying reactions from Virginians.\n\nHerring, who has been in office for less than two weeks, had to act swiftly on the same-sex marriage issue due to a pending lawsuit challenging the ban. He told NPR's MORNING EDITION that he believes the anti-gay marriage law violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nRepublican State Representative Kirk Cox, the majority leader of the Virginia House of Delegates, disagrees with Herring's decision. Cox stated that the attorney general has a constitutional and statutory obligation to enforce and defend the duly adopted laws and constitution of Virginia.\n\nOutside a diner in Crozet, near Charlottesville, Mary Linn expressed her disapproval of Herring's decision, citing religious beliefs. Retiree Stan Gray, on the other hand, expressed ambivalence on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2006, a referendum that banned same-sex marriage was approved by 57% of Virginia's voters. However, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 50% of Virginians surveyed now support allowing gays and lesbians to marry.\n\nDemocratic State Senator Adam Ebbin, the first openly gay member of the Virginia General Assembly, expressed his satisfaction with his state's changing stance on the issue. Ebbin noted that Virginia has a history of both being the birthplace of civil liberties and resisting integration.\n\nHerring's decision not to defend Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage in court comes after several federal judges have overturned similar bans, including in Utah and Oklahoma. Pennsylvania's attorney general also refused to defend that state's ban, a case now making its way through the courts. In all, more than a dozen states have lawsuits challenging laws forbidding same-sex marriage.

    " Title: Federal Government Cyber Attacks Skyrocket, Human Error and Incompetence Cited as Major Factors\n\nArticle:\n\nA review of cyber attacks on federal agencies by CNN has revealed a significant increase in such breaches, with the number of incidents jumping 35 percent in the past three years. The data shows that espionage is happening at a rate never seen before, according to Denise Zheng, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nIn 2013, there were approximately 46,000 cyber incidents involving government agencies, a significant increase from the 34,000 incidents reported in 2010, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. Last year, there were almost 61,000 cyber attacks and security breaches across the entire federal government, according to a recent Obama administration report.\n\nThe data breaches are not limited to sensitive government information. Hackers are also after personal information accessible through government computer systems, similar to the massive data breaches at retail giants Target and Home Depot. Last July, hackers hit the Energy Department and took personally identifiable information from more than 100,000 people, according to a post-mortem report by the department's inspector general. The data included names, dates and places of birth, social security and bank account numbers, and information about their education and disabilities.\n\nThe federal government's information technology is not as secure as it should be, according to Greg Wilshusen, the director of information security issues at the Government Accounting Office, who was one of the 100,000 people whose data was compromised by the attack. The federal government has identified this area as high-risk since 1997, and it remains a longstanding challenge for the federal government to adequately protect its systems.\n\nSometimes the threat comes from simple incompetence. Last year, the IRS mistakenly posted tens of thousands of social security numbers on government websites, according to the nonprofit Public.Resource.org. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration says protecting taxpayer and employee data is the IRS's most pressing challenge.\n\nThe Obama administration report showed that federal government agencies spent $10 billion on information security. However, the biggest culprits, experts say, are human error and a patchwork of different systems. Billions of dollars in security can't stop an employee from clicking a malicious link.\n\n\"There is no patch for a stupid user,\" said Zheng, who once oversaw a government cyber warfare program. Indeed, this year's Obama administration report found that so-called phishing attacks, where users are duped into clicking links that open systems to hackers, are the most widely reported cyber incident.\n\nNow, some experts say, an answer to the Sony hack is crucial. \"We need to have a response whether it's an industry or a government response so that folks understand there is a penalty here,\" Zheng said. \"If they go unpunished, the message that sends is detrimental.\"",

Federal prosecutors announced they will not retry Edwards on the remaining campaign finance charges.\n\nThe decision comes after a federal jury in Greensboro, North Carolina, found Edwards not guilty on one campaign finance charge but was unable to reach a decision on five other counts related to payments made to support his pregnant mistress.\n\nSeveral jurors stated they did not believe the government's central witness, Andrew Young, an aide who idolized Edwards but grew disillusioned with him.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department's Criminal Division issued a statement regarding the decision:\n\n\"We knew that this case \u2013 like all campaign finance cases \u2013 would be challenging. But it is our duty to bring hard cases when we believe that the facts and the law support charging a candidate for high office with a crime. Last month, the government put forward its best case against Mr. Edwards, and I am proud of the skilled and professional way in which our prosecutors from the Criminal Division's Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina conducted this trial. The jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict on five of the six counts of the indictment, however, and we respect their judgment. In the interest of justice, we have decided not to retry Mr. Edwards on those counts.\"\n\nEdwards' lawyers released a statement, which reads in part:\n\n\"While John has repeatedly admitted to his sins, he has also consistently asserted, as we demonstrated at the trial, that he did not violate any campaign law nor even imagined that any campaign laws could apply. We are confident that the outcome of any new trial would have been the same. We are very glad that, after living under this cloud for over three years, John and his family can have their lives back and enjoy the peace they deserve.\"",
    " Title: A Reflection on the Decline of Civility in Politics: A Look at the Past and Present\n\nArticle:\n\nThe passing of George H.W. Bush has sparked a national conversation about the state of politics in America, with some suggesting that his kind and gentle demeanor could mark a return to a more civil political discourse. The country is yearning for a respite from the current state of political discourse, with many expressing a desire for a more civil and respectful approach to politics.\n\nRecently, a panel of Ph.Ds, moderated by a commentator from National Public Radio, discussed the decline in civility and mutual respect in political discourse. The panel attributed the decline to negativity, which makes it difficult for people with differing opinions to engage in meaningful dialogue. Arthur Evans of the National Institute for Civil Discourse noted that negativity often leaves only the extremes to talk about issues, reinforcing the idea that the only way to discuss certain topics is in an extreme manner.\n\nThe panel's discussion brings to mind the contentious political campaigns of the past, such as the 1800 presidential election between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. During this campaign, both candidates engaged in mudslinging, with each side accusing the other of various unsavory traits. The Adams campaign called Jefferson a \"mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father,\" while the Jefferson camp accused Adams of having a \"hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.\"\n\nDespite the mudslinging, Adams and Jefferson were able to reconcile after the election, demonstrating that political rivalries can be set aside in the name of friendship and unity. This is a reminder that civility in politics is a good idea, but that bashing and negativity can sometimes be inevitable due to the high stakes involved in political campaigns.\n\nWesley Pruden, editor in chief emeritus of The Times, writes that the friendship between Adams and Jefferson survived the brawl, just like the friendship between George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton two centuries later. Pruden notes that winning the election is what politics is all about, and that successful politicians understand the rough wisdom of Leo Durocher's famous quote, \"Nice guys finish last.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the passing of George H.W. Bush has sparked a national conversation about the state of politics in America and the desire for a return to a more civil and respectful political discourse. The panel's discussion on the decline in civility and mutual respect in political discourse highlights the challenges of engaging in meaningful dialogue when negativity is prevalent. However, the history of political campaigns shows that political rivalries can be set aside in the name of friendship and unity, demonstrating that civility in politics is a good idea, but that bashing and negativity can sometimes be inevitable due to the high stakes involved in political campaigns.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Apologizes for \"Deplorables\" Comment, Stands by Criticism of Trump's Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, expressed regret on Saturday for her characterization of half of Donald Trump's supporters as \"deplorable\" during a fundraiser in New York on Friday. However, she maintained her criticism of her Republican rival's campaign.\n\nClinton stated that she was \"grossly generalistic\" when she described Trump voters as racist, sexist, and homophobic. \"That's never a good idea,\" she said. \"I regret saying 'half.' That was wrong.\"\n\nDespite this apology, Clinton continued to label many of Mr. Trump's actions as \"deplorable.\" She added, \"I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign.\"\n\nIn a new statement, Clinton criticized Trump for hiring a major advocate of the so-called \"alt-right\" movement to run his campaign and for giving a national platform to hateful views and voices. She also mentioned the controversy surrounding David Duke, a white supremacist, and his support for Trump.\n\nThe Trump campaign responded to Clinton's initial remark, stating that she had revealed \"her true contempt for everyday Americans.\" Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to Mr. Trump, said, \"This was Clinton, as a defender of Washington\u2019s rigged system, telling the American public that she could care less about them.\"\n\nBy Saturday morning, Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, urged Clinton to make amends. Conway took to Twitter to denounce the comment and spar with a Clinton aide. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, responded that not all Trump voters are part of the alt-right, but alt-right leaders support the Republican nominee, and \"their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events.\"\n\nAt her fundraiser, Clinton later clarified that the other \"basket\" of Trump supporters are \"people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they're just desperate for change.\"\n\nClinton previously had not permitted reporters to attend her fundraisers. However, this week, she has interacted more frequently with journalists, and on Friday night, she allowed a small press pool to listen to her 15-minute speech to donors. At the same event, singer Barbra Streisand mocked Mr. Trump, performing a parody of her song \"Send in the Clowns.\"\n\nTrump responded Saturday afternoon with his own counterpunch, saying Clinton \"should be ashamed of herself\" and asking how the former secretary of state could be president \"when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans.\" He also criticized Clinton for making the \"worst mistake of the political season\" and for not owning up to her \"grotesque attack on American voters.\"",
    " Title: Alex Castellanos: Mandatory Budget Cuts and the Threat to National Priorities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the potential mandatory budget cuts set to take effect on March 1, the discourse surrounding the issue has been fraught with dire warnings and emotional appeals. Alex Castellanos, a political analyst, has criticized the inability of Washington D.C. elites to make tough spending decisions, comparing it to holding one's breath until turning blue.\n\nCastellanos argues that Americans have adapted to living with less since the recession, and questions why the government cannot do the same. He contends that both political parties are engaged in a contemptible game, with President Obama being urged to tighten the federal budget.\n\nThe article highlights the seemingly catastrophic consequences of the proposed budget cuts, with the Defense Department, first responders, and the National Park Service all claiming that their operations would be severely impacted. However, Castellanos questions the indispensability of federal funding in preserving nature, pointing out that the Grand Canyon would supposedly cease to exist if the National Park Service lost a few cents of every dollar it receives.\n\nThe article then shifts focus to a conflict of interest, questioning why government agencies would admit to being less vital to the nation. Castellanos suggests that Washington is blackmailing the American people with their own money, and accuses the government of juvenile petulance for threatening to withhold services if it does not receive the budget it desires.\n\nCastellanos points out that the American people have learned to live with less in the past six years, while the federal budget has grown by $1.7 trillion over the past decade. He notes that Washington now has the third-largest concentration of high-income households in the U.S., and surpassed Silicon Valley for the highest average income in the country over a year ago.\n\nThe article also touches on the growing economy in Washington, D.C., and the increasing wealth of its elites, who are now not just Wall Street's, but also enjoy luxurious vacations and high-end dining experiences. The article mentions the past financial dealings of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who, during his tenure at Citigroup, took a nearly $1 million bonus before the company received a taxpayer-funded bailout and invested in a fund headquartered in a Cayman Islands building, which Obama once called \"the largest tax scam in the world.\"\n\nCastellanos suggests that a true leader, a president, would ask the government to tighten its belt by 2% in light of the economic hardships faced by the American people. However, he criticizes President Obama for directing his lieutenants to threaten the people who pay their salaries, and for promising that the sequester deal would result in \"harsh, arbitrary cuts\" that would \"devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research.\"\n\nThe article concludes by questioning the willingness of the American people to tolerate such behavior from their leaders, and calls for a moment of reflection on when tantrums became threats and leaders surrendered the pretense they were serving the people. The article ends with a reference to \"Washington, the Beautiful,\" suggesting a cynical view of the nation's capital and its leaders.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Declares ISIS Guilty of Genocide Against Christians, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry announced today that the terror group ISIS is responsible for committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims. The announcement comes on the same day that a congressional deadline urging the Obama administration to make its own judgement was set to expire.\n\nEarlier this week, the House overwhelmingly approved a resolution 393-0, stating that actions taken by ISIS against these religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria constitute genocide.\n\nIn a statement from the State Department briefing room, Kerry asserted, \"Da'esh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims.\" He used a local moniker to describe ISIS.\n\nThe U.S. military returned to Iraq in August of 2014 to halt the ISIS massacre of the Yazidis, an ancient ethnic minority living in the Sinjar area. This intervention led to an anti-ISIS coalition and the ongoing military effort. ISIS, comprised mostly of Sunni Muslims, has targeted Shia Muslims, a group it labels as disbelievers.\n\nKerry explained, \"One element of genocide is the intent to destroy an ethnic or religious group in whole or in part.\" He added, \"Its entire world view is based on eliminating those who do not subscribe to its perverse ideology.\"\n\nKerry further stated, \"The fact is that Da'esh kills Christians because they are Christians, the Yazidis because they are Yazidis, [and] Shia because they are Shia.\"\n\nIt is unclear what impact such a declaration from the United States will have. Although there are legal definitions associated with the term, there are no legal obligations to enforce a response. The last time a U.S. administration declared genocide during an ongoing conflict was in 2004 when Colin Powell determined it applied to the actions of the Sudanese government in Darfur. That, however, did not compel the U.S. to act.\n\nKerry did not indicate any policy shift in the ongoing U.S.-led effort to degrade and defeat ISIS.",
    " Title: Senator John McCain Calls for Donald Trump to Apologize for Prisoner of War Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona has urged Donald J. Trump to make amends for his derogatory comments about prisoners of war, following the latter's mocking of McCain's capture and imprisonment during the Vietnam War. In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, McCain expressed deep dismay at the tone of the Republican presidential race and called for Trump to apologize to \"a body of American heroes\" he had offended.\n\nDuring the interview, McCain stated that he was personally unaffected by Trump's ridicule but could not tolerate the disrespect shown to veterans in general. When asked if he would campaign with Trump, McCain responded that several conditions would need to be met first.\n\n\"I think it's important for Donald Trump to express his appreciation for veterans\u2014not John McCain, but veterans who were incarcerated as prisoners of war,\" McCain said. \"When he said, 'I don't like people who were captured,' then there's a body of American heroes that I'd like to see him retract that statement\u2014not about me, but about the others.\"\n\nMcCain's comments add to the mounting pressure on Trump to mend relationships within the Republican Party and win over party leaders he has alienated during the 2016 campaign. One of McCain's closest Senate allies, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has already announced that he will not vote for Trump under any circumstances.\n\nMcCain emphasized the need for Trump to \"heal many of the wounds\" from the primary season. The senator described the 2016 race as unprecedented in its personal nature, with candidates' integrity and character being questioned.\n\nNoting the divide within the Republican Party, McCain pointed out the disconnect between party leadership and many of Trump's supporters\u2014mainly older, white, blue-collar workers who see no job prospects.\n\n\"There is some distance, if not a disconnect, between party leadership and members of Congress,\" McCain said, \"and many of the voters who have selected Donald Trump to be the nominee of the party.\"",
    " Title: Decline in Importance of Religious Beliefs in U.S. Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Pew Research Center reveals a significant decline in the importance of a presidential candidate's religious beliefs among American voters. The study, released on Wednesday, indicates that two-thirds of Evangelicals are planning to vote for Donald Trump, while two-thirds of religiously unaffiliated individuals, often referred to as \"nones,\" are supporting Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe study shows a decrease of 10 percentage points in the number of Americans who want a president with strong religious beliefs, down to 62 percent from 2008. This trend is apparent among both Republicans and Democrats, with an 8-point decrease among Republicans and a 13-point decrease among Democrats since 2008.\n\nThe reasons for this decline differ between the two parties. For Republicans, Evangelicals are willing to support less-religious candidates to maintain political influence, while the growing \"nones\" of the Democratic Party are emphasizing secular morality over traditional religion.\n\nGreg Smith, co-author of the study, comments, \"For two election cycles now, we've seen a steady decline in the number of Americans who care if the president has strong beliefs. Maybe the attitudes of some religious groups are changing, but more so, the religious composition of the entire country is changing.\"\n\nEvangelicals face the challenge of choosing between a purist candidate and one with broader appeal. Donald Trump, with his lack of religiosity and playboy lifestyle, is an example of this dilemma for some Evangelicals.\n\nChad Seales, a professor of religion at the University of Texas, Austin, and an expert on Southern Evangelicals, explains, \"Evangelicals know that Trump is not the Ted Cruz candidate. He is not the religious right candidate of the 1990s, but they are making all kinds of concessions to agree with him and reframe him in their world. Trump is the cultural option. There is no doctrine option left.\"\n\nIn the past, Evangelicals have compromised, as seen in the case of Mitt Romney, a devout Mormon and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. More recently, the senior pastor of First Baptist Dallas, Robert Jeffress, focused on secular, not theological, similarities in his endorsement of Donald Trump.\n\nOn the other side, the rise of the \"nones\" appears to be having an effect. In 2012, 25 percent of Americans claimed no religious preference. In the late 1980s, the number was 7 percent. This could be at least partly a reaction to the intense fusing of theological doctrine and politics among religious conservatives, suggests Michael Hout, a sociologist at New York University.\n\n\"Many 'new nones' were people raised Baptist or Catholic but not active,\" he says. \"As those churches became more overtly political over issues like abortion, inactive liberals who used to identify, quit doing so.\"\n\nExperts also note that Democrats are increasingly viewing morality outside of religiousness. \"Nones\" were among Bernie Sanders's strongest supporters in the primary, drawn to his vision of a society that takes better care of all \u2013 from free college to healthcare to a higher minimum wage. They also saw him as a plain speaker whom they could trust.\n\nHowever, they are slow to warm to Clinton's campaign, with the allegations of email misuse and her connections to Wall Street. This indicates a concern about her moral character, which is important because there is a linkage between moral values and leadership, according to Mark Valeri, a professor of religion and politics at the Danforth Center at Washington University.\n\nThe result is a curious situation in which Democrats appear to be more worried about the morality of their candidate than Republicans are. \"On the right, Republican, pro-Trump side, there is less attention to the personal morality of the leader,\" says Professor Valeri. \"But because on the progressive side they do reach for high moral reform, there is a desire that Clinton be able to present herself well motivated morally. That's why the emails, the testimony, the charges, are sticking so hard.\"",
    " Title: Nine California Students Sue State Over Teacher Tenure and Seniority Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nNine California public school students have filed a lawsuit against the state over its laws on teacher tenure, seniority, and other protections that the plaintiffs argue keep subpar educators in classrooms. The trial, which begins on Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, is part of a growing nationwide challenge to union-backed teacher protections aimed at holding educators more accountable for their work.\n\nThe nonjury trial is expected to conclude in March. Theodore J. Boutrous, the lead attorney on the case sponsored by an educational reform group, stated, \"The system is dysfunctional and arbitrary due to these outdated laws that handcuff school administrators.\"\n\nStates across the nation have weakened teaching job protections, including generations-old tenure, to give administrators more flexibility to fire ineffective teachers. Tenure was created in the early 20th century to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory firings based on factors such as gender, nationality, or political beliefs. It established strict rules under which teachers could be dismissed after a probationary period, though opponents claim these rules make it virtually impossible to fire teachers who are not meeting expectations.\n\nThe changes are occurring as states replace virtually automatic \"satisfactory\" teacher evaluations with those linked to teacher performance and base teacher layoffs on performance instead of seniority. Teachers' unions are fighting back, arguing the changes lower morale, deny teachers due process, and unfairly target older teachers. They also say the evaluations are too dependent on standardized tests and that eliminating such protections erases a vital support system for a profession already losing talented people to higher-paid private sector positions.\n\nThe California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers intervened and asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit filed against the state, including the Department of Education, Gov. Jerry Brown, and Superintendent of Public Education Tom Torlakson.\n\n\"It is deceptive and dishonest to pretend that teacher due process rights are unfair to students,\" said California Federation of Teachers President Josh Pechthalt, the parent of a ninth-grade student in the Los Angeles Unified School District. \"Students need a stable, experienced teaching workforce. They won't have one if this lawsuit succeeds in gutting basic teacher rights.\"\n\nJudge Rolf Treu, who will decide the case, rejected a motion to dismiss the case. The lawsuit seeks to declare unconstitutional five statutes within the state education code, including the one on tenure, three others that outline the steps to dismiss a teacher, and the fifth that mandates the last-hired, first-fired rule, which the lawsuit's attorneys say hurts younger, talented teachers.\n\nThe plaintiffs are students primarily from the Los Angeles and Bay areas. They are supported by a nonprofit organization called Students Matter that fights for education equality. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy, who oversees the nation's second-largest school district, will be called to testify by the plaintiffs, Boutrous said.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys claim teachers too often obtain tenure by simply showing up for work\u2014after about 18 months in California. Afterward, bad teachers are almost impossible or too expensive to fire, Boutrous said. \"The school system knowingly puts kids in classrooms with teachers who are grossly substandard,\" Boutrous said, adding that it was crucial to turn to the courts because \"the political system can't fix this.\"\n\nMany districts send substandard teachers to disadvantaged schools instead of dismissing them because those schools are seen as less desirable places to work by experienced teachers, who can have priority where they are assigned, Boutrous said. The California teacher unions say they support improving teacher evaluations and streamlining the dismissal process. However, they argue that these changes should be the work of the Legislature, not the courts.\n\nLaura Lacar, a high school teacher in the ABC School District, fears the law could expand beyond what happens in the classroom. \"It would be very scary to me, if this lawsuit succeeds, to think that I might not have a job next year, not for anything I'd done in the classroom, but because my principal didn't like me, or my clothing, or something I'd said.\"\n\nDeclaring the laws unconstitutional will allow the Legislature to craft legislation that works, the lawsuit's attorneys say. Karen Martinez, who lives in San Jose, said her daughter, Daniella, who is a plaintiff, reached the third grade unable to read before a teacher helped her. \"I'm hoping with all my heart that we win this case, so California can change a system that is clearly failing so many children,\" Karen Martinez said. \"To me, it's common sense: appreciate and reward the teachers who are doing great, and hold accountable the teachers who are failing our kids.\"\n\nTerry Moe, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution who has researched teacher unions and their impact on public education, said there's a long way to go even in states that have adopted new laws. \"Unions can make life difficult for administrators in coming years,\" he said. \"The political pressure on the ground is strong. It's going to be really difficult to follow through on these new laws and put a dent in teacher tenure and really do away with the role of seniority.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Praise for General Robert E. Lee and Its Historical Context\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent event, former President Donald Trump referred to General Robert E. Lee, stating, \"You know who I'm talking about, right? He was incredible. He drank a little bit too much.\" The crowd, including some reporters, understood Trump was referring to Ulysses S. Grant, but not all assembled reporters grasped the reference.\n\nTrump's admiration for Lee is not new, as Lee is part of Trump's familiar pantheon of military leaders, which also includes George S. Patton, Douglas MacArthur, and Ulysses S. Grant. As president, Trump has used Lee's contested memory to stoke divisions, notably during the violent protest against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville in August 2017. Trump's equivocations at a press conference following the event drew criticism for his inability to condemn the tiki-torch fascists, instead declaring there \"were very fine people on both sides.\"\n\nTrump's understanding of the American Civil War has been questioned, as he has little grasp of its causes and tends to downplay the role of slavery. However, the significance of the moment lies in the fact that, until recently, it would have been hard to imagine any president distancing himself from praise for Lee.\n\nIn the 20th century, affection for Lee was deeply personal for some presidents. Woodrow Wilson, the first southerner to win the presidency after Reconstruction, held Lee in high regard. Lee visited Augusta, Georgia, when Wilson was 13, and Wilson savored the memory of standing by Lee's side as a lad. After leaving the presidency, Wilson wrote a hagiographic portrait of Lee for The Journal of Social Forces, holding him up as a \"national hero\" who was \"in some regards unapproachable in the history of our country.\"\n\nLee was held up as the embodiment of Southern honor, duty, and sacrifice, and presidents, including Wilson, advanced the cause of sectional reconciliation by lionizing him. The cause for which Lee had fought, as Grant put it, was \"one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse,\" but this was seldom mentioned. The reconciliation was built on a shared commitment to white supremacy or, at the very least, on the tacit approval of Jim Crow, which went entirely unsaid. Lee's personal cruelty as a slave owner was simply omitted.",
    " Title: Paris Climate Talks: Implications of 2-Degree and 4-Degree Temperature Increases\n\nArticle:\n\nWorld leaders are convening in Paris this month in an effort to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. According to climatologists, the best-case scenario, assuming immediate and significant emissions reductions, is a planetary surface temperature increase of at least 2 degrees Celsius in the coming decades. This seemingly small uptick has profound implications.\n\nRising temperatures will lead to the destruction of plant and animal habitats and reduce yields of essential food crops. More people will be exposed to the devastating effects of flooding and drought. If nations involved in the Paris talks fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures could increase by almost 6 degrees Celsius this century, according to the Committee on Climate Change, an independent advisory body to the U.K. government on climate issues.\n\nThe consequences of a warming planet are already being felt in Alaska, which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the U.S. Rising temperatures have thawed frozen soil in some areas, leaving coastlines vulnerable to storms and tidal activity. Shishmaref, a remote village located 30 miles outside the Arctic circle, is losing as much as 9 feet of land per year\u2014chunks of coastline that simply break into the sea.\n\nPlant and animal habitats face a dire threat from warming temperatures. An increase of 4 degrees Celsius in average planetary temperatures could result in severe habitat loss for almost two-thirds of plant species and one-third of mammal species. Crop yields could also be significantly reduced, with a 60% reduction in maize and spring wheat yields, compared to a 40% reduction for other crops, according to the Committee on Climate Change.\n\nMore people will be threatened by a warming planet, even if nations meeting in Paris curtail carbon emissions. Vulnerable populations living near water or in arid areas will face massive disruptions to their way of life, as flooding and severe drought become more common.\n\n* Coastal flood estimates assume that flood protections evolve with population and wealth.\n* River flood estimates assume that protections do not evolve.\n\nBy 2050, an estimated 2 million to 13 million people each year will be exposed to coastal flooding, roughly equivalent to the population of New Orleans and southern Louisiana. River flooding could affect about 130 million to 250 million people each year, encompassing the entire South and part of the Northeast in the U.S., as well as the entire East and Midwest. Water stress could also impact 1.5 billion to 2 billion people each year, living in areas without enough usable water, almost five times the U.S. population, or six times the current U.S. population.\n\nHuman activity since industrialization has led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas that contributes to rising global temperatures. If carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rates, Earth's temperatures could increase dramatically in future decades, leading to catastrophic and irreversible climate change. The 10 largest emitters produced about 26.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2013.\n\nThe largest emitters per capita are Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, Brunei, and Aruba. The European Union, Russia, Canada, South Korea, Iran, the United States, China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and India are among the largest overall emitters.\n\nCountries responsible for two-thirds of global emissions have made commitments to curb their greenhouse gas production. China, the world's biggest carbon producer, has promised that its carbon emissions will peak by 2030. The United States, the second-largest emitter, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent relative to 2005 levels by 2025. The European Union aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent relative to 1990 levels by 2030. India aims to reduce the ratio of emissions to its GDP by 33 to 35 percent relative to 2005 levels by 2030.",
    " Title: IRS Acknowledges Inappropriate Targeting of Conservative Groups During 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) acknowledged on Friday that it inappropriately flagged conservative groups for additional review during the 2012 election to determine if they were violating their tax-exempt status. Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, made the admission at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association.\n\nLerner confirmed that organizations were singled out because they included the words \"tea party\" or \"patriot\" in their applications for tax-exempt status. In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, she said.\n\n\"That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate,\" Lerner said. \"The IRS would like to apologize for that.\"\n\nLerner stated that the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias. After her talk, she told The Associated Press that no high-level IRS officials knew about the practice. She did not say when they found out.\n\nThe IRS put out a written statement saying protocol was changed at the Cincinnati office in response to the rising number of applications for 501 (c) (4) groups. This classification grants tax-exempt status to social welfare groups. The agents tried to \"centralize work\" in response to the applications, leading to problems the agency claims have since been fixed.\n\nIn all, about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, Lerner said. Of those, about a quarter were singled out because they had \"tea party\" or \"patriot\" somewhere in their applications. Lerner said 150 of the cases have been closed and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.\n\nMany conservative groups complained during the election that they were being harassed by the IRS. They accused the agency of frustrating their attempts to become tax exempt by sending them lengthy, intrusive questionnaires. The forms, which the groups made available at the time, sought information about group members' political activities, including details of their postings on social networking websites and about family members.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said he's \"glad\" to see the IRS apologize but said it's not good enough. \"We need to have ironclad guarantees from the IRS that it will adopt significant protocols to ensure this kind of harassment of groups that have a constitutional right to express their own views never happens again,\" he said, adding that he would be discussing the matter with the IRS commissioner.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said, \"the fact that Americans were targeted by the IRS because of their political beliefs is unconscionable.\"",
    " Title: McCarthy Advocates Senate Approval for Any Future Nuclear Deals, Cites Iran Agreement as Precedent\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has suggested that any potential nuclear deal with North Korea should be submitted to the Senate for approval as a treaty. In an interview with MSNBC's Hugh Hewitt, McCarthy criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Iran nuclear deal, which was not treated as a treaty but rather an executive agreement. He argued that this approach made it easier for President Trump to withdraw the U.S. from the deal earlier this year.\n\nMcCarthy argued that treating nuclear deals as treaties would ensure their longevity and counter concerns about other countries' reluctance to negotiate with the U.S. due to Trump's withdrawal from the Iran deal. He stated, \"The one thing I have found, if it's going to be long-standing, I think treaties are longer standing and supportive from administration to administration.\"\n\nThe California Republican also disputed the notion that Trump's withdrawal from the Iran agreement complicated negotiations with North Korea. He argued that it would be difficult to negotiate with North Korea to end its nuclear program while allowing Iran to develop weapons in the future. McCarthy compared Trump's approach to that of President Reagan in dealing with the Soviet Union, stating that Trump was willing to engage in negotiations when they were going in the desired direction but was also willing to withdraw when they veered off course.",
    " Title: IRS Commissioner Defends Actions Amidst GOP Criticism in Congressional Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nActing IRS Commissioner Steven Miller appeared before a congressional panel on Friday, facing intense questioning from Republicans who accused the agency of systemic abuse. In the first hearing investigating the IRS's practice of targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, Miller apologized for the \"foolish mistakes\" made by employees trying to be more efficient in their workload selection.\n\nHowever, Miller strongly refuted Republican claims that the agency is politicized. He maintained that the practice of flagging key terms in applications for tax exemptions is legal and even praised a civil servant under heavy GOP criticism for working in the agency's scandal-ridden tax-exempt division before helping it implement the health care overhaul.\n\nMiller also asserted that he did not lie to Congress, stating, \"I did not mislead Congress. I answered the questions as they were asked.\"\n\nThe four-hour hearing left Republicans dissatisfied and seeking more information. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) expressed that Miller's answers were \"not very complete.\" He added, \"We\u2019re not done. We found out about this a week ago, so we\u2019re going to continue to examine.\"\n\nMiller stepped down on Wednesday at the request of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. However, Miller told lawmakers that he currently remains in the position as the agency transitions to a new leader. President Barack Obama announced on Thursday that Daniel Werfel, the current controller of the Office of Management and Budget, will succeed Miller as acting IRS commissioner next week.\n\nTwo things became clear during the hearing: the IRS did not inadvertently announce the targeting program last year as initially appeared, and Republicans are dedicated to expanding the scope of their investigation.\n\nMiller indicated that agency officials had discussed how to talk about the controversial targeting program before Lois Lerner, the director of the agency's tax-exempt division, was scheduled to appear at an American Bar Association conference on May 10. Her comments that the agency was wrong to flag nonprofit applications if they included the terms \"tea party\" or \"patriot\" triggered a week-long firestorm.\n\n\"I believe we talked about that,\" Miller said, referring to the discussions in advance of Lerner's public appearance.\n\nRepublicans are also making it clear they don't intend to limit their investigations to the initial news that the IRS gave extra review to groups that used certain terms. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp is also drawing in other IRS actions that have had conservatives stewing for a long time, such as a March 2012 Huffington Post story that disclosed confidential donor information for the National Organization for Marriage.\n\nCamp also cited a ProPublica article that said the IRS had leaked the applications conservative groups had submitted for tax-exempt status.\n\nMeanwhile, Miller maintained the agency's insistence that no one at the IRS told the White House of its activities.\n\nMiller's testimony did not seem to alleviate the outrage that has built among Republicans.",

The visit, which begins on Wednesday in Jerusalem, aims to improve relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and foster peace and democracy in the region.\n\nNetanyahu, who was re-elected in January, formed a new coalition government on Friday, including the centrist Yesh Atid and pro-settler Jewish Home parties, but excluding the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe White House has downplayed expectations, stating that President Obama hopes to facilitate discussions between leaders to advance peace and security. Among the region's significant issues are ongoing peace negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders and the effort to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nThe White House is adopting a strategy to lower expectations to create space for frank peace talks between both sides. The administration is willing to continue playing a facilitating role, but face-to-face talks may be challenging if leaders continue with unilateral actions, such as Israel building settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\n\nIn his visit, President Obama will deliver a speech to an audience of Israeli students, engage in cultural stops, and meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in Ramallah. The president will also make a 24-hour stop in Jordan, focusing on the Syrian conflict, where more than 450,000 Syrians have sought refuge.\n\nObama's visit to Israel may quell criticism that he was less supportive of the Jewish state than his predecessors, a charge leveled by some Republican lawmakers during the 2012 presidential campaign. In his talks with Jordan's King Abdullah, the president will attempt to support the country's efforts to liberalize its government and counter an Arab Spring-style movement.\n\nThe president's final stop will be at Petra, Jordan's fabled ancient city.",

The Democratic head of the Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, announced late Thursday that a vote would occur on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (1500 GMT).\n\nInitially, the committee was expected to approve two articles of impeachment late on Thursday, setting up a vote by the Democratic-controlled House next week. However, as the clock ticked toward midnight, Nadler sent lawmakers home for the night, citing the American public's desire to witness the vote.\n\nThe delay in the vote has caused frustration among Republican leaders, who had planned to travel home on Friday and now need to adjust their schedules. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, expressed his displeasure, stating, \"This was the most bush league thing I have seen, forever.\"\n\nThe impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee extended into the evening as Republicans, led by Collins, offered a series of amendments with no hope of adoption. These amendments were intended to weaken the articles of impeachment, which accuse Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nIf the House impeaches Trump, he would then face a trial in the Senate. The Republican-led Senate is unlikely to vote to find the president guilty and remove him from office.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Election: Write-In Candidates Could Impact Outcome for Moore and Jones\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming Alabama Senate election is expected to be a close race between Democratic candidate Doug Jones and Republican candidate Roy Moore. A strong turnout from rural white voters, a key demographic for Moore, is crucial for his success, while energizing African-American voters is important for Jones.\n\nSmall-population counties, stretching across the state's northern tier and just above the Gulf Coast, are likely to report early. Moore's performance in these counties will provide an early indication of his chances against Jones, who is expected to perform well in Alabama's cities later in the night.\n\nIf Moore achieves similar margins to those he secured in his Republican runoff victory in September, with over 60% of the vote in several rural counties, he is likely to claim victory. However, the presence of write-in candidates could lower the threshold for victory. If write-in candidates perform well, Jones may not need to capture over 50% of the vote to win Tuesday.\n\nIt is historically challenging for an Alabama Democrat to capture over 50% of the vote. However, Jones may not have to capture a majority to win due to the potential impact of write-in candidates.\n\nSenator Richard C. Shelby, a Republican and the state's longest-serving lawmaker, used a national television interview Sunday to remind Alabamians that he had written in the name of another Republican rather than supporting Moore. His example could encourage others in the party to do the same.\n\nTwo write-in candidates have announced their bids: Lee Busby, a Republican and a retired Marine colonel from Tuscaloosa, and the University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, who is widely considered an important figure in the state. The more Republicans or independents who write in the name of a third candidate, the lower the threshold Jones needs to reach to win. Depending on the number of write-ins, he could potentially win even if he only captures 48% of the vote.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Race: Trump Accuses Establishment of Taking Advantage of Country\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a special town hall with Sean Hannity on Wednesday, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump criticized GOP lawmakers who are reportedly working against his campaign, labeling them as individuals \"taking advantage of our country.\" The billionaire businessman referred to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute over the weekend, where the topic of stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination was reportedly discussed. The conference was attended by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and other key Republican congressmen.\n\nTrump stated, \"I know all these people. These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They don't want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They don't want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.\"\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush is also reportedly meeting with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of a GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he may be preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, has denied multiple reports that he has discussed the possibility of dropping out before the winner-take-all contest in Florida's primary next week.\n\nRubio told Megyn Kelly, \"I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida.\" A poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.\n\nRubio also dismissed the possibility of forming a \"unity\" Republican ticket with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race. Cruz, who has opposed a possible convention fight between himself and Trump if neither man reaches the required 1,237 delegates during the primaries, has walked back his earlier opposition to a contested convention.\n\nCruz told Kelly, \"Look, Reagan and President Gerald Ford battled it out at a contested convention [in 1976]... That's what conventions are for.\" However, Cruz restated his opposition to a so-called brokered convention, calling it \"a fever dream of the D.C. establishment\" and warning of \"an open revolt\" among Republican voters if it came to pass.\n\nCruz also criticized Rubio and Trump over immigration reform and the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" bill in 2013. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has staked his campaign's future on victory in next Tuesday's Ohio primary, told Greta Van Susteren that he would \"probably not\" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only \"picked about half the delegates [so far] this year... anything is possible.\" A poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.\n\nTrump currently has 458 delegates, Cruz has 359, Rubio is a distant third with 151 delegates, and Kasich has 54. The next primary is in Florida on Tuesday, March 15.",
    " Title: Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect Pleads Not Guilty to 30 Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nBoston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 30 counts of using a weapon of mass destruction in a federal court in Boston. The charges stem from the Boston Marathon bombing that occurred on April 15.\n\nTsarnaev, 19, entered not guilty pleas to 30 counts, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, malicious destruction of property resulting in death, and bombing a place of public use resulting in death. He spoke in a Russian accent during the arraignment, his first public appearance since his arrest on April 19.\n\nThe arraignment was his first public appearance since he was arrested following the bombings. Tsarnaev wore a partially unbuttoned orange jumpsuit and a black t-shirt, and displayed a crooked smile to two sisters, both in Muslim garb, seated in the courtroom. He looked unable to sit still and had a cast on his left arm and hand.\n\nPublic defender Judy Clarke attempted to enter a single \"not guilty\" plea on Tsarnaev's behalf and have it apply to all counts in the indictment. However, Judge Marianne Bowler asked that Tsarnaev speak for himself and that all the charges be read aloud. Flanked by his two attorneys, Tsarnaev said only two words \u2013 \"not guilty\" \u2013 repeating them seven times as prosecutors read the charges against him. Each of the 30 counts could bring a life-in-prison sentence, with 17 being eligible for the death penalty if the government decides to seek capital punishment.\n\nTsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police following a massive manhunt three days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured the next day \u2013 wounded and bloodied from the shootout \u2013 after a Watertown homeowner noticed blood on his dry-docked boat. Police found the suspect hiding inside.\n\nAuthorities say the brothers were inspired by al-Qaeda publications and that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left a confession in the boat justifying the bombings as payback for U.S. military action in Muslim countries. He wrote that the U.S. government was \"killing our innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"I do not like killing innocent people,\" he said, but also wrote: \"I cannot stand to see such evil go unpunished... We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\"\n\nTsarnaev's arrest stunned those who knew him as a likable high school athlete in Cambridge, Mass., where he lived with his older brother after his parents left for Russia. The indictment also said that, sometime before the bombings, Tsarnaev downloaded Internet material from Islamic extremists that advocated violence against the perceived enemies of Islam.\n\nThree people \u2013 Martin Richard, 8, Krystle Marie Campbell, 29, and Lingzi Lu, 23 \u2013 were killed by the bombs, which were improvised from pressure cookers. Authorities say the Tsarnaevs also killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology officer Sean Collier days later while they were on the run.",
    " Title: House Democrats Plan Wide-Ranging Investigations and Potential Impeachment Proceedings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the midterm elections, incoming House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has revealed a list of at least 85 potential targets for investigations and subpoenas related to President Donald Trump. The incoming majority is expected to face resistance from the White House, potentially leading to legal battles that could reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe power dynamics between the presidency, Congress, and the Supreme Court will be tested as top Democrats, who had previously avoided the topic during the campaign, now plan to explore possible grounds for impeachment. Robert Mueller's public report could serve as the catalyst for impeachment proceedings.\n\nTom Steyer, a liberal activist who spent over $100 million during the campaign to build support for impeachment, stated that those trying to delay impeachment discussions are the \"outliers.\" According to Steyer, 80% of registered Democrats support impeachment.\n\nSchiff, in an interview with \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 on HBO,\" stated that he aims to assist Special Counsel Robert Mueller and plans to release, with redactions of classified material, transcripts of dozens of interviews conducted during the Intelligence Committee's own Russia probe. These transcripts contain possible contradictions with other testimony and facts, potentially placing witnesses, including White House officials and alumni, in legal jeopardy.\n\nSchiff stated, \"I want to make sure that Bob Mueller has the advantage of the evidence that we've been able to gather.\" He added, \"But equally important: that Bob Mueller is in a position to determine whether people knowingly committed perjury before our committee.\"\n\nWhen asked about potential contradictions between the testimony of Roger Stone, a close ally of the Trump campaign, and emails that have surfaced since then, Schiff responded, \"That is certainly the case.\"\n\nSchiff also stated, \"We're going to want to look at what leverage the Russians may have over the president of the United States.\"\n\nIncoming House Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey of New York, a close ally of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, has also signaled a willingness to investigate a wide range of issues, including the Space Force, hurricane relief in Puerto Rico, White House security clearances, White House use of personal email, and more.\n\nLowey stated, \"We have our boxing gloves on. I'm ready. And so is Nancy.\"\n\nBoth Lowey and Schiff acknowledged a list of potential investigation targets provided by House Republicans as a starting point, with further probes expected into matters such as James Comey's firing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions' ouster, the Muslim travel ban, family separation policy at the border, discussions of classified information at Mar-a-Lago, administration dealings with North Korea and Saudi Arabia, and more.\n\nPresident Trump has already signaled a confrontational stance, stating at his post-election news conference that if Democrats investigate him, the result will be \"a warlike posture.\" When asked if he would investigate the Democrats, Trump replied, \"Oh, yeah. Better than them.\"\n\nFor 225+ years, federal courts have upheld the Constitution's mandate of Congress as an equal branch of government, providing checks and balances on the executive. As House Democrats assume power, they have a strong position to carry out their investigative agenda.",
    " Title: Republican Candidates Tap into Social Conservative Narrative of Victimhood and Oppression\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Republican presidential nomination, several candidates are echoing a narrative of victimhood and oppression that resonates with social conservatives. This narrative suggests that the forces of secularism are consolidating their gains and preparing to make it all but illegal to be a Christian.\n\nIn a speech at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, Jeb Bush stated, \"There are consequences when you do not genuflect to the latest secular dogmas.\" Bobby Jindal claims the left wants to \"essentially outlaw firmly held religious beliefs that they do not agree with.\" Marco Rubio warns that opposing same-sex marriage could lead to the argument that the teachings of mainstream Christianity are hate speech. Mike Huckabee asserts, \"We are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity.\"\n\nWhile these assertions may seem extreme, they reflect the concerns of many on the religious right. They feel that the rapid change in public opinion and laws on gay rights, as well as broader societal shifts away from traditional values, is a threat to their beliefs.\n\nAccording to recent data from the Pew Research Center, Christians made up 70.6 percent of the American population in 2014, down 8 points from just seven years before. Meanwhile, the population of the \"unaffiliated\" - atheists, agnostics, and people who do not identify with any religion in particular - has grown to 23 percent of the public. The trend is particularly pronounced among millennials, with only 56 percent identifying as Christian and 35 percent as unaffiliated.\n\nThis sense of being a minority in a society that no longer shares their values is not unique to conservative Christians. However, they have constructed an uplifting story for themselves, where their supposed persecution gives them nobility and heroism. They see themselves as courageous revolutionaries, underdogs fighting the odds on behalf of their principles and God's desires.\n\nLiberals may dismiss this kind of rhetoric, but it is mostly sincere and will likely become louder as social progress continues in its current direction. It will be particularly interesting to see what the candidates say if the Supreme Court rules that gay people have a constitutional right to marry, as it may well do in a matter of weeks.",
    " Title: Lugar Center Releases Bipartisan Index, Highlights Rising Political Polarization in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Lugar Center, a think tank founded by former Indiana Republican Senator Richard Lugar and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy, has released its inaugural Bipartisan Index, ranking members of Congress based on their cooperation across party lines. The rankings are based on lawmakers' sponsorship and co-sponsorship of bills and measure the degree to which they succeeded in attracting co-sponsors from the opposing party and crossed the aisle to co-sponsor others' bills during the last two Congresses.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Lugar Center, as reported by Real Clear Politics, the Bipartisan Index offers the public an objective way to measure how frequently their members of Congress are cooperating with the other party on matters of policy. The Lugar Center aims to incentivize members of Congress to be more bipartisan when writing legislation and making co-sponsorship decisions, as well as keeping an open mind about legislation introduced by the other party.\n\nThe Lugar Center, which focuses on issues such as nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, global food security, foreign assistance effectiveness and global development, energy security, and enhancing bipartisan governance, plans to release lifetime rankings of each member of Congress dating back to 1993 later this year, according to Real Clear Politics.\n\nHowever, the 112th and 113th Congresses were the most partisan since 1993, as reported by USA Today. The Lugar Center came up with historical average scores for members of the minority and majority parties, and then lawmakers in the last Congress were compared to the baseline to see whether they ranked above or below average.\n\nOnly a little more than one-third of those serving from 2013-2014 were ranked \"bipartisan,\" according to USA Today, with top scorers in the Senate including Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Those ranked as least bipartisan included Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nIn the House, GOP Reps. Christopher Gibson and Peter King of New York ranked most bipartisan, while Reps. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., and Donna Edwards, D-Md., were least bipartisan.\n\nThe scores of presidential candidates in the Senate were all in the bottom half of the index, according to Real Clear Politics, including Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, Cruz, and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\"Right now, most citizens are unhappy with the lack of progress in Congress, the lack of legislation moving forward or \u2014 worse still \u2014 such tie-ups that the government may shut down or be threatened with being shut down from time to time,\" Lugar told USA Today.\n\nThe trend has been noted before. Tracking voting patterns since the early 1950s, CQ Roll Call has found that partisanship and polarization are driving legislative behavior more than in any other period since at least the start of the Eisenhower administration, according to USA Today. The Washington Post, reporting last month on a diagram of partisanship for each House of Representatives from 1949 to 2011, shows that starting in the 1990s, \"the parties began pulling apart from each other, like a single cell dividing into two,\" and that \"in the 2000s, there are hardly any links between the parties at all.\"",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Race: Moore's Loyal Base Remains Steadfast Amidst Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Alabama Senate race, Republican nominee Roy Moore has faced a wave of allegations regarding past sexual misconduct, causing some conservative voters to reconsider their support. However, Moore's long-time supporters, who have backed him in statewide races for chief justice, governor, and senator for two decades, remain steadfast in their allegiance.\n\nJohnny Williams, a 77-year-old retired bus charter company owner, expressed his continued support for Moore. \"I've seen him fighting at those fires, and I just believe in him,\" Williams said in an interview.\n\nAnn Eubanks, a 68-year-old Birmingham resident who leads a tea party group, also voiced her support for Moore. \"I am a policy voter,\" Eubanks said. \"I refuse to send a far-left liberal Democrat to Congress. There's too much at stake in this country at this point with the balance of the Senate at critical mass.\"\n\nIssues such as future Supreme Court nominations, repealing Obamacare, building the wall, and immigration proposals are key concerns for Eubanks and other Moore supporters, who believe the president will need every vote he can muster in the Senate to advance his legislative agenda.\n\nDespite this loyal base, Moore is facing challenges in winning over other Alabama voters who typically vote Republican. Richard Barnett, a 66-year-old metals and welding company general manager, stated he was not a fan of Moore before the allegations surfaced and will not vote for him. Barnett, who has not voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter, may write-in Sen. Luther Strange, Moore's primary opponent, instead.\n\nIn some Republican communities, such as Hoover, Alabama, where Barnett resides, there is a noticeable lack of public support for Moore, with more visible support for Democratic nominee Doug Jones.\n\nWinning over these voters could be crucial to Moore's victory. The Moore campaign is optimistic, as President Trump held a rally Friday night in Pensacola, Florida, just 25 miles from the Alabama state line, to encourage people to vote for Moore.\n\nHowever, not everyone is enthused about the election. At a Waffle House in Birmingham, one waitress, Nona, expressed her reluctance to vote for any of the candidates on Tuesday, citing Moore's behavior as \"not Christian.\"",
    " Title: Tens of Thousands Gather at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial to Commemorate 50th Anniversary of \"I Have a Dream\" Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nTens of thousands of individuals marched to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and down the National Mall on Saturday, commemorating the 50th anniversary of King's famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The event, which served as a tribute to a generation of activists who endured hardships such as fire hoses, police abuse, and indignities to demand equality for African Americans, emphasized the unfinished nature of King's dream.\n\nMartin Luther King III, the oldest son of the slain civil rights leader, stated, \"This is not the time for nostalgic commemoration. Nor is this the time for self-congratulatory celebration. The task is not done. The journey is not complete. We can and we must do more.\"\n\nEric Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, highlighted the significant role those who marched played in his career and President Barack Obama's presidency. \"They marched in spite of animosity, oppression, and brutality because they believed in the greatness of what this nation could become and despaired of the founding promises not kept,\" Holder said.\n\nHolder mentioned gays, Latinos, women, and the disabled as groups yet to fully realize Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Other attendees advocated for organized labor, voting rights, revamping immigration policies, and access to local post offices.\n\nRep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the only surviving speaker from the 1963 March on Washington, criticized a recent Supreme Court decision that weakened a key anti-discrimination provision of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis was a leader of the 1965 march, where police beat and gassed marchers who demanded access to voting booths.\n\n\"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala., for the right to vote,\" he said. \"I am not going to stand by and let the Supreme Court take the right to vote away from us. You can not stand by. You can not sit down. You've got to stand up. Speak up, speak out, and get in the way.\"\n\nOrganizers anticipated about 100,000 people to participate in the event, a precursor to the actual anniversary of the Aug. 28, 1963, march that drew some 250,000 to the National Mall and ushered in the idea of massive, nonviolent demonstrations.\n\nMarchers began arriving early Saturday, many staking out their spots as the sun rose in a clear sky over the Capitol. By midday, tens of thousands had gathered on the National Mall.\n\nLynda Chambers, 58, gave up a day's pay to attend because her retail job does not provide paid vacation. Even as a 7-year-old at the time of the original march, she felt alienated and deprived of her rights. Remembering those feelings, she said, she was compelled to make the trip Saturday.\n\n\"I wanted to have some sort of connection to what I have always known, as far as being a black person,\" she said.\n\nLongtime activist Al Sharpton, now an MSNBC host, implored young black men to respect women and reminded them that two of the leading figures in the civil rights movement of the 1960s were women.\n\nSpeakers frequently mentioned persistent high unemployment among blacks, which is about twice that of white Americans, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida. Along the Mall, Martin's picture was nearly as ubiquitous as King's.\n\nNancy Norman, of Seattle, said she was disappointed more people who look like her had not attended. She is white. However, the 58-year-old said she was glad to hear climate change discussed alongside voting rights.\n\n\"I'm the kind of person who thinks all of those things are interconnected. Climate change is at the top of my list,\" said Norman. \"I don't think it's one we can set aside for any other discussion.\"\n\nThose in attendance arrived in a post-9/11 Washington that was very different from the one civil rights leaders visited in 1963. Then, people crowded the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and could get close to King to hear his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Saturday's speakers were also on the memorial's steps, but metal barriers kept people away from the reflecting pool and only a small group of attendees was allowed near the memorial Saturday.\n\nThere was a media area and VIP seating. Everyone else had been pushed back and watched and listened to the speeches on big-screen televisions. Police were stationed atop the Lincoln Memorial. After the speeches, marchers walked from there, past the King Memorial, then down the National Mall to the Washington Monument, a distance of just over a mile.\n\nOn the day of the anniversary, President Barack Obama will speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He will be joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Churches and groups have been asked to ring bells at 3 p.m. Wednesday, marking the exact time King spoke.\n\nJoseph Lowery, who founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference along with King, urged the crowd to continue working for King's ideals.\n\n\"We've come to Washington to commemorate,\" the 92-year-old civil rights leader said, \"and we're going home to agitate.\"",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Initiates Key Vote on Gun Laws Following Newtown Shootings\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has initiated a series of key votes on gun control legislation on Thursday, marking the first significant move in Congress to address firearm regulations since the tragic shootings at a Connecticut elementary school in December.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the panel approved a bill making gun trafficking a federal crime, with the vote standing at 11-7. The bill, titled \"Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms,\" was sponsored by Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D-VT). Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) was the only Republican to support the measure.\n\nThe committee is considering four pieces of legislation, including:\n\n1. The \"assault weapons ban of 2013,\" sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).\n2. The \"stop illegal trafficking in firearms\" act, put forward by Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D-VT).\n3. New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer's \"protecting responsible gun sellers act of 2013,\" which would expand background checks for gun buyers.\n4. The \"school safety enhancements act of 2013\" from Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA).\n\nThe Democratic-controlled committee is expected to vote in favor of all four bills, meaning they would then be considered by the full Senate. However, the bills' prospects after that are uncertain, as reported by The Hill. The decision to stage separate votes rather than bundle the measures together allows centrist Democrats to selectively support elements of the proposed legislation.\n\nThe most controversial measure, the assault weapons ban, is not automatically included in the package, thereby preserving the prospects for less contentious reforms. The Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid (D-NV), has vowed to bring to the floor whatever Leahy can move through his committee. However, Reid is also a long-time opponent of tougher gun laws, including President Obama's push for a ban on assault weapons. Senate Republicans are also reportedly unified against most of Obama's gun-reform proposals.\n\nGun-control supporters are focusing on one element of Obama's package they see as low-hanging fruit: an expansion of the criminal background check system for gun purchases. The bills would also face uphill battles in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nWe will provide updates on the committee votes as they occur.",
    " Title: New Polls Show Close Race Ahead of First Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo days before the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a new poll indicates that most Americans see the incumbent as the favorite in the first showdown. According to an ABC News/Washington Post national poll released on Monday, 55% of likely voters believe President Obama will win the debate, with 31% predicting that Romney will be victorious.\n\nThe findings on this question from the new survey align with a CNN/ORC International poll conducted after the Democratic convention earlier this month, where 59% of likely voters said Obama would do a better job in the October debates, compared to 34% who favored Romney.\n\nThe first debate between the president and Romney will take place on Wednesday in Denver, Colorado. Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney's running mate, will face off once.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post poll, 49% of likely voters say they would vote for President Obama if the election were held today, with 47% saying they would vote for Romney. The president's two-point margin is within the survey's sampling error. A new Politico/George Washington University Battleground poll also released on Monday indicates 49% for Obama and 47% for Romney among likely voters nationwide.\n\nThe two new surveys follow a Fox News poll released late last week, which indicated a five-point advantage for the president. A CNN Poll of Polls, which averages all three surveys together, puts Obama at 49% and Romney at 46% among likely voters.\n\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted from September 26-29, with 1,001 adults nationwide, including 929 registered voters and 813 likely voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error for likely voters is plus or minus 4 percentage points. The Politico/George Washington University Battleground poll was conducted from September 24-27, with 1,000 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nIn other campaign news, Ann Romney is set to rally, while President Obama prepares for the debate across town.

    " Title: Centrist Strategy Drives Historic Progress in Gay Rights Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Avlon, a political commentator, asserts that the success of the gay rights movement, particularly the issue of same-sex marriage, is a historic milestone in the United States. The movement has gained significant momentum, with a majority of Americans now supporting same-sex marriage, a stark contrast to just 27% a decade ago.\n\nRecent political endorsements of marriage equality by figures like Hillary Clinton, Jon Huntsman, and Rob Portman, as well as the increasing support among younger Republicans and evangelicals, reflect this shift in public opinion.\n\nAvlon attributes this progress to a strategic shift in the movement's approach, moving away from divisive street theater tactics towards building bridges beyond the base. This includes outreach to Republicans and making conservative arguments for same-sex marriage.\n\nTed Olson, a former solicitor general under the Bush administration, and David Boies, who was Olson's opponent in the Bush v Gore Supreme Court case, are examples of this strategic shift. They argued that California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage, was unconstitutional.\n\nOlson and Boies, a Republican and a Democrat respectively, emphasize the need to focus on common ground and broad principles rather than partisan politics and positional bargaining. Their partnership represents a dynamic approach to problem-solving, creating new coalitions and overturning decades of stereotypes about the split-the-difference impulse of the \"mushy middle.\"\n\nThe movement's success is also attributed to strategic use of language, with terms like \"freedom to marry\" and \"marriage equality\" being preferred over \"gay marriage.\" This emphasis on individual freedom and civil rights helps humanize the issue and create unexpected common ground.\n\nAvlon suggests that this centrist strategy, which depolarizes issues and creates new coalitions, is effective and can be replicated in other areas to solve problems through addition rather than division. The shift in public opinion overturns centuries of established thought about marriage and reflects the durability and flexibility of the American democratic system.\n\nRegardless of the Supreme Court's ultimate decision on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, the movement of same-sex marriage from the margins to the mainstream has been achieved. The centrist model by which it moved forward can serve as a blueprint for future progress in other areas.",

This development, first reported by CNN, indicates progress in the talks between Mueller and Trump's legal team regarding the president answering questions in the investigation.\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani stated last month that Mueller wanted the president to commit to a follow-up interview if written questions were provided, a position Trump's legal team was resisting. The question of a potential interview has not yet been settled, but a source told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Mueller is willing to accept written answers to questions without a commitment from Trump's lawyers over what comes next.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Giuliani told \u2588\u2588\u2588: \"We are not prepared to agree to more questions until the first group of questions are asked, answered, and somebody can explain to us why that isn't enough.\" Giuliani reiterated that Trump would be willing to answer questions on whether his campaign had colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 election, but not whether he had acted to obstruct the Russia probe.\n\nIn an NBC News interview last year, Trump tied his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey to the investigation into Russian election meddling. At the time of his firing, Comey was leading the probe. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to tip it toward Trump and away from his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton. Moscow has denied any interference, while Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and any obstruction of justice.",
    " Title: Biden and Obama Continue Pursuit of Assault Weapons Ban Despite Senate Setback\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's decision to allow only Senator Dianne Feinstein to offer her assault weapons ban legislation as an amendment, rather than granting it a full vote on the Senate floor, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden remain hopeful that the ban will eventually pass.\n\nDuring a recent interview, Vice President Biden expressed his continued support for the assault weapons ban, stating, \"I am still pushing that it pass. We are still pushing that it pass.\" Biden recalled the initial resistance faced when the first assault weapons ban was attached to the Biden Crime bill in 1994, stating that it was declared dead several times.\n\nWhen asked about the lack of Democratic support for the ban, Biden responded, \"Look, last time we passed it we only had seven Republican votes in 1994.\" Biden emphasized that he does not find it logical to support a measure and declare that there is no possibility of it passing.\n\nVice President Biden's confidence stems from his past experience with the issue. Having been a key figure in the passage of the assault weapons ban once before, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein and others, Biden believes that the process may not necessarily unfold in one step. He cited the example of the assault weapons ban being part of the so-called Biden Crime Bill, which initially had 100,000 amendments removed, then reinstated, and eventually separated as the Brady Bill for background checks.\n\nAs the fight for gun control continues, the Department of Justice, ATF, and other regulatory agencies are expected to play a significant role in the ongoing efforts. Vice President Biden was recently in New York for an event with NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, like Biden, continues to advocate for more gun control measures despite Senator Feinstein's failure to secure Democratic support for her assault weapons legislation.",

The shooting resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries.\n\nPresident Obama, who had planned to hold Florida campaign rallies in Fort Myers and Orlando, canceled the Orlando event and transformed the Fort Myers appearance into a somber affair. Obama's speech focused on prayer, reflection, and the fragility of life, rather than political applause lines or campaign rhetoric.\n\nObama stated, \"If there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's the reminder that life is very fragile. Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things, not the trivial things which so often consume us in our daily lives. Ultimately, it's how we choose to treat each other and how we love one another.\"\n\nRomney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, addressed a crowd in Bow, New Hampshire, where he was initially scheduled for a campaign event. Romney's speech emphasized grieving, remembering, and helping those in need. He said, \"Today is a moment to grieve and remember, and to reach out and to help, to appreciate our blessings in life.\"\n\nBoth the Obama and Romney campaigns pulled their political ads in Colorado out of respect for the victims and to avoid any appearance of crassness in a key battleground state. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also called on both candidates to provide specific details on how they would combat gun violence in the nation.",
    " Title: U.S. Ebola Case Raises Questions About Government Transparency and Trust\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent diagnosis of the first Ebola case in the United States has sparked controversy and raised questions about the government's transparency and trustworthiness. On Sept. 16, President Obama held a news conference at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, where he stated that the Ebola situation in West Africa was \"spiraling out of control\" and that the chances of Ebola coming to America were \"extremely low.\" However, on Sept. 20, Liberian Ebola carrier Thomas Eric Duncan arrived in the United States, just four days after the president's comments.\n\nThe Obama administration's handling of the Ebola crisis has been met with criticism, as some argue that the president's refusal to suspend flights into the United States from Ebola-infected countries may have contributed to the virus' arrival in the country. The administration's messaging has also been called into question, with some officials, including CDC Director Tom Frieden, repeating the narrative that Ebola could only be transmitted if one was in direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of someone who is very sick.\n\nHowever, this narrative was exposed as misleading when Dr. Frieden was asked to reassure viewers that Ebola was not \"highly contagious\" on CNN. Dr. Frieden was compelled to admit that standing within a three-foot radius of someone with Ebola poses a risk of infection, contradicting the CDC's previous guidelines.\n\nThe Ebola crisis has also highlighted the media's role in holding the government accountable. Some argue that the media's lack of curiosity about the truth has allowed federal officials to mislead the public, while others credit the media for exposing the truth and holding officials accountable.\n\nTammy Bruce, a radio talk-show host, author, and Fox News contributor, commented on the situation, stating, \"Americans have been through a great deal since the Founding itself...Politicians do, however, have another reason to keep information from us: Each failure of the system exposes their incompetence.\"\n\nThe Ebola crisis has raised important questions about the government's transparency and trustworthiness, and the role of the media in holding the government accountable. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the government will respond and whether the public will regain trust in their leaders.",
    " Title: Rep. Ilhan Omar's Remarks on Israel Spark Backlash, Allegations of Anti-Semitism\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) has faced criticism from members of both political parties following her remarks about a prominent lobbying group allegedly paying members of Congress to support Israel. The controversy began after Omar responded to a Twitter post by journalist Glenn Greenwald criticizing House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for threatening to take action against Omar and fellow freshman lawmaker Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) over allegedly anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Omar, who became the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress in November, quoted a 1997 rap song by Puff Daddy and responded to a tweet by Batya Ungar-Sargon, the opinion editor of The Forward newspaper, with \"AIPAC!\" referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). AIPAC regularly has been accused by progressives of agitating for a conflict with Iran.\n\nAIPAC responded to Omar's tweet, stating, \"We are proud that we are engaged in the democratic process to strengthen the US-Israel relationship. Our bipartisan efforts are reflective of American values and interests. We will not be deterred in any way by ill-informed and illegitimate attacks on this important work.\"\n\nOther freshman Democrat Max Rose of New York tweeted that Omar's statements \"are deeply hurtful to Jews, including myself.\" In a statement, Rose said, \"When someone uses hateful and offensive tropes and words against people of my faith, I will not be silent. At a time when anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise, our leaders should not be invoking hurtful stereotypes and caricatures of Jewish people to dismiss those who support Israel.\"\n\nHouse GOP conference chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) called for House Democrat leaders to remove Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Zudhi Jasser, a physician and President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, argued that removing Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee would be a \"good first step, followed by a swift sanction against @IlhanMN for bigotry unfit for the US Congress with removal from all committees. Ignoring this would bring the 'bigotry of low expectations' to a new low for Muslims.\"\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to take action against Omar and asked if other House Democrats would \"care to comment on the outrageous anti-Semitism being spewed by one of your f\u00eated members?\"\n\nChelsea Clinton tweeted, \"We should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism.\" Meghan McCain, daughter of late Arizona Senator John McCain, lauded Clinton for calling out anti-Semitism \"on all sides, in all spaces, no matter how uncomfortable.\"\n\nOmar's remarks are the latest in a long line of statements that critics have slammed as anti-Semitic. In 2012, she tweeted, \"Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. # Gaza # Palestine # Israel.\" She did not apologize for posting the tweet until last month. In January, Omar argued in a Yahoo! News interview that Israel could not be considered a democracy and compared it to the Islamic theocracy in Iran.\n\nOmar and Tlaib have faced criticism for their views on Israel in the past, and in February, Tlaib was barred from entering Israel due to her support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Omar and Tlaib have both faced calls to resign from their positions in Congress over their views on Israel.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Denies Shift in Immigration Stance Amidst 2016 Presidential Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush has vehemently denied allegations that he has changed his stance on immigration reform, as other potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates position themselves on the issue.\n\nIn interviews on Sunday talk shows, Mr. Bush reiterated his support for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, aligning himself with a bipartisan group of senators working on such legislation. His recent book, \"Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution,\" which outlines a \"pathway to residency\" for those in the country illegally, has drawn criticism from both the right and the left.\n\nIn his book, Mr. Bush suggests a path to residency rather than citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the U.S., requiring them to leave the country and reapply if they wish to obtain U.S. citizenship. Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the \"Gang of Eight\" and a South Carolina Republican, stated last week that such a stance \"undercuts\" the senators' efforts.\n\nHowever, Mr. Bush maintains that he and Senator Graham are on the same page, and that his views on the issue have remained consistent despite earlier support for a pathway to citizenship. \"I haven't changed,\" he said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"I support a path to legalization or citizenship so long as the path for people that have been waiting patiently is easier and costs less, the legal entrance to our country, than illegal entrance.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid criticized Mr. Bush last week, stating, \"Let's wait for a few minutes and see how Jeb Bush changes his mind, again. His opinion on immigration is not evolving; it's devolving. He keeps going backwards.\"\n\nPresident Obama, who had pledged to pass comprehensive immigration reform in his first term, has made the issue one of his top priorities for his second. However, Republicans working on the issue face a delicate balance between distancing themselves from the president and potentially alienating Latino voters. Republican Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky criticized a leaked framework for immigration reform last month that included a path to citizenship. Mr. Rubio, whose parents emigrated from Cuba, supports a pathway to citizenship for those currently in the U.S. illegally, and Mr. Bush stated his views \"absolutely\" coincide with those.\n\nMr. Bush also dismissed the notion that the events of the past week or his book were motivated by political maneuvering for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. \"That's the Washington world, the world of everything has to have a personal political ambition, motive,\" he said. \"That's not the case. The book was written last year at a time when the tenor of the debate on immigration was dramatically different than it is today.\"",
    " Title: Colorado Democrats Advance Firearm Restrictions as National Debate Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a politically charged atmosphere, Colorado Democrats have advanced firearm restrictions, as the debate over the proposed measures intensified on Monday. Hundreds of gun rights supporters gathered at the state Capitol, with car horns blaring throughout the day, while inside, advocates for gun control, including the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and victims of mass shootings, urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks and implement more gun controls.\n\nThe state has become a focal point in the national debate over new gun laws in the wake of recent mass shootings, including an attack at a suburban Denver movie theater last summer, which brought to mind the Columbine High School shooting of 1999 for many in the state and across the nation.\n\nLawmakers in the politically moderate state are considering a package of gun control measures, including plans that would limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds and expand background checks to include private sales and online purchases. Both measures cleared Democratic-controlled committees on 3-2 party-line votes but still need approval from the full Senate, which could debate the bills as soon as this week.\n\nRetired astronaut and Navy captain Mark Kelly, the husband of Gabrielle Giffords, told lawmakers that he and his wife support the Second Amendment, but he said the right to bear arms should not extend to criminals and the mentally ill. Kelly compared the different background check requirements for private and retail sales to having two different lines at the airport, one with security and one without.\n\n\"Which one do you think the terrorist is going to choose?\" he asked.\n\nGiffords, a former Democratic congresswoman from Tucson, Ariz., was severely wounded in a mass shooting in January 2011 while meeting with constituents.\n\nGun control opponents say the proposals will not reduce violence. They argue that lawmakers should focus on strengthening access to mental health services for people who could be dangerous to communities.\n\nThe bill hearings were at times testy, and included some outbursts from the audience. After one bill passed, someone leaving the committee yelled \"That sucks!\" to lawmakers.\n\n\"I've never seen such unprofessional behavior,\" Democratic Sen. Irene Aguilar told the audience at one point.\n\nMeanwhile, gun rights advocates complained that lawmakers limited testimony time and many did not have a chance to speak on proposals.\n\nThe commotion at the Capitol underscored the attention the debate has generated nationally from gun rights groups, such as the National Rifle Association, to victims' families and White House officials.\n\nSeveral bills before state senators have already cleared the House. And because Democrats control both chambers of the state Legislature, some of the proposals have a strong chance of passing.\n\nOther measures that picked up initial Senate approval would place new restrictions on gun ownership by people convicted in domestic violence cases, and another requires gun buyers to pay for their own background checks.\n\nThe state's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, supports magazine limits and expanded background checks. He has not indicated where he stands on other measures, including whether he supports a proposal that would hold sellers and owners of assault weapons liable for shootings by such firearms.\n\nGun rights supporters walked the Capitol halls wearing stickers that read, \"I Vote Pro-Gun.\" Several dozen people outside the Capitol waved American flags as light snow fell, and a small plane flew overhead carrying a banner with a message for the governor, \"HICK: DO NOT TAKE OUR GUNS!\"\n\nOne of the nation's largest producers of ammunition magazines, Colorado-based Magpul, has threatened to leave the state if lawmakers restrict the size of its products. Its founder said smaller magazines can be easily connected to each other, and the company fears it would legally liable if people were to do that.\n\nAbout 20 Colorado sheriffs opposed the expanded background checks and the magazine limits. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of lawmakers in committee, they said that both bills were unenforceable.\n\n\"This bill just doesn't make any sense from our perspective,\" Pueblo Sheriff Kirk Taylor said about the bill to limit magazine sizes.\n\nVictims who have lost relatives to gun violence say it's time for legislators to take action.\n\nTom Sullivan, whose son Alex was among the 12 killed in the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting, was among the people urging lawmakers to pass magazine restrictions.\n\n\"He was enjoying the movie one second, and then the next second he was dead,\" Tom Sullivan said.\n\nJane Dougherty, whose sister, Mary Sherlach, was a psychologist killed in the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., has been lobbying Colorado lawmakers to pass new gun laws. She said she does not understand gun owners who worry the bills are putting a burden on their rights.\n\nShe said the Connecticut shooter used \"the same type of weapon that we use in war\" to \"slaughter these babies\" and asked lawmakers for stricter gun laws.\n\n\"We can not wait for yet another massacre to transpire,\" Dougherty said.",
    " Title: Biden Reverses Stance on Abortion Funding Amidst Criticism from Democratic Rivals\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden has reversed his stance on the Hyde Amendment, a law that restricts federal funding for abortions, following mounting criticism from his fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nAt a Democratic gala on Thursday, Mr. Biden denounced the Hyde Amendment, stating he believed healthcare is a right. The party's current front-runner added that he made \"no apologies\" for having previously supported the amendment.\n\nElizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke were among those who had recently criticized his stance. Mr. Biden had long voiced support for the Hyde Amendment, a law passed in 1976, right after the Roe v Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion across the U.S.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, written by Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican congressman, in 1976, states that \"none of the funds contained in this Act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\" This means that the vast majority of women receiving federal assistance through the low-income healthcare program Medicaid would be blocked from using that money for abortion services, which can often cost several hundred dollars.\n\nIn 1994, under Democratic President Bill Clinton, the Hyde Amendment was updated to include exceptions in cases of rape or incest.\n\nSpeaking at a gala by the Democratic National Committee in Atlanta, Mr. Biden said the amendment was now incompatible with his views on universal health coverage.\n\n\"If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I want to be clear. I make no apologies for my last position. I make no apologies for what I'm about to say.\"\n\nMr. Biden said he was \"working through the finer details\" of his healthcare plan and had been \"struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents.\" He cited the recent push by conservative state legislatures nationwide to enact restrictions on abortion or an outright ban, as Alabama did, as one of the reasons for his policy change.\n\nOn Friday, University of Alabama trustees voted to return a $26.5 million gift after the donor called on students to boycott the institution over the state's abortion law, but the school told the Associated Press the decision was made due to the donor's demands about how the money would be used.\n\n\"Times have changed,\" the former vice-president said. \"I do not think these guys are going to let up.\" He did not mention the attacks on his stance from his party members.\n\nMr. Biden is a practicing Roman Catholic who has previously said he personally opposes abortion, but does not think he should impose his religious beliefs on others.\n\nJoe Biden's original opposition to taxpayer-funded abortion was not so much out of step with the American public as it was in conflict with the active and vocal base of the Democratic Party. It's a base that passionately, and with valid reason, feels that abortion rights in the U.S. are under the strongest attack in decades. They want to know that Democratic presidential candidates won't waver in support of the procedure's continued legality.\n\nThe former vice-president's position on the subject, while drawing ire and fire from opponents and advocates, was not necessarily a political liability, however, given that his support comes from more moderate Democrats and independents. In Mr. Biden, these voters may see a reflection of their own nuanced and sometimes conflicting views on abortion rights.\n\nIf Mr. Biden had held firm, the storm would have passed. Instead, he waffled. If this is how the Biden campaign will handle attacks on his lengthy record, the former vice-president could be in for a bumpy ride.\n\nMuch of Mr. Biden's support stems from the perception that he is a winning candidate who can stand up to - and defeat - Donald Trump. Too many fumbles, and that veneer of electability will strip away.\n\nMany among the field of 24 candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination - including Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Jay Inslee - expressed support this week for repealing the law.\n\nOn Wednesday, both Mr. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, and Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, directly criticized Mr. Biden's now-changed viewpoint.\n\nSpeaking to MSNBC during a televised town hall event, Ms. Warren said she felt Mr. Biden was wrong to support the amendment because \"it's just discrimination\" against poorer women.\n\nMr. O'Rourke told CBS News that Mr. Biden's viewpoint was \"absolutely wrong.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he does not understand,\" he said, \"who the Hyde Amendment hurts the most, lower income communities, communities of color.\"\n\nThe four female senators running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination - Ms. Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar - have co-sponsored a measure to revoke the Hyde Amendment. They also tweeted criticisms of the law this week, but did not name Mr. Biden.",
    " Title: Iran Protests Spread, US, Allies Support Anti-Government Demonstrations Amidst Tensions in Region\n\nArticle:\n\nIranian leaders' apologies over the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane last week have failed to quell the growing anti-government protests across the country. The airliner disaster occurred hours after Iran fired missiles at Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops, in retaliation for a drone strike at Baghdad airport that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.\n\nOn Sunday, eight Katyusha rockets hit Iraq's Balad Air Base, north of Baghdad, wounding four Iraqi air force officers, according to an Iraqi military statement. No American or coalition forces were at the base when the rockets struck, a U.S. military official told CNN.\n\nIn Iran, demonstrators are calling for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and for those responsible for downing the plane to be prosecuted. Protests have now spread to other cities, including Shiraz, Esfahan, Hamedan, and Orumiyeh, according to Reuters.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted his support for the demonstrators, saying his administration will \"continue to stand by you.\" Likewise, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his support for the protesters and called on European powers to increase pressure on the Iranian regime.\n\nIran previously denied U.S. claims that the country had shot down the plane before admitting the mistake on Saturday. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said his country \"deeply regrets this disastrous mistake\" and his \"thoughts and prayers go to all the mourning families.\" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif blamed the disaster on \"human error\" and \"US adventurism.\"\n\nThe protests came as Iran faces fresh criticism abroad for the temporary arrest Saturday of British Ambassador Rob Macaire. On Sunday, Macaire was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry. According to the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Macaire was arrested while in the middle of a crowd of protesters in front of Tehran's Amir Kabir University. He was accused of instigating and directing radical and destructive demonstrations, and later released.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called Macaire's arrest a \"flagrant violation of international law\" -- a sentiment echoed by the German and French foreign ministries. Iranian officials said Macaire was released as soon as his identity was confirmed.\n\nThe downed plane's victims included 57 Canadians, and the country's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a press conference Saturday that, \"what Iran has admitted to is very serious.\" \"Canada will not rest until we get the accountability, justice, and closure that the families deserve,\" Trudeau said.\n\nRouhani told Trudeau he was committed \"to collaborate, to give closure to the victims, de-escalate tensions in the region and continue this dialogue,\" the Canadian PM said. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian general prosecutor's office said in a statement it was now investigating the incident as a possible case of \"willful killing and aircraft destruction.\" The downing of the plane is being handled as a case of \"violation of traffic safety rules\" and \"operation of air transport resulting in death.\" However, prosecutors said Iran's admission changed the scope to \"liability for the willful killing of two or more people and the destruction of the aircraft.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that Iran's admission was a \"step in the right direction.\" Iranian authorities are in possession of the two flight data recorders, also known as black boxes, which Ukrainian investigators got access to on Friday. They have yet to start examining the information, but have said it included communications between the pilot and Tehran flight control.",
    " Title: President Trump Preemptively Warns Protesters Ahead of Tulsa Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signaled on Friday that protesters, \"anarchists,\" and those causing unrest will face a tougher response in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this weekend compared to Democratic-run cities across the country. In a tweet, Mr. Trump warned that protesters, \"anarchists,\" agitators, looters, or \"lowlifes\" who travel to Oklahoma for his comeback rally on Saturday night will not be treated as they have been in cities like New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis.\n\nThe tweet did not distinguish between protesters demonstrating against racial injustice and those who have damaged property or occupied parts of cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany later clarified that the president was referring to protesters who are violent, \"anarchists,\" and looters.\n\nTulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum, a Republican, agreed not to impose a previously ordered curfew on rally attendees, according to the Trump campaign. The Oklahoma Supreme Court also denied an attempt by local plaintiffs to block the rally from taking place. In a unanimous ruling, the state court stated that the petitioners did not establish a \"clear legal right\" to cancel the rally.\n\nThe Trump campaign expects tens of thousands of people to attend the rally at the Bank of Oklahoma (BOK) Center, with the president's first rally since early March, when the coronavirus began spreading in the U.S. The campaign will check attendees' temperatures, distribute hand sanitizer, and masks at the door, though wearing masks is optional.\n\nMs. McEnany stated she does not plan to wear a mask at the rally, citing it as a personal decision and her regular testing. The president is aiming to rejuvenate the economy after societal lockdowns aimed at controlling the virus and positioning himself as a \"law and order\" candidate who will not tolerate protests turning violent.\n\nHowever, Mr. Trump continues to face criticism for his decision to stage a photo-op at St. John's Episcopal Church near the White House after police forcefully cleared mostly peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park on June 1. It remains unclear whether similar incidents will occur in Tulsa. Community organizers plan to observe the Juneteenth holiday over the weekend in the historic Greenwood district, which was known as Black Wall Street before a 1921 massacre.\n\nRoss Baker, a political professor at Rutgers University, commented, \"The president has been rattling his cage. He is desperate to break out of the physical confines of the White House and draw energy from an adoring crowd, which he is certain to get in Tulsa, where there is little chance of large counter-demonstrations.\" Mr. Baker added, \"This is all about his own morale, which has been flagging since the Lafayette Square episode.\"",
    " Title: 69-Year-Old Man Dies in Shootout with Police at Immigration Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nA 69-year-old man identified as Willem Van Spronsen was shot and killed by police early Saturday morning after he allegedly threw incendiary devices at the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Tacoma, Washington. The Tacoma Police Department responded to the privately run detention center, which holds migrants pending deportation proceedings, at approximately 4 a.m.\n\nAccording to police spokeswoman Loretta Cool, Van Spronsen caused a vehicle to catch fire and attempted to ignite a large propane tank and set buildings on fire. He was armed with a rifle, a satchel, and flares, police said. Officers called out to Van Spronsen, and shots were fired. Cool did not have specific details of what transpired, but she stated that the area is covered by surveillance cameras from the detention center. She did not know whether Van Spronsen fired at the officers.\n\nAfter the gunfire, officers took cover, contained the area, and set up medical aid a short distance away, police said. Officers then located Van Spronsen and determined he had been shot and was dead at the scene. No law enforcement officers were injured. The four Tacoma police officers who fired their weapons have been placed on paid administrative leave as is standard in officer-involved shootings.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating the incident, and questions remain about the motive behind Van Spronsen's actions. Deb Bartley, a friend of Van Spronsen's for about 20 years, told the Seattle Times that she believes he wanted to provoke a fatal conflict. Bartley described Van Spronsen as an anarchist and anti-fascist, and believes his attack on the detention center was intended to provoke a fatal conflict.\n\nVan Spronsen was accused of assaulting a police officer during a protest outside the detention center in 2018. According to court documents, he lunged at the officer and wrapped his arms around the officer's neck and shoulders, as the officer was trying to detain a 17-year-old protester. Van Spronsen pleaded guilty to the charge of obstructing police and was given a deferred sentence in October.\n\nGEO Group, which runs the 1,575-bed Northwest Detention Center, released a statement to The Associated Press, saying, \"Baseless accusations about how detainees are treated at our facilities have led to misplaced aggression and a dangerous environment for our employees, whose safety is our top priority. Violence of any kind against our employees and property will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe detention center in Tacoma has modern amenities, including air conditioning, recreational activities, a bed for every individual, and medical care available at all hours, according to GEO Group. Last year, a federal judge ruled that Washington state could pursue its lawsuit seeking to force GEO Group to pay minimum wage for work done by detainees at the detention center.\n\nIn November, a Russian asylum-seeker who conducted a hunger strike to protest the conditions at the detention center died by suicide, the Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office ruled. Mergensana Amar, 40, was taken off life support after attempting to kill himself while in voluntary protective custody at the detention center on November 15, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Defends ISIS Assessments Amidst Political Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a memo to staff obtained by Fox News, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, praised his analysts for their work in bringing attention to the Islamic State's (ISIS) gains over the past two years. This praise comes amidst a heated debate following President Obama's comments to \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend, where he suggested that the intelligence community may have underestimated the threat posed by ISIS.\n\nThe ensuing controversy has led to a round of finger-pointing, with the White House distancing itself from any intention to blame the intelligence community. However, the White House is disputing accusations from Republican lawmakers and intelligence officials that Obama ignored ISIS warnings for months.\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) told Fox News on Wednesday that lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee, on which she sits, had been warning the administration for years about the seriousness of the ISIS threat.\n\nIn the memo to staff sent Tuesday, Clapper made clear that his officers have been monitoring, assessing, and drawing attention to the expansion of ISIS for a while. He wrote, \"I'm proud of the [intelligence community's] efforts over the past two years to monitor, assess, and call attention to the expansion of ISIL, and I know the president has found that work to be critical to developing his strategy.\"\n\nClapper noted that both he and Obama were on the same page in saying it was difficult to predict the \"will\" of Iraqi security forces to fight. He wrote, \"Despite all we understood about the capabilities of ISIL and the Iraqi Security Forces, we have no intelligence tool that could have predicted the ISF's sudden collapse in northern Iraq and the resultant ease with which ISIL forces captured territory.\"\n\nClapper's claims about how their analysts have been drawing attention to ISIS for the past two years could fuel concerns that the White House was not taking those assessments seriously enough. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) has faulted \"policy makers\" for not confronting the threat.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday about Clapper's role, Rogers suggested Obama missed key briefings, telling Fox News, \"James Clapper has a tough job overseeing 16 intel agencies. I am more concerned about the president and the missed intel briefings.\"\n\nIntelligence officials have told Fox News and other outlets that they were drawing attention for months to the ISIS threat but were ignored by the White House. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest pointed to Clapper's memo to rebut one anonymous quote to that effect in The New York Times.\n\n\"He put out a message to the intelligence community that directly contradicts the anonymous individual who's quoted in the New York Times,\" Earnest said, reading passages from Clapper's memo and saying the memo was \"consistent\" with Obama's comments on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nClapper previously had admitted that U.S. analysts both underestimated the Islamic State and \"overestimated\" the ability of the Iraqi army to fight them. However, the memo on Tuesday did not acknowledge underestimating ISIS, as Obama said on \"60 Minutes.\"",
    " Title: Obama to Warn Iran of Consequences Over Nuclear Weapons, Address UN General Assembly\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will deliver a stern warning to Iran on Tuesday, stating that the United States will take necessary actions to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The warning comes as part of Obama's address to the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly this week.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the president will emphasize the need for a united front against further attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in Muslim countries. In his address, Obama is expected to say:\n\n\"America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty. That is why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian government accountable. And that is why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nIn addition to addressing the Iranian nuclear issue, Obama is also expected to pay tribute to Ambassador Chris Stevens, who died after a Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nObama's address comes as the U.S. presidential campaign heads towards its finish. Republican rival Mitt Romney has criticized Obama's foreign affairs leadership in the lead-up to the president's speech.\n\nBoth Obama and Romney are scheduled to address the Clinton Global Initiative today. The U.N. webcasts its proceedings, and updates will be posted as the president and other leaders address the assembly.\n\nNotably, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are also scheduled to speak at the General Assembly, on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.",
    " Title: International Community Rallies to Aid in Search for Abducted Nigerian Schoolgirls\n\nArticle:\n\nThe international community is rallying to aid in the search for 276 schoolgirls abducted by the militant group Boko Haram in Nigeria on April 14. The girls were taken from the Government Girls Secondary School in rural Chibok, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Maiduguri and some 600 miles from the capital of Abuja.\n\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria has vowed that Boko Haram's abduction of the schoolgirls will be the terror group's undoing. He made the statement at the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting in Nigeria's capital city of Abuja. Jonathan acknowledged offers of help from the United States, Britain, China, and France, all of which have offered help in the weeks-old search for the girls.\n\nHowever, the task of recovering the girls appears to have grown more complicated with news that U.S. intelligence believes the girls have been split up. U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, stated that they think the girls have been broken up into smaller groups. He declined to detail how U.S. officials came to this conclusion.\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the U.N.'s special envoy for global education, told CNN that the search must be expanded to Niger, Cameroon, and Chad to find information that could lead to the girls. Brown emphasized the importance of using the information to find the girls before they are dispersed across Africa, which is a very real possibility.\n\nThe girls have not been seen since their abduction, and on Sunday night, another kidnapping occurred in the village of Warabe, with villagers accusing Boko Haram militants of taking at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15.\n\nBoko Haram, which translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the local Hausa language, has been known to kill Muslim clerics who dare criticize them. The United States has branded Boko Haram a terror organization and has put a $7 million bounty on its leader, Abubakar Shekau. Nigerian police also announced a reward of about $310,000 for information leading to the girls' rescue.\n\nThe Nigerian government has been under fire for its response to the abduction, with many criticizing government officials for failing to take action in the hours and days following the girls' abduction. Jonathan, who waited three weeks before speaking to the nation on the matter, and his security ministers have defended the response, saying efforts were underway but could not be disclosed publicly.\n\nThe United States is sending a team of law enforcement experts and military advisers to Nigeria to support the Nigerian efforts to rescue the girls. France said Thursday that it would send a \"specialized team\" to help. The British government is also sending a small team, according to Prime Minister David Cameron's office. Neither country said exactly what expertise their teams would bring. British satellites and advanced tracking capabilities will also be used, and China has promised to provide any intelligence gathered by its satellite network, according to the Nigerian government.\n\nSeven members of the U.S. military are scheduled to arrive in Nigeria on Friday to join a team of advisers supporting the Nigerian efforts to rescue the girls. There are no plans to send U.S. combat troops, according to Kirby. Nigeria's top security officials have appealed to the public for help during a visit to the Chibok school on Thursday, according to a statement released by Nigeria's director of defense information. The chief of defense, Air Marshal Alex S. Badeh, called on members of the immediate community to provide security agencies with useful information that will lead to the rescue of the girls.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders and President Trump Fail to Reach Agreement on Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A meeting between U.S. congressional leaders and President Donald Trump on Wednesday failed to produce an agreement to end the 12-day partial government shutdown, with the president insisting on $5 billion in funding for a border wall and Democrats opposing the demand. Congressional leaders are expected to return to the White House on Friday, signaling the shutdown will likely continue into the weekend.\n\nThe White House convened the meeting to try to convince Democrats that funding a wall on the southern border with Mexico was a pressing security need. Instead, Democratic leaders cut off Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's presentation and tried to press Trump to accept their offer.\n\n\"It just was not a credible presentation,\" Senator Dick Durbin said of the briefing. He added that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be elected House speaker on Thursday, insisted the conversation focus instead on the shutdown.\n\nPelosi said the House would proceed with plans to hold votes on Thursday, when they formally take control of the chamber from Trump's fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing the wall money sought by Trump.\n\n\"We're asking the president to open up government,\" Pelosi told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward on the Senate floor that the chamber would not vote on the legislation, calling it a \"political sideshow\" and \"total nonstarter.\"\n\nDemocrats say they want to fund most of the government through September, but allow for another month to negotiate wall funding by only partially funding the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the wall. Schumer said Trump conceded that Republicans would lose leverage if they allowed the rest of the government to be funded.\n\n\"We asked him to give us one good reason... why you should continue your shutdown of the eight Cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security. He could not give a good answer,\" Schumer told reporters after the meeting.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday evening, Trump called the meeting \"important\" and said he would continue talks with Democrats \"to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.\"\n\nTrump's demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers. Before meeting with lawmakers, Trump said the shutdown would last for \"as long as it takes\" as he pushes for wall money as part of any legislation to reopen agencies shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec. 22.\n\n\"It could be a long time, or it could be quickly,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting.\n\n\"We know that we have a challenge along the border,\" said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican. \"We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well.\"\n\nPelosi noted that the legislation being presented in the House had previously won backing in the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands in the new 2019-2020 Congress that convenes on Thursday.\n\nBut McConnell said previously that Senate Republicans would not approve a spending measure Trump does not support.\n\nTrump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats, Trump called the border a \"sieve,\" rebutted Pelosi's complaint that a wall was immoral, provided an estimate of the U.S. illegal immigrant population far higher than the figures most experts cite and made disputed comments about progress toward building a wall.\n\nThe visit by Pelosi and Schumer was their first to the White House since their sharp exchange with Trump in the Oval Office on Dec. 11 during which the president told them he would be \"proud to shut down the government for border security.\"\n\nThe $5 billion Trump is seeking would cover only a portion of the money needed for a border wall, a project estimated to cost about $23 billion. Trump had said Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico has refused.",
    " Title: West Point Graduation Ceremony Held In-Person Despite COVID-19 Outbreak, 1.5% of Graduates Test Positive\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Military Academy at West Point did not require an in-person graduation ceremony this year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, President Donald Trump insisted on delivering an in-person commencement address to the 1,000-person graduating class on June 13, prompting Army leaders to alter their plans and summon cadets back to campus.\n\nOn Monday, the Army announced that 1.5% of the returning graduates, approximately 15 or 16 students, had tested positive for COVID-19. Army spokesperson Emanuel L. Ortiz stated in an emailed statement, \"This was anticipated. None were symptomatic, and no cadet has contracted through person-to-person contact while under the Army's care.\"\n\nThe decision to hold an in-person ceremony, despite the ongoing pandemic, has been met with criticism. In March, as West Point leaders discussed whether to return students currently on spring break to campus, Trump announced his intention to attend the ceremony. The New York Times reported that academy officials were taken aback by the impromptu announcement and were forced to improvise after Trump \"preempted their planning.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper addressed Naval Academy graduates virtually last month, and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a socially-distanced Air Force Academy commencement event with no spectators. Trump is expected to deliver a more pageantry-filled speech at West Point, the only service academy he has not yet addressed as commencement speaker.\n\nLt. Gen. Darryl Williams, the academy's superintendent, told reporters that returning cadets will be \"segregated the entire time\" into five cohorts, and no cohort will intermingle for 14 days. \"They'll eat separately, they'll live separately,\" he said.\n\nThe Army has struggled to justify Trump's decision, which requires hundreds of future soldiers to return to a region of the country that has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus. Ryan McCarthy, the Army's top civilian leader, said cadets would have needed to return to campus anyway \"to begin the process of the physicals they need, to take all of their clearance procedures, to clear barracks, get their personal items.\" However, that process could have been spaced out in a way that would have ensured greater safety for cadets.\n\nEven academy alumni and parents were reportedly stunned by the decision. \"There is no military need to do this,\" Jason Fritz, a 2002 West Point graduate, told the Washington Post. \"This is a logistics nightmare, all just so the president has an audience to give a speech he wants to give.\"\n\nThe commencement speech has sparked an uproar on the West Point Parents Facebook group, where most posts tend to be anodyne calls for support for cadets and the Army. In a thread announcing Trump as the graduation speaker that appeared in April, when the decision was announced, several posters blasted the decision as both narcissistic and dangerous. \"PLEASE PLEASE do not let your children go back for graduation. It's not worth their health or yours,\" one person wrote. But others contextualized Trump's mandate by comparing it to a typical order from a commander in chief, including ones that send cadets off to war. \"For those who have not yet done so, use this time of social distancing to come to terms with the choice our children have made,\" another parent suggested, \"and realize that this choice will likely put them in harm's way in some way, shape or form.\"",
    " Title: Reddit Quarantines 'european' Subreddit, Sparking Debate on Free Speech and Censorship\n\nArticle:\n\nAdministrators at the popular online forum Reddit have quarantined a subreddit titled 'european', sparking a debate on free speech and censorship. Subreddits, or communities dedicated to specific topics, function as forums for users to discuss various subjects.\n\nThe quarantine of the 'european' subreddit occurred on May 12, 2016, as stated in a note on the subreddit's link. The note reads, \"The administration has decided to censor free speech for Europeans and they quarantined the subreddit.\" The subreddit has been set to private, and the note adds that \"You must be a moderator or approved submitter to visit.\" Visitors were also urged to continue their discussions on Voat, another online forum.\n\nRecent allegations of bias in social media have come to the forefront, with the Reddit accusation following closely on the heels of anonymous claims that contractors at Facebook deliberately suppressed conservative news on the site's Trending Topics section. Facebook has denied any political bias, stating there is \"no evidence\" of the alleged activity.\n\nReddit stated that the 'european' subreddit violated the forum's content policy. In an emailed statement to FoxNews.com, Reddit explained, \"Quarantines on Reddit are rare - there are thousands of vibrant conversations flourishing on the site every day.\" The statement continued, \"Subreddits are quarantined only when the content is clearly offensive to the broader Reddit community.\"\n\nQuarantining aims to prevent the content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not wish to do so. \"A subreddit is quarantined when there are concerns that its content is extreme and could be offensive to people outside of that community,\" explained Reddit. \"The quarantine process doesn\u2019t end the conversation; it adds an opt-in measure so that people have the choice to join the conversation,\" it added.\n\nRestrictions on a quarantined subreddit include requiring an explicit opt-in, requiring an account with a verified email address, no use of custom images, and the removal of revenue generation.\n\nThe 'european' quarantining has prompted a mixed reaction elsewhere on Reddit. Some users claim that racist views were expressed on the subreddit, while others argue that it hosted a range of opinions and emphasize the importance of open dialogue.\n\nReddit, which had over 277 million unique visitors last month, uses teams of volunteers to moderate subreddits. The forum updated its content policy last year, consolidating multiple rules and policies into a single set of guidelines.\n\nA blogger with an interest in numbers, who uses the name Curious Gnu, recently analyzed a Reddit dataset of 4.6 million comments and noted that 78 percent of Reddit threads with over 1,000 comments mention Nazis or Hitler. The blogger found that around 2.6 percent of comments in the 'european' subreddit mentioned Nazis or Hitler, a slightly higher percentage compared to the 'AskHistorians' and 'history' subreddits, which had around 2.75 percent and 2.7 percent of comments referencing the topics, respectively.\n\nRelated: Reddit updates content policy, bans a 'handful' of groups that exist'solely to annoy' others; No censorship in Chinese Internet, says China's top censor.",
    " Title: Justice Department Increases Investigations into Classified Information Leaks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department has 27 ongoing investigations into leaks of classified information with a \"political motive,\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed Tuesday during his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. This number is three times more than the agency had in the three years prior.\n\n\"Leaks have reached epidemic proportions,\" Sessions said. \"We have 27 ongoing investigations, some of those involve leaks before President Trump took office, and some after.\"\n\nSessions added that before this year, it was only three per year\u2014there were nine. He also stated that Reality Winner, a former National Security Agency contractor, had been charged for leaking classified information.\n\nWinner is accused of leaking a classified intelligence report containing \"Top Secret Level\" information. The report, according to the Justice Department, contained classified defense information from an intelligence community agency. Winner was an avid supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.\n\nIn July, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released a report that revealed the Trump administration was facing an \"alarming\" and \"unprecedented\" cascade of media leaks that posed a potential danger to national security. The report estimated that the administration has dealt with roughly one leak per day.\n\nThe report stated that leaks flowed about \"seven times faster\" under the Trump administration than during the first 126 days of both Obama's and George W. Bush's presidencies.",
    " Title: US Designates North Korea as State Sponsor of Terrorism, Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, a move that escalates tensions between the two nations. President Donald Trump announced the decision during a Cabinet meeting on Monday, stating, \"Should have happened a long time ago.\" The administration will reveal new sanctions against North Korea on Tuesday.\n\nThe designation places North Korea alongside Iran, Sudan, and Syria as the only countries on the state sponsors of terrorism list. The designation bars them from receiving US development assistance, bans defense sales to them, restricts exports of items that could potentially be used for military purposes, and also places tougher financial restrictions on them, according to the State Department.\n\nHowever, the actual support for terrorism by North Korea, the reason for placing a country on the list, is debatable. Administration lawyers noted that North Korea had to commit more than one act of terrorism to warrant placement on the list. The Trump administration officials assert that the February assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's estranged half-brother in Malaysia was an act of terrorism.\n\nThere is no agreement within the administration as to whether the brutal death of Otto Warmbier, a 23-year-old US citizen released by North Korea this summer who returned home in a coma, constituted terrorism.\n\nNorth Korea was previously on the state sponsor of terror list but was removed during talks designed to get the country to stop its nuclear program under President George W. Bush. However, North Korea tested a missile capable of hitting most of the US on July 28, and Trump's move can be seen as a return to a previous policy.\n\nIt is unlikely that this designation will stop North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea has no interest in giving up its nuclear program and is already heavily sanctioned by the US, China, and Europe. The Trump administration continues to ask China to put even more pressure on North Korea, especially since China accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea's trade. China recently sent an envoy to North Korea this month, a development Trump called a \"big move\" on Twitter.",
    " Title: Green Party Candidate Jill Stein's Recount Effort and Governor McCrory's Fraud Allegations in North Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nGreen Party candidate Jill Stein has raised over $4 million in three days for a recount in three critical Rust Belt states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The recount is in response to what Stein called a \"hack-riddled election.\" Meanwhile, Republican Governor Pat McCrory of North Carolina has refused to concede a loss in the state, claiming fraudulent votes gave his opponent, Attorney General Roy Cooper, the win on Election Day.\n\nExperts suggest that both candidates' gambits are unlikely to change the election outcome, given the scant evidence to support the fraud claims. The divisive nature of the 2016 election, as evidenced by these actions, highlights the need for increased confidence in the electoral system, according to some election experts.\n\nJ. Alex Halderman, director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, has suggested that regular auditing of voting machines could provide safeguards against hackers and improve voter peace of mind. Halderman has demonstrated that some American voting machines can be hacked.\n\nStein's recount effort has been fueled in part by disgruntled Hillary Clinton voters, eager to blame conspiracy rather than voter sentiment for Clinton's Election Day loss to Donald Trump. Concerns were raised by a team of researchers, including Halderman, which found discrepancies in some key Wisconsin counties won by Trump. However, the Clinton campaign has remained silent on Stein's recount gambit.\n\nIn North Carolina, Governor McCrory is facing headwinds in his allegations of a broader voter conspiracy that put Cooper over the top. McCrory, who is more than 7,000 votes behind, is demanding a recount. Preliminary analyses suggest that at least one list of supposedly fraudulent voters was largely wrong, with most of the names listed as ineligible found to be valid voters. County election boards, run by Republicans, have also found little evidence of voter wrongdoing.\n\nThe willingness to invoke the potential of fraud has, to some extent, dovetailed with emerging cyberthreats to ring fresh alarm bells about the US voting system. At the very least, recent hacks of the Democratic Party and state voter registration systems suggest that those keen to disrupt the US system are probing its defenses.\n\nReforms suggested to improve the integrity of elections include bolder safeguards against insider wrongdoing, more federal funding to upgrade aging voting machines, and, critically, automatic paper-trail audits. About 70 percent of US voting machines leave a paper trail, but randomized checks are done only upon request.\n\n\"It is vital that we protect voters from the real threats to the integrity of elections,\" Myrna Perez, a law professor at the New York University School of Law, wrote in a Brennan Center report from earlier this year. \"Fortunately, it is possible to protect election integrity without disenfranchising eligible voters.\"",
    " Title: Trump and Pence Seek Momentum in Second Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming second presidential debate on Sunday, Donald Trump is aiming to build on the momentum created by his running mate, Mike Pence, following the latter's perceived victory in the sole vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Pence's performance has been widely praised for outperforming his Democratic counterpart, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, during the vice presidential debate.\n\nThe vice presidential debate has come as a breath of fresh air for Trump, who has faced a series of setbacks, including an ineffective debate performance, a public feud with a former Miss Universe, damaging tax revelations, and a steady decline in opinion polls.\n\nAt a rally in Henderson, Nevada, on Wednesday, Trump praised Pence, stating, \"Mike Pence did an incredible job. I'm getting a lot of credit because that's really my first so-called choice; that's really my first hire, as we would say in Las Vegas.\"\n\nThe apparent success of Pence in the vice presidential debate is unlikely to significantly alter the course of the race, as vice presidential debates typically have minimal impact. However, the stakes are high, as Trump prepares to face Hillary Clinton in St. Louis on October 9.\n\nTobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor specializing in political communications, commented, \"How many times have all the pundits been interviewed saying, 'Trump is finally finished'? That must have happened 10 times. The problem now is the clock is running down. We'll be at four weeks, three weeks, two weeks. Can he pull the rabbit out of the hat one more time?\"\n\nWith the second debate now of increased importance, there are reports that the Trump team is taking a more focused approach to debate preparations. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, an early Trump supporter and skilled debater, is said to be involved in the debate preparations.\n\nHowever, some Republicans are skeptical about the extent to which Trump can make up ground at this stage. GOP strategist and Hill contributor Matt Mackowiak stated, \"Now it's up to him. It's like coaching versus playing. Coaches can prepare you and they can have the right play calls. But at the end of the day, the player on the field has to go do it. So far, Trump has fallen short. He really needs to win decisively on Sunday.\"\n\nNumerous recent polls have shown the scale of the challenge Trump faces. On Wednesday, a new poll from Monmouth University showed him trailing Clinton by 2 percentage points in Ohio, a historically favorable battleground state for the GOP nominee. Another new survey, from WRAL-TV and Survey USA, showed Trump trailing in North Carolina by 2 points. A national poll from Reuters/IPSOS gave Clinton a 6-point edge.\n\nThe data forecasting site FiveThirtyEight gave Clinton a 76.2 percent chance of prevailing in its \"poll-only\" forecast as of Wednesday evening, her highest rating by that measure since late August. However, the polls of the race have swung wildly before.\n\nClinton has twice led the RealClearPolitics national polling average by more than 6 points\u2014in mid-June and early August\u2014only to have Trump narrow those leads down to virtually nothing. Some Clinton critics maintain that she could yet be pushed off track by an external event, such as an unforced error or damaging disclosures from an organization such as WikiLeaks, which published embarrassing emails between Democratic National Committee staffers as the party's convention began this summer in Philadelphia.\n\nA WikiLeaks news conference earlier this week failed to live up to the hype that surrounded it, casting doubt on whether the organization can follow through on its threats. Republicans also warn that Trump and his supporters cannot depend on a lucky break. The nominee himself, they say, needs to wrest back the initiative from Clinton.\n\n\"Hope is not a strategy,\" said Mackowiak. \"More of the same is not going to change the trajectory of the race. He needs to demonstrate at this next debate that he is prepared to be president\u2014and that he can force Hillary Clinton back on defense.\"\n\nIn 2012, President Obama gave a lackluster performance at his opening clash with GOP nominee Mitt Romney and fell sharply in the polls afterward. However, Vice President Biden acquitted himself well against Romney's running mate, future Speaker Paul Ryan, and Obama was much improved when he met Romney a second and third time.\n\nSunday's debate will be in a town-hall format, but there is no consensus among insiders as to whether that helps or hinders Trump. Some backers suggest it will make it easier for Trump to feed off the energy of the crowd. Skeptics counter that televised town halls are technically challenging, in terms of tone and body language, and that a small, mostly quiet audience creates a very different atmosphere from the rambunctious rallies where Trump thrives.\n\nHowever, if Trump surpasses expectations and narrows Clinton's lead one more time, he would be hailed as the \"turnaround master of the decade.\" As Tobe Berkovitz put it, \"He would be the turnaround master of the decade if he pulls that off.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Clemency Grants to Military Figures Sparks Controversy Over Military Discipline\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has granted clemency to three military figures embroiled in war crimes charges, a move that has sparked controversy and criticism from both sides. The Defense Secretary, Mark Esper, on Sunday fired the Navy's top official, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, over allegations that Spencer proposed a deal with the White House behind Esper's back to resolve the case of Eddie Gallagher.\n\nThe pardons have been met with criticism from various quarters, with critics arguing that they undermine military discipline and send a message that U.S. forces will be allowed to get away with anything. The actions of the pardoned individuals, according to critics, qualify as war crimes.\n\nCritics argue that the president has misused his power to give war criminals a free pass. Interfering in the process before one of these cases went to trial was wrong, and overruling the punishment meted out in the other two cases was even worse. The actions of the president, according to critics, undermine military discipline and send a horrible message that U.S. forces will be allowed to get away with anything.\n\nSupporters of the president argue that the president has the power to pardon and that he is righting a wrong. They argue that the president should use his power more often in cases where guilt or a fair trial is in genuine doubt. However, they acknowledge that the use of this power comes with a cost, in this case, injury to the morality of a nation that once held its own to account.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the president's role in military personnel decisions. Traditionally, presidents do not micromanage military personnel decisions at this level, and it is seen as bad for morale and can prove disruptive to the chain of command. The SEAL team, which has been shaken by a series of scandals in recent years, has been left to conduct its business in accordance with the rules.\n\nIn conclusion, the president's interventions in the cases of military figures undercut military leadership and dishonor the men and women who serve their country while upholding its values. The damage is compounding, with the commander in chief's corrupting influence ever widening. The president's actions have undermined principles that long have served as a bedrock for the armed forces, and by sanctioning illegal behavior, the president endangers the safety of our troops, giving our adversaries a green light to similarly mistreat men and women who serve honorably in our military.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Oppose Motion to Dismiss Impeachment Charges Against Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Republican members of the U.S. Senate have expressed opposition to any attempt to dismiss the impeachment charges against President Donald Trump without a trial. The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives is expected to formally send the charges to the Senate this week.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has vowed to help acquit his fellow Republican. Trump appeared to reverse his position on how the Senate should proceed, writing on Twitter that a full trial would give the Democrats who pursued impeachment undeserved credibility and signaling support for dismissal of the charges with no trial.\n\nHowever, Republican Senator Roy Blunt stated on Monday that there is \"almost no interest\" among Republican senators for a motion to dismiss the House charges. Republican Senator Mitt Romney also expressed opposition, stating, \"At this stage, the allegations that have been made are serious and deserve to be given consideration with the arguments for and against.\"\n\nSenator Susan Collins, among a handful of Republicans whom Democrats hope to persuade to back their call for witness testimony, told reporters that she and a small group of colleagues were discussing a trial format that would allow lawmakers to vote on whether to include witnesses after hearing from each side and having the opportunity to pose questions.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi delayed sending the two articles of impeachment passed by the House on Dec. 18 to the Republican-led Senate, preventing McConnell from holding a quick trial right away that cleared the president. The House charged Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The impeachment charges stem from Trump's request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the Nov. 3 presidential election.\n\nHouse Democrats will discuss on Tuesday how to move forward, with the chamber possibly voting to send the charges to the Senate later that day. Pelosi stated that the delay was meant to convince the U.S. public of the need to call witnesses in the Senate trial after Trump's administration blocked some current and former officials from cooperating in the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nMcConnell has yet to say definitively how the Senate will conduct the trial. He has not committed to allowing any witnesses or new documents in the proceedings and instead could steer the process toward a quick acquittal. McConnell has left open the possibility of deciding on witness testimony later in the trial. He has said he sees no chance of the Senate convicting Trump.\n\nThe Senate, which could open a trial rapidly after receiving the charges from the House, plans to meet daily except on Sundays each week to conduct the proceedings, likely beginning each day at noon EST (1700 GMT) and working until either 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. EST (2200 or 2300 GMT), according to congressional aides. The Senate is expected to vote to acquit Trump even though some moderate Republicans have bristled over McConnell's reflexive support for the president. Conviction and removal of Trump would require a two-thirds majority of those present in the 100-member chamber.",

You could say that about any campaign.\"\n\n As for her next move in politics, Clinton is getting involved with political action organizations such as \"Onward Together,\" which she founded this month.\n\n \"I'm not going anywhere,\" she said. \"I have a big stake in what's happening to this country.\"",
    " Title: Google Prioritizes Relevant and High-Quality Content Over Political Ideology, but Resource Disparities Affect Rankings\n\nArticle:\n\nGoogle has stated that it is optimizing its search engine to prioritize relevant answers and high-quality content, rather than political ideology. However, the distribution of relevance and quality across the media may not be equal, leading to potential disparities in rankings.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider some markers of relevance (timeliness, impact, keyword density) and quality (originality, sourcing, depth). Applying a ranking algorithm to mainstream media, which includes large networks, newspapers, and digital sites that adhere to traditional journalistic values, would result in higher rankings due to their larger staffs, better-trained journalists, and deeper roots in the field.\n\nFor instance, The New York Times and The Washington Post have thousands of journalists combined, and The Times' subscription revenue surpassed a billion dollars last year. In contrast, many right-wing outlets are embedded within advocacy groups, such as The Daily Signal from the Heritage Foundation, or are small blogs without the human resources for original reporting. For example, HotAir, an outlet cited by Bolyard, has four editors (one of whom is pseudonymous), and The Blaze, another outlet Bolyard cited, is reportedly down to fewer than 50 employees. The Weekly Standard, another right-wing media organization, appears to have an editorial staff of only 35.\n\nSome right-wing media organizations do not adhere to the standards of journalism recognized by the mainstream media, peddling conspiracy theories or engaging in ethically questionable reporting practices. Similarly, left-leaning outlets like Salon and DailyKos should not expect to compete with The New York Times on Google placement due to resource disparities.\n\nGoogle's concept of relevance is caught in a loop between what people want and what they think it provides. Google sees pages as relevant if people engage with them, but people trust Google to serve up relevant content, so they engage with what Google shows them. Defining quality among journalism experts is challenging, and Google has had a difficult time defining what journalistic value means in machine-readable terms.\n\nWhile some aspects of quality can be measured (e.g., the number of fresh quotes in a story from new sources, the number of links to other high-quality sites, the amount of time readers spend with a story, or the variety of readers engaging with a story), these indicators are not foolproof, and the algorithm will rank many great stories poorly. The system can, to a limited extent, be gamed, and it is far from perfect.",
    " Title: Guide to Investigating Local Police Activities for Community Change\n\nArticle:\n\nProtests against racism and police violence are taking place in cities across America, but the issue extends beyond urban areas. As a resident, you can contribute to the change you desire in your local community. One of the initial steps is educating yourself about the activities of your local police department.\n\nBefore embarking on this journey, it's essential to consider the efforts already being made by local black-led activist groups. Engage with these groups to learn about their activities and determine how you can offer support. Avoid duplicating efforts to ensure maximum impact.\n\nTo gather information and build support for reforms, such as abolishing the police, defunding the police, or requesting minor changes, it's crucial to investigate the actions of the police in your community. Investigative reporter Andrew Ford, in a guide provided by ProPublica, offers insights into this process, emphasizing that anyone can ask questions and make public records requests, regardless of employment at a media outlet.\n\nTo begin, familiarize yourself with the laws and policies that govern police operations in your area.

    " Title: U.S. Deploys F-22 Fighter Jets to South Korea for Joint Military Exercises Amid North Korea's War Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has sent two F-22 stealth fighter jets to South Korea to participate in joint military exercises following North Korea's declaration that the Korean Peninsula is in a \"state of war.\" The F-22 Raptors were deployed to Osan Air Base in South Korea from Japan on Sunday to support ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills, according to a Pentagon spokesman.\n\nGeorge Little, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Monday that the exercise, known as Foal Eagle, is part of the air component of the drills. The U.S. military in South Korea urged North Korea to restrain itself in a statement released Sunday, stating that \"provocations will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia.\"\n\nMeanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un convened legislators Monday for an annual spring parliamentary session following a ruling party declaration that nuclear bomb building and a stronger economy are the nation's top priorities. The meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly follows near-daily threats from Pyongyang, including vows of nuclear strikes on South Korea and the U.S.\n\nNorth Korea also threatened to shut down a border factory complex that is the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, according to the Associated Press. The threats are seen as part of an effort to provoke the new government in Seoul to change its policies toward Pyongyang and to win diplomatic talks with Washington in order to gain more aid.\n\nThe White House stated that the U.S. is taking North Korea's threats seriously but has also noted Pyongyang's history of \"bellicose rhetoric.\" On Thursday, U.S. military officials revealed that two B-2 stealth bombers dropped dummy munitions on an uninhabited South Korean island as part of annual defense drills that Pyongyang sees as rehearsals for invasion. Hours later, Kim ordered his generals to put rockets on standby and threatened to strike American targets if provoked.\n\nMilitary analysts have said a full-scale conflict between North and South Korea is extremely unlikely, noting that the Korean Peninsula has remained in a technical state of war for 60 years. However, the North's continued threats toward South Korea and the United States have raised concerns that a misjudgment between the sides could lead to a clash.\n\nIn addition to the military exercise, the U.S. will fortify its defenses against a potential North Korean missile attack by adding more than a dozen missile interceptors to the 26 already in place at Fort Greely, Alaska, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has also announced.",
    " Title: Apple Unveils Apple Pay, Apple Watch, and HealthKit Amid Privacy Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nApple, the tech giant, has launched new products focused on mobile payments and health and fitness, with an emphasis on security and privacy. The products, unveiled a week after the nude celebrity photo hack, include Apple Pay, a mobile payment system, the Apple Watch, and HealthKit, an application framework open to third-party developers.\n\nApple Pay, introduced by Apple CEO Tim Cook, aims to revolutionize the credit card system with a system that allows users to complete transactions by holding their phone up to a retail sensor and using the Touch ID for authentication. The company emphasizes the security of the system, stating that it does not store credit card numbers, collect any retail transaction information, or share data with anyone.\n\nThe Apple Watch, which comes in three styles and various colors, features sensors that allow consumers to monitor their physical activity, including walking and running on flat and elevated surfaces. The device can also detect heartbeats and set fitness goals and rewards. Jony Ive, Apple's lead designer, stated, \"You can share something as personal as your own heartbeat.\"\n\nHealthKit, when combined with the Apple Watch, raises privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of medical information. The HealthKit app will allow consumers to wear their health and fitness information on their sleeves with the new Apple Watch. In response to the celebrity hacking scandal, Apple announced new guidelines for HealthKit developers, prohibiting them from storing information in iCloud.\n\nApple is not the first company in the mHealth space, but aims to differentiate itself by prioritizing privacy and security. Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology, stated, \"eHealth is going to be huge; $2.7 trillion of the American economy is spent on health care and hundreds of billions on health IT, and Apple wants a piece of that.\" Apple's new products are part of the company's efforts to redefine the market for \"wearables\" and potentially integrate these devices into the U.S. health care system.",
    " Title: Ferguson Faces Unrest: Businesses Destroyed, Police Tactics Questioned\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Monday's episodes of violence in Ferguson, Missouri, along South Florissant Road, Rob Chabot, the owner of Mobile Eye Care Solutions, expressed dismay, stating, \"They abandoned us completely.\" Chabot questioned the purpose of the state's response, saying, \"For what cause? I don't know.\"\n\nDuring a news conference, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III also criticized the state's response. He noted, \"Unfortunately, as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed, the National Guard was not deployed in enough time to save all of our businesses.\"\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the police reported 21 fires in and around Ferguson, at least 150 gunshots, and damage to 10 police cruisers. In some instances, firefighters were forced to retreat from fighting fires due to gunfire and objects being thrown.\n\nThe law enforcement's response has been questioned, with some criticizing their approach as too tame, while others defend it as necessary to de-escalate the situation. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and other officials defended their response, stating that they took steps to de-escalate the situation but that the magnitude of the violence was beyond their control.\n\nChief Belmar explained that the initial, hands-off tactics by the police were intended to allow protesters to demonstrate peacefully. However, he added that the situation ultimately grew so unstable that it required a more forceful approach.\n\nBelmar stated, \"I don't think we were underprepared, but I'll be honest with you, unless we bring 10,000 policemen in here, I don't think we can prevent folks that really are intent on destroying a community.\" However, he admitted that despite months of preparation and training, and a buildup of manpower, equipment, and technology, he had not foreseen the chaos that ultimately unfolded.\n\nAmong the more than 60 people arrested on various charges including second-degree burglary and arson, most were Missouri residents, marking a shift, some noted, from the unrest of the summer.",
    " Title: FTC Issues Information Requests to Tech Giants Over Small Mergers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued special orders to five major tech companies - Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, and Microsoft Corp - to provide information on mergers that were too small to report to antitrust regulators, the FTC announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe requests come as the Justice Department, the FTC, state attorneys general, and the House Judiciary Committee are all investigating the big tech platforms for potential anti-competitive behavior. The tech companies are accused of using their market dominance to protect their market share or to expand into adjacent markets.\n\nFTC Chairman Joe Simons declined to rule out an enforcement action based on the results of the study, stating, \"All options are on the table.\" The tech giants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe agency asked for information about deals that were done between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. The orders require each company to identify transactions that were too small to report to the FTC and the Department of Justice, which assess mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law.\n\n\"The commission plans to use the information obtained in this study to examine trends in acquisitions and the structure of deals, including whether acquisitions not subject to (antitrust) notification might have raised competitive concerns,\" the statement said.\n\nThe tech giants have faced criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Republicans have expressed concerns about what they perceive as a stifling of conservative voices on social media, while Democrats have expressed concerns about increasing consolidation.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, has explicitly called for federal regulators to undo \"ant-competitive mergers,\" including Amazon's purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's acquisitions of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.\n\nAlphabet spent $1 billion on an unspecified number of small acquisitions in 2019, according to securities filings. Many of these were companies working on artificial intelligence research and cloud computing services, areas in which Google is trying to innovate quickly and has sought to bolster hiring.\n\nApple has mostly made small deals valued at less than $500 million over the past decade, acquiring small companies working on key technologies such as augmented reality displays, camera sensors, and artificial intelligence software.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Microsoft made 19 small acquisitions for a total of $1.6 billion, mostly in cash. Microsoft has sought to consolidate its position in the business software market, with major acquisitions such as the LinkedIn social network for business professionals and the code repository site GitHub. Since acquiring LinkedIn - which also fielded rival offers from Microsoft's competitor Salesforce Inc - Microsoft has begun integrating LinkedIn's social network data with Microsoft products such as its Outlook email program.",
    " Title: US Vice President Reaffirms U.S. Commitment to Baltic States' Security Amidst Tensions with Russia\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence has reiterated the United States' commitment to the security of the Baltic states in the face of potential aggression from Russia. During a visit to Estonia, Pence labeled Russia as the region's biggest security threat, stating, \"An attack on one of us is an attack on us all.\"\n\nThe remarks were made during a meeting with NATO allies, emphasizing the mutual defense principle of the alliance. The Baltic states - Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia - gained independence following the breakup of the Soviet Union and have grown increasingly cautious of Russia since it annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.\n\nRecent tensions between the U.S. and Russia have escalated as a result of new U.S. sanctions against Russia, prompting a retaliatory move by Moscow to reduce the number of U.S. diplomatic staff. The vice president's visit to Estonia follows President Donald Trump's reaffirmation of the U.S.'s commitment to the mutual defense principle during a Washington press conference in June and a speech in Poland in early July.\n\nIn Tallinn, Pence stated, \"Under President Donald Trump, the United States stands firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense.\" He also emphasized the importance of a strong and united NATO, stating, \"A strong and united NATO is more necessary today than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter-century ago.\"\n\nRussia is set to hold large-scale military exercises with its ally Belarus in the coming month. Additionally, the U.S. is currently holding its largest-ever joint military exercises with Georgia, a country that fought a war with Russia in 2008 and seeks to join NATO. Pence is scheduled to attend the drills in Georgia on Tuesday and later visit Montenegro, NATO's newest member.\n\nPence also warned that Moscow continues to \"seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine democracies of sovereign nations, and divide the free nations of Europe, one against another.\" His visit to the region comes as Moscow announced that 755 staff must leave U.S. diplomatic missions in Russia, in retaliation over new sanctions imposed for Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russian interference in the U.S. election.\n\nIn response to the move, Pence said, \"We hope for better days, for better relations with Russia.\" He added, \"Recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow will not deter the commitment of the United States of America to our security, the security of our allies.\"",
    " Title: Actor Jussie Smollett Charged with Filing False Police Report in Chicago\n\nArticle:\n\nUS actor Jussie Smollett, known for his role in the television series Empire, has been arrested in Chicago and charged with filing a false police report. The actor had previously claimed he was the victim of a homophobic and racist physical attack in January.\n\nPolice suspect that Smollett, aged 36, paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, are cooperating with the investigation, according to US media reports. They are due to appear in court later on Thursday. Smollett's lawyers earlier stated they would \"mount an aggressive defense.\"\n\nDoubts over Smollett's claim began to grow after police said they could not find any video footage of the alleged incident from surveillance cameras, and there were no witnesses. However, investigators managed to track two men who appeared on video footage near where Smollett said he had been attacked.\n\nThe brothers, who are Mr. Smollett's personal trainer and have worked as extras on Empire, were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week. They were released without charges after providing information that \"shifted the trajectory of the investigation,\" police said.\n\nA lawyer for the brothers, Gloria Schmidt, said they had chosen to testify because \"there was a point where this story needed to be told.\" She added, \"They manned up and said: 'You know what? We're going to correct this.'\"\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage that appeared to show two people buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers.\n\nSmollett turned himself in early on Thursday and is in custody of Chicago police, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. He faces felony charges for disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.\n\nThe actor is being temporarily held at the Cook County Jail and has been separated from other prisoners, which is common for notable inmates, according to Chicago media reports. If found guilty, he faces up to three years in prison and may also be forced to reimburse police for the cost of their three-week-long investigation.\n\nFollowing the charges, Smollett's legal team released a statement saying, \"Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.\"\n\nSmollett, who is gay, said he had gone out to buy food late at night in downtown Chicago when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him. They allegedly punched the actor, poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck. Smollett also claimed the men had told him \"this is Maga country,\" apparently referring to President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. The actor said he had been \"forever changed\" by the alleged incident. An outpouring of support followed, including from Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell.",

The coordinated effort was led by the Boston Globe, with participants ranging from newspapers with circulations as low as 4,000 to larger publications. The Boston Globe encouraged editorial boards to participate regardless of their political point of view.\n\nThe Boston Globe's editorial board wrote, \"The principle of a free press has protected journalists at home and served as a model for free nations abroad. Today it is under serious threat.\" In a recent poll, 48 percent of Republicans and 29 percent of Americans overall agreed with President Trump that the news media is the enemy of the people. Forty-three percent of Republicans and 26 percent of Americans said the president should be able to close news outlets for bad behavior.\n\nThe Globe's editorial board further stated, \"To label the press 'the enemy of the people' is as un-American as it is dangerous to the civic compact we have shared for more than two centuries.\" Editorial boards around the country added their own words on Thursday.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune wrote, \"A free press is the cornerstone of democracy. It is the only means by which the people can be informed and hold their elected leaders accountable.\" The Arizona Republic stated, \"A free press is the guardian of democracy, the watchdog of the powerful, and the voice of the voiceless.\"\n\nThe president appeared to respond to the editorials on Twitter Thursday morning, stating, \"THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country.... BUT WE ARE WINNING!\" He also tweeted, \"The Boston Globe, which was sold to the Failing New York Times for 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses & investment) or 2.1 BILLION DOLLARS, was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR.

    " Title: Americans' Perceptions of Political Discourse and Trump's Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent survey has examined Americans' attitudes about the tone and nature of political debate in the United States, including President Donald Trump's impact on political discourse.\n\n1. The survey found that large majorities of Americans (85%) believe that political debate in the country has become more negative, less respectful, less fact-based, and less focused on issues.\n\n2. Donald Trump is a significant factor in people's views about the state of the nation's political discourse. A majority (55%) say Trump has changed the tone and nature of political debate for the worse, while fewer than half as many (24%) say he has changed it for the better. One-in-five Americans say he has had little impact.\n\n3. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents overwhelmingly (84%) say Trump has changed political discourse for the worse. About half of Republicans and Republican leaners (49%) say he has changed it for the better, while 23% say he has changed it for the worse and 27% say he hasn't changed it much either way.\n\n4. Eight-in-ten or more Democrats say Trump's comments often or sometimes make them feel concerned, confused, embarrassed, exhausted, angry, insulted, and frightened. While Republicans are considerably less likely than Democrats to report these negative reactions to Trump's rhetoric, about six-in-ten (59%) say they are at least sometimes concerned by his comments, while about half say they are at least sometimes confused (47%) or embarrassed (53%).\n\n5. Majorities of Americans have strong feelings about what is acceptable for elected officials to say in political debate. Most agree that it is fine for an elected official to say their opponent is uninformed on the issues. However, 41% say it is never acceptable to say their opponent is anti-American, and another 31% say this is rarely acceptable.\n\n6. Americans broadly agree that elected officials should avoid using heated language because it could encourage violence. Nearly three-quarters of Americans (73%) say this, while just a quarter believe that elected officials \"should be able to use heated language to express themselves without worrying about whether some people may act on what they say.\"\n\n7. While majorities in both parties say officials should avoid heated language, this view is more widely held among Democrats (83%) than Republicans (61%).\n\n8. Republicans believe that the national climate for political discourse is more hospitable to Democrats than for the GOP. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (64%) think that \"Democrats in this country are very comfortable to freely and openly express their political views,\" but only about a quarter (26%) think Republicans around the nation experience that same level of comfort.\n\n9. Most Americans say there is not consensus in the public on what constitutes racist or sexist language. About six-in-ten Americans (61%) say people generally don't agree about what is considered to be racist language, while 38% believe that people do agree on this. Views about agreement over sexist language are roughly the same.\n\n10. About two-thirds (65%) of Republicans and Republican leaners say people generally do not agree over the definition of racist language; 58% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same. Black people are somewhat more likely than whites and Hispanics to say people agree about what is considered racist language, although blacks, whites, and Hispanics are all more likely to say people do not agree on what kind of language is racist than to say that there is broad agreement.",
    " Title: Trump's Trade War Escalation: Fact-Checking the President's Tariff and Hurricane Aid Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn escalating his trade war, President Donald Trump persists in his argument that tariffs are a pure win for the U.S. and a loss for China. However, this perspective overlooks the costs of tariffs being borne by Americans.\n\nTrump has vowed to impose a blanket tariff of 25% on everything Americans buy from China. This would mean raising tariffs from 10% on $200 billion worth of goods by the end of the week and hitting an additional $325 billion in Chinese products with the same penalty \"shortly.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Trump stated, \"For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results.\"\n\nHowever, this notion of a transfer of wealth from China to the U.S. isn't happening. According to a study by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University, and Princeton University, the burden of Trump's tariffs on imports from China and other countries falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imports. By the end of last year, the study found, the public and U.S. companies were paying $3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing $1.4 billion a month in lost efficiency.\n\nMoney from tariffs is going into the federal treasury, but it's mostly, if not entirely, coming from U.S. businesses and consumers, not China, and it's not a driver of economic growth but rather a risk to it. That's why the stock market dropped on Monday.\n\nA coalition of U.S. trade organizations representing retail businesses, tech, manufacturing, and agriculture sharply disputed Trump's statement. \"For 10 months, Americans have been paying the full cost of the trade war, not China,\" it said. \"To be clear, tariffs are taxes that Americans pay, and this sudden increase with little notice will only punish U.S. farmers, businesses, and consumers.\"\n\nTrump invariably describes the U.S. trade deficit as money \"lost\" to other countries, an equation that ignores the value to Americans of what they've bought. \"We've lost so much money with China,\" he told an audience in March. \"We lose with everybody, almost.\" People are no more losing money than when they buy groceries\u2014rather, they're spending it and getting food.\n\nIn another tweet on Monday, Trump asserted, \"Puerto Rico has been given more money by Congress for Hurricane Disaster Relief, 91 Billion Dollars, than any State in the history of the U.S.\"\n\nHowever, this claim is not true. The money that Congress has allocated to Puerto Rico for hurricane relief so far is nowhere close to $91 billion. According to the White House, Trump's $91 billion estimate includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $41 billion already approved. Actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed more slowly from federal coffers, about $11 billion so far.\n\nThe expected $50 billion in additional money is speculative. It is based on Puerto Rico's eligibility for federal emergency disaster funds for years ahead, involving calamities that haven't happened. The White House's $91 billion figure for Puerto Rico, even if correct, would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost the U.S. government more than $120 billion\u2014the bulk of it going to Louisiana.",
    " Title: Christie Vows Cooperation in State of the State Address Amid Ongoing Bridge Scandal Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie pledged cooperation with all inquiries into the ongoing \"Bridgegate\" scandal during his State of the State address on Tuesday. The speech, which took on national interest due to the investigations into the alleged political retribution, aimed to refocus the political focus away from the George Washington Bridge controversy.\n\nIn his address, Christie accepted ultimate responsibility for the alleged political retribution, stating, \"Mistakes were clearly made, and as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve.\" The governor's administration will cooperate \"with all appropriate inquiries\" to ensure the breach of trust does not happen again, he said.\n\nChristie emphasized economic successes of his first term and called for cooperation from the Democratic-led state Assembly and Senate. In a span of 10 paragraphs, he used the word \"we\" 17 times in describing specific achievements such as job creation and economic growth.\n\nOutlining a conservative agenda of no additional taxes and more law enforcement, the governor also proposed education reforms and programs to help drug offenders rejoin society. The most emotional moment came when Christie told the story of Craig Hanlon, a former drug addict from his hometown now working as a practicing attorney.\n\nThe New Jersey State Assembly committee investigating the bridge controversy made public more than 2,000 pages of documents last week, suggesting politics was behind the unannounced lane closures on the New Jersey side of the bridge last September that caused traffic gridlock in Fort Lee. The documents suggest that top Christie aides orchestrated the traffic mess to punish that town's mayor for not endorsing their boss, and that they allegedly tried to stonewall media inquiries into the matter.\n\nChristie has fired one top adviser for her apparent role in the scandal and other key advisers have left their jobs. He has repeatedly apologized for being \"blindsided\" by what his aides and appointees were doing.\n\nFederal officials are also looking at whether Christie improperly used Superstorm Sandy relief funds to produce tourism ads promoting the Jersey shore's recovery that starred him and his family. In the new inquiry, federal auditors will examine New Jersey's use of $25 million of the funds for the marketing campaign, according to New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone.\n\nWhile political observers say the bridge scandal is not good for Christie, the Sandy investigation has the potential to be more damaging to his national image since it was his signature achievement following the storm. On Tuesday, Christie did not specifically mention the audit by the HUD inspector general. In what might have been an ironic reference to Sandy funding, Christie praised the cooperative spirit in the state that helped its recovery from the storm, seeming to describe his own challenges now. \"Let that spirit of Sandy be a powerful lesson to all of us, that when times are most difficult, cooperation and progress are possible,\" Christie said. \"Indeed, I tell you, they're necessary.\"",
    " Title: North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un Reappears, Sparks New Mystery Over Use of Cane\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reemerged after a six-week absence, quelling rumors of his ill health or potential removal from power. However, a new mystery has arisen: the reason for his use of a cane.\n\nKim, last seen publicly at a Sept. 3 concert, was pictured on Tuesday, smiling broadly and leaning on a walking stick while touring the newly built Wisong Scientists Residential District and another new institute in Pyongyang, as part of his regular \"field guidance\" tours. The North Korean government did not disclose the exact date of the visit or address Kim's health status.\n\nThe appearance of Kim allows the country's extensive propaganda apparatus to continue its mission of glorifying the third generation of Kim family rule and to suppress rumors of a coup and serious health issues.\n\nBefore Tuesday, Kim missed several high-profile events he typically attends, and he was described in an official documentary last month as experiencing \"discomfort.\" Archive footage from August showed him overweight and limping, leading to speculation in South Korean media that he had undergone ankle surgery. Some experts suggested he was suffering from gout or diabetes.\n\nA South Korean analyst suggested that Kim broke his media silence to dispel external speculation about his control and to garner sympathy from the domestic audience by portraying a leader who works through pain. Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea, described the appearance as \"emotional politics meant to appeal to the North Korean people's sympathy.\"\n\nKim's use of a cane marks the first time a North Korean leader has been seen relying on such an aid, according to South Korean officials. Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008 and died of a heart attack in late 2011, was seen limping but never with a walking stick. The country's founder and Kim Jong Un's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, did not use a cane, said Lim Byeong Cheol, a spokesman from Seoul's Unification Ministry.\n\nCheong noted that Kim appeared to have lost about 22 pounds compared to pictures from May. He speculated that since Kim was holding a cane on his left side, he may have had surgery on his left ankle.\n\nKim's reappearance aims to demonstrate that he is in good health, though he may still be experiencing some discomfort, according to Cheong. The South Korean government has not detected any major problems.\n\nIn resuming public activity before fully recovering from his condition, Kim seeks to quickly quell rumors that his health problems are severe enough to threaten his status as North Korean leader, said Lim, the government spokesman.\n\n\"The cane aside, he looked to be in good health,\" Lim said.\n\nBruce Cumings, an expert on Korea at the University of Chicago, suggested that the recent absence was a deliberate attention-getting device. \"The North has been on a diplomatic offensive in Europe and elsewhere, it feels isolated\u2014and is, if we're talking about relations with Washington\u2014all this puts them back on the front page,\" Cumings wrote in an email.",
    " Title: Romney Proposes \"Choose-Your-Own-Deduction\" Tax Reform Plan Ahead of First Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, has begun to outline specifics for his tax reform plan in anticipation of the first debate with President Obama, detailing a \"choose-your-own-deduction\" approach. During an interview with Fox Denver affiliate KDVR, Romney explained that taxpayers could select and claim deductions individually, with a potential cap of $17,000.\n\nRomney suggested that taxpayers could fill a $17,000 \"bucket\" with the deductions they prefer, such as charitable, home mortgage, health care, or other deductions. He added that higher-income individuals might have a lower cap. A Romney campaign aide later stated that the $17,000 cap could change, and the tax rate cut could be offset by imposing a dollar cap on personal exemptions and reducing health care tax preferences.\n\nThe Romney campaign has not disclosed the exact cost of the 20% tax rate cut, but a separate source who worked with the deficit-reduction \"supercommittee\" on Capitol Hill estimated it could cost up to $1.7 trillion over 10 years. The Romney campaign aide described this figure as \"possible.\"\n\nRomney spokesman Kevin Madden stated that the ideas for offsetting the tax rate cut reflect suggestions that may be considered during discussions with Congress. Romney may present his \"bucket\"-list proposal during the first presidential debate on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Obama campaign has criticized Romney for not disclosing the specifics of his tax plan, with Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter stating, \"Romney has never explained how he would pay for his massive new tax cut for the wealthiest.\" Cutter also noted that Romney has not specified which deductions he would eliminate.\n\nBoth campaigns have managed expectations for the debate, with Obama's advisers claiming Romney has practice from the primary season, while Romney's advisers note that Obama is the only one on stage with general election debate experience. The debate, one of three this month, is a high-risk, high-reward event for both candidates.\n\nThe debate is scheduled for 9 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, October 3. Each campaign has allotted half of the six, 15-minute debate segments to topics related to the economy, with the remaining three segments focusing on health care, the role of government, and governing. The next debate is scheduled for October 16, and the lone debate for the vice presidential candidates is October 11.",

The changes aim to make it easier for users to find and edit the personal information the company holds.\n\nIn a blog post, Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, acknowledged the damage caused by the Cambridge Analytica revelations and stated the need for improved enforcement of the company's policies and better understanding of how Facebook works and the choices users have over their data.\n\nThe changes include a \"simplified\" settings menu, a new privacy shortcuts menu, revised data download and edit tools, and a new page called \"Access Your Information.\" The revised tools allow users to review past interactions with the site, including things they have \"liked\" and the comments they have posted, with the option to make deletions. Users will also be able to download specific categories of data, including their photos, from a selected time range.\n\nAlthough it is not mentioned in the blog, the BBC understands the firm also intends to make the link to fully delete an account more prominent. The changes are set to take effect before the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May, toughening the requirements on how organizations handle personal data.\n\nFacebook insists the move has been in the works for months, but the company acknowledges the urgency of the situation. \"Facebook recognizes it's clearly lost people's trust and it needs to get to work on regaining that,\" said Stephen Deadman, its global deputy chief privacy officer.\n\nThe question remains whether the social network should be more proactive in warning users about the data they are sharing. The new one-stop shop for privacy and security settings may not be enough for busy users to take back control without more nudging.\n\nThe changes come as Facebook faces fresh criticism from New Zealand's privacy watchdog, which has accused the firm of breaking local laws by refusing to provide data about a dispute involving one of its citizens. The man involved had wanted access to information about what others had written about him. Facebook has responded, stating, \"We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year's worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticized us for protecting their privacy.\"\n\nSince the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook's privacy practices have come under fresh scrutiny. The UK-based consultancy has denied using the data to aid President Trump's election campaign and claims it had deleted the information. However, the British company suspended its chief executive following other allegations. Nearly $80bn has been wiped off Facebook's market value since 16 March, when it revealed it had received reports that Cambridge Analytica had not destroyed data about millions of its US members, as demanded several years previously.",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Upholds Texas Abortion Restrictions, Sparking Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has declined to block controversial Texas abortion restrictions, which have been labeled as some of the strictest in the country. The court's 5-4 vote denied a request by Planned Parenthood to block a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, allowing key parts of the Texas abortion law to remain in effect while the lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward.\n\nThe four liberal justices who voted in favor of the request expressed their intention to overturn the appeals court's Oct. 31 ruling that allowed the law to take effect. In its 20-page ruling, the panel of appeals court judges acknowledged that the law's provision requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions.\n\nHowever, the panel stated that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having \"the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion can not be enough to invalidate\" a law that serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself. The provision has led at least 12 clinics in the state to stop performing abortions since the ruling.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General's Office expressed satisfaction with the Supreme Court's ruling, stating, \"These are commonsense - and perfectly constitutional - regulations that further the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of Texas women.\"\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Rick Perry also expressed happiness with the court's decision, stating, \"This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions.\"\n\nThe appeals court panel left in place a portion of a previous judge's order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy. Doctors testifying before the court had said such women would be harmed if the protocol were enforced.\n\nThe appeals court's order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing, likely in January. The restrictions gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June. The law also bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.\n\nDuring the trial, officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision. Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges. Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.\n\nFox News' Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
    " Title: China's COVID-19 Case Numbers: A Closer Look at Transparency and Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to rise in the United States and other countries worldwide, the reported number of new cases in China, the source of the pandemic, has significantly decreased. Given China's history of secrecy, duplicity, and cover-ups, there is little cause to take the official figures at face value.\n\nThe National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the department responsible for tracking statistics during the crisis, has been publishing daily updates since late January. The commission reported a rapid increase in cases from January 25, with the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus skyrocketing from 1,287 to 17,205 in just over a week. At that point, according to the commission, 189,583 people had been identified as having had close contact with infected patients.\n\nThe commission also acknowledged on January 26 that \"More than 5 million people have left Wuhan due to the Spring Festival and epidemic.\" Given the timing and the annual festival's typical generation of nearly 3 billion trips, the \"epidemic\" was poised to sweep the nation of 1.3 billion people.\n\nHowever, against all odds, the National Health Commission of China reported no new domestically acquired cases, attributing every new case as \"imported\" by those returning to China. Over the last half of March, despite the massive dispersion of Chinese citizens from the epicenter of the virus, Wuhan, the commission has reported barely one new domestically acquired case per day.\n\nDespite compelling reasons for incredulity at China's official figures, the United Nations published an article titled \"China shows COVID-19 Coronavirus can be \u2018 stopped in its tracks.'\" The article is based on an interview with a \"WHO Representative in the country, Dr. Gauden Galea.\"\n\nDr. Galea has been in Beijing during the course of China's battle with COVID-19, except for a quick trip to Wuhan on January 21-22 before the city was even locked down, and the outbreak was still muted. The U.N. article goes on to say, \"At the time, there was no overwhelming demand on the health services, though the situation had changed when Chinese and international health experts conducted a joint mission a month later.\"\n\nVarious media organizations have similarly relied on China's numbers for some dramatic headlines. On March 18, The New York Times declared, \"China Hits a Coronavirus Milestone: No New Local Infections.\" While the article notes in passing that Chinese \"officials initially concealed and mismanaged the outbreak,\" it goes on to flatly assert that \"Beijing\u2019s sledgehammer approach...worked to quickly lower the number of infections.\"\n\nEight days later, The Times, again based on China's \"confirmed\" numbers, told the world that \"The U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases.\" While the article says that \"The Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state, and local officials,\" apparently, the Times applied considerably less rigor to acquire information on China.\n\nOn Monday, however, came news that China's numbers have indeed been incomplete. The Wall Street Journal reported that \"China said more than 1,500 people who were infected with the virus but haven\u2019t shown symptoms weren\u2019t included in its national tally of confirmed cases.\" This change so late in China's experience with the virus raises further questions about China's transparency, especially in light of some of the drastic measures the Communist government took early on to hush up the extent and seriousness of the epidemic.\n\nIf the past is any indication, the Chinese government will continue to hide the true consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak in that country as best it can. But the media and international health authorities would do well to view any data coming out of China with a more skeptical eye.",
    " Title: Four Governors Reaffirm Opposition to Recreational Marijuana Legalization\n\nArticle:\n\nFour governors, including two Republicans and two Democrats, have stated that their respective states will not follow the lead of Colorado and Washington in legalizing recreational marijuana. During an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Texas Governor Rick Perry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, was the first to express his opposition, stating a firm \"no.\"\n\nPerry, who has advocated for reducing penalties for marijuana use, has previously stated that current policies in Texas have contributed to a decrease in the state's prison population. He expressed concern about the potential consequences of criminalizing minor marijuana possession, stating, \"The idea that a kid has one marijuana cigarette and you send him to prison, where they can learn to really be a hardened criminal, is not thoughtful public policy.\"\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Pence, another potential White House contender, also expressed opposition to legalization. Pence, a Republican who took office last year, stated, \"That's been my position for a long time and will continue to be.\"\n\nDemocratic Governor Dan Malloy of Connecticut indicated that his state has decriminalized small amounts of marijuana and has moved forward with medical marijuana, but he expressed reservations about fully legalizing the substance. \"I think that's about as far as we go,\" Malloy said. He also cautioned against using tax revenue from marijuana sales as an incentive for legalization, stating, \"They are two distinct issues. Let's not be enticed on that road because of money. It just doesn't make sense.\"\n\nMissouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, also indicated that his state was not heading towards pot legalization but acknowledged that some in his state are starting to open up to the idea of medical marijuana. \"I think our legislature might consider that, but I think to move beyond that at this point is a bridge too far,\" he said. Nixon added, \"That bridge has not yet been built.\"\n\nCNN's \"State of the Union\" airs Sundays at 9am ET. For more from State of the Union, click here.",
    " Title: Obama's Off-Record Interview Reveals Immigration Reform and Grand Bargain Pledges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a previously off-record interview with the Des Moines Register's editorial board, President Barack Obama made pledges for a second term, expressing confidence that Washington can strike a \"grand bargain\" on deficit reduction and immigration reform next year. During the conversation, the president took a swing at the Republican Party for alienating the Latino community, a fast-growing demographic group in the United States.\n\nThe Obama campaign released the transcript of the interview after the Des Moines Register's editor complained that the president's team had \"handcuffed\" the newspaper by insisting it be kept off record. In the interview, Obama discussed his plans for the economy, education, and energy development, while vigorously defending his term to date.\n\nPresident Obama stated, \"Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community. And this is a relatively new phenomenon.\" The Romney campaign responded by casting doubt on the president's editorial board comments, pointing to Obama's failure so far to pass comprehensive immigration reform despite pledges in 2008 to do so.\n\nCampaign spokesman Alberto Martinez said, \"It's a fascinating glimpse into how President Obama has taken the Hispanic community for granted for the past four years.\" Martinez added, \"He's caught making secret promises to an editorial board in Iowa, which also happens to be a promise he made in 2008, a promise he failed to keep, and a promise he does not repeat publicly.\"\n\nMuch of the rest of the Des Moines Register interview was focused on policy discussions. The transcript was turned over and published after editor Rick Green revealed that the White House had demanded the conversation be kept out of print. The president also defended the health care bill as a measure aimed at treating the economy and expressed no regrets for not pursuing additional stimulus measures at the time he was pushing for the health care overhaul.\n\nThe Des Moines Register's decision on an endorsement will not be impacted by the initial snub, according to editor Rick Green. \"That would be petty and ridiculous. We take far too seriously what's at stake this election and what our endorsement should say,\" Green wrote. Mitt Romney met with the editorial board in a barn in Iowa on Oct. 9, and the audio from that conversation was posted online.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in May, Suggesting Labor Market Losing Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market showed signs of slowing in May, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 138,000, according to a report released by the Labor Department on Friday. The employment gains in the prior two months were revised downward, indicating a potential loss of momentum in the labor market despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.\n\nThe economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. The manufacturing, government, and retail sectors experienced job losses in May. The manufacturing sector lost 4,000 jobs, the government sector lost 9,000 jobs, and the retail sector lost 6,100 jobs.\n\nDespite the weaker-than-expected job growth, the economy may still create enough jobs for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\nEconomists at JPMorgan in New York, Michael Feroli, stated, \"While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that.\"\n\nThe employment report showed a decline in employment, with 429,000 people dropping out of the labor force. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose 4 cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment.\n\nEconomists believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries about political scandals surrounding President Donald Trump and the potential impact on his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\n\nSung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, stated, \"Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market. The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks.\"\n\nEconomists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year.\n\nThere was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007.\n\nHowever, the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely.\n\nManufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs.\n\nDepartment store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's Inc, and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon. Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.",
    " Title: Indiana Primary: Cruz and Trump Face Off in High-Stakes Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz faces a critical test in Tuesday's Indiana primary, one of the last opportunities for the Texas senator to halt Donald Trump's momentum towards the GOP nomination. Cruz has been campaigning intensively in Indiana, securing the support of the state's governor and announcing retired technology executive Carly Fiorina as his running mate. However, Cruz's aides have expressed pessimism ahead of Tuesday's voting, preparing for a potential loss, although Cruz has vowed to continue his campaign if he has a viable path to victory.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has devoted more time to campaigning in Indiana than in most other states, underscoring his eagerness to eliminate his Republican rival and focus on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. While Trump cannot clinch the nomination with a big win in Indiana, a victory would make his path to the nomination easier and allow for more room for error in the remaining contests.\n\nRepublican leaders initially dismissed Trump as an entertainer who would fade once voting began. However, Republican primary voters have consistently supported Trump, granting him victories in every region of the country, including a string of six straight wins on the East Coast.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also faced off in Indiana's primary on Tuesday. Clinton holds a commanding lead over Sanders, having secured 91 percent of the delegates needed to win the nomination. This means Clinton can still win the nomination even if she loses every remaining contest.\n\nSanders has acknowledged that he faces a challenging path to overtake Clinton, one that depends on persuading superdelegates to back him over the former secretary of state. Superdelegates are Democratic Party insiders who can support the candidate of their choice, regardless of how their states vote. They favor Clinton by a nearly 18-1 margin.\n\nNeither Clinton nor Sanders planned to spend Tuesday in Indiana. Sanders was making stops in Kentucky, which holds a primary in mid-May, while Clinton moved on to Ohio, a key general election battleground.\n\nClinton's team has begun deploying staff to states crucial for the November election and is also raising money for the fall campaign. Meanwhile, Trump lags behind Clinton in general election preparations, despite hiring more staff to strengthen his slim team.\n\nA potential matchup between Clinton and Trump would pit one of the Democrats' most popular and highly-regarded figures against a first-time political candidate who is deeply divisive within his own party. Cruz and other Republicans have argued that Trump would be roundly defeated in the general election, denying their party the White House for a third consecutive term.\n\nHowever, Trump is the only remaining Republican candidate who can secure the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination through regular primary voting. Cruz, as well as Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who trails significantly in the delegate count, must try to block Trump in Indiana and the handful of other remaining states to push the race toward a contested convention.\n\nIn an unexpected strategy shift, Cruz and Kasich announced an informal alliance in Indiana. The Ohio governor agreed to halt spending money in Indiana to give Cruz a chance to compete head-to-head with Trump. Cruz has pledged to do the same for Kasich in Oregon and New Mexico, which vote in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, this strategy, which appeared to unravel even as it was announced, may have backfired. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Indiana primary voters disapproved of the Cruz-Kasich alliance.\n\n\"After they made the alliance, their numbers tanked,\" Trump said Monday. \"That's what happens when politicians make deals.\"",
    " Title: Dueling Reports on Benghazi Attack Released by Democrats and Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe investigation into the 2012 attacks on a diplomatic outpost and CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya, has resulted in competing and contradictory reports from Democrats and Republicans. The incident, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, has been the subject of a two-year investigation by members of the House from both political parties.\n\nThe primary objective of the investigation has been to examine the actions of senior U.S. military and civilian officials, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to determine if they could have taken actions to prevent the loss of life. On Monday, the panel's five Democrats released their report, followed by the majority Republicans' findings on Tuesday.\n\nIn the Democratic report, the U.S. military and the former secretary of state are cleared of any wrongdoing. The report states that the U.S. military could not have done anything differently on the night of the attacks to save the lives of the four Americans who perished. The report also notes that the State Department's security measures were \"woefully inadequate,\" but that Mrs. Clinton never personally turned down a request for additional security.\n\nIn contrast, the Republican report, led by House panel chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, states that the U.S. was slow to send help to the Americans in Benghazi \"because of an obsession with hurting the Libyans' feelings.\" The report also accuses the Obama administration of \"misleading the public over the incident and failing to protect U.S. personnel.\"\n\nThe Republican report, which labels Benghazi as the \"wild east,\" also criticizes Clinton for her role in the incident. Additionally, the report questions whether street protests precipitated the attacks, stating that a number of eyewitnesses remained in almost constant contact with officials in Washington during the attack, but none of the eyewitnesses mentioned a protest.\n\nThe White House and the investigating panel are also at odds as to whether President Obama should answer questions already submitted by the panel for the president's consideration. The fact that the Democrats have released their own report, while sitting on the same panel as Republicans, serves to heighten the partisanship of the inquiry.\n\nThe dueling Benghazi reports could have political repercussions for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Clinton, as the Benghazi investigation has already uncovered her use of a private email server to conduct government business, now the subject of an FBI investigation. The Democrats' report states that the cause of the attacks \"remains unclear to this day,\" quoting testimony by David Petraeus, in which the former CIA director says, \"To be candid with you, I am not sure that the amount of scrutiny spent on this has been in the least bit worth it.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration Issues Directive on Transgender Students' Bathroom Access in Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the Obama administration has issued a directive on Friday regarding transgender students' access to bathrooms and locker rooms in schools. The directive, formulated by leaders in the Education and Justice Departments, requires public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their chosen gender identity, regardless of whether their education records or identity documents indicate a different sex.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch stated, \"There is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex.\" The directive aims to clarify how school districts that receive federal funding can comply with Title IX, a law that \"protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance.\"\n\nSchools are obligated to treat students according to their chosen gender identity, and there is no requirement for students to present a medical diagnosis for the change, according to the directive. The Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, commended the move.\n\nChad Griffin, HRC President, stated, \"This is a truly significant moment not only for transgender young people but for all young people, sending a message that every student deserves to be treated fairly and supported by their teachers and schools.\"\n\nThe directive comes amidst a societal debate over the definition of gender identity, with some conservatives viewing gender as purely biological and set at birth, while many in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community consider gender identity as more fluid and highly personal. This tension has come to a head this week in North Carolina, where the state is embroiled in a legal battle with the federal government over its so-called bathroom bill.\n\nOn Monday, the Justice Department sued North Carolina over its bathroom law, HB2, or the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, stating that the legislation is discriminatory. HB2 includes measures that prohibit public school students from using school facilities consistent with their chosen gender identity. The lawsuit advises the state to confirm it will not be moving ahead with the legislation.\n\nAttorney General Lynch stated when announcing the federal lawsuit, \"This action is about a great deal more than bathrooms, this is about the dignity and respect that we accord our fellow citizens.\" North Carolina responded with a countersuit, stating that the state was given an unrealistic amount of time to comply with the federally-imposed compliance deadline.",
    " Title: Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli Challenges Court Ruling on State's Anti-Sodomy Law, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nVirginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has filed a legal petition challenging a recent court ruling that found Virginia's anti-sodomy law unconstitutional. The case, which has garnered national attention due to Cuccinelli's gubernatorial bid, involves a 47-year-old man, William Scott MacDonald, who was convicted of soliciting a sexual act from a 17-year-old girl.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled on March 12 that Virginia's \"Crimes Against Nature\" statute, which banned oral and anal sex, violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. One judge dissented, agreeing with a lower court that the Supreme Court's ruling in Lawrence v. Texas on sodomy laws applied only to consenting adults.\n\nCuccinelli's position in the case is to uphold the conviction of MacDonald. LGBT advocates have expressed disappointment, stating the law is unconstitutional and anti-gay. However, Cuccinelli's spokeswoman, Caroline Gibson, stated that the case is not about sexual orientation but about protecting a 17-year-old girl from a 47-year-old sexual predator.\n\nCuccinelli's opponent in the gubernatorial race, former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe, has criticized Cuccinelli for focusing on \"divisive\" politics. McAuliffe's campaign stated that Cuccinelli is ignoring the economy and instead focusing on his ideological agenda.\n\nThe Cuccinelli campaign responded to McAuliffe's criticism with a statement, stating that it is \"sad and unfortunate\" that Democrats attack someone for protecting children from sexual predators. The campaign also noted that the case is about prosecuting a 47-year-old man who solicited sexual acts from a 17-year-old girl.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Cuccinelli's position on the anti-sodomy law has sparked debate, with some arguing that the case is unrelated to gay rights and is instead about protecting minors from predators. However, critics argue that Cuccinelli's intervention in the case opens the door to questions about his stance on sodomy laws in general, and his previous remarks on the subject will also be a point of contention.\n\nUPDATE: Journalist Josh Barro has pointed to previous remarks from Cuccinelli on the subject of sodomy laws in general, which Cuccinelli will have to address as the case and his stance on sodomy laws in general may be a point of contention for voters who do not believe various sexual acts between consenting adults should be barred by law.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Optimism, Addresses Race Relations and Gun Violence in Wake of Dallas Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference held in Warsaw, Poland, President Barack Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations in the United States, following the fatal shootings of two black males by police and the subsequent shooting of five Dallas law-enforcement officials by a gunman. The president emphasized that the actions of a few should not define the entire nation and that race relations have not reached a new low or regressed to the level of 1960s rioting.\n\nObama reiterated his commitment to addressing race relations, stating that he has revived the task force formed after the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, two years ago. The task force, which will include police officers, community and civil rights activists, and others, will discuss next steps.\n\nThe president acknowledged the decrease in violent crime in the U.S. over the past five, ten, and fifteen years. He also renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence, stating that it is crucial to address the issue of gun control in order to prevent further tragedies.\n\nIn the wide-ranging press conference, Obama also addressed topics such as Brexit, ISIS, and NATO. He spoke sympathetically of police officers in gun-filled communities, acknowledging the challenges they face when engaging with potentially armed individuals. He also expressed concern about the presence of guns in communities, citing the shooting of motorist Philando Castile during a traffic stop in suburban St. Paul, Minnesota, and the presence of an apparently legally owned gun in the car where the shooting occurred.\n\nThe president also addressed the Dallas sniper, Micah Johnson, a black Army veteran, as a \"demented individual\" and emphasized that such actions do not represent the values of the American people. He declined to label the Dallas shooting as a hate crime, stating that it is difficult to interpret the motives of mass shooters.\n\nObama also addressed the ongoing issue of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, stating that it is important for both sides to ensure the process is as sensible and orderly as possible. He reaffirmed the U.S.'s close friendship and commercial partnership with both the U.K. and the E.U.\n\nIn conclusion, President Obama emphasized the importance of addressing race relations, gun violence, and international issues in a thoughtful and measured manner, and called for unity and understanding in the face of adversity.",
    " Title: Romney Outraises Obama in May Fundraising by Nearly $17 Million\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's presidential campaign raised $76.8 million in May, surpassing President Barack Obama's fundraising efforts by nearly $17 million. The Republican fundraising haul, the first full month that Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee were in partnership, was nearly double the amount collected in the prior month.\n\nPresident Obama's campaign announced on Thursday that its joint fundraising operation with the Democratic National Committee had raised $60 million in May. According to a statement from Mr. Romney's campaign, the campaign and the Republican National Committee ended May with $107 million in cash.\n\nSpencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's national finance chairman, stated, \"It is clear that people aren't willing to buy into 'hope & change' again. Voters are making an investment because they believe that it will benefit the country.\"\n\nThe surge in fundraising for Mr. Romney came after he clinched the delegates necessary to become the Republican nominee, allowing Republican donors who may have been on the sidelines during the primary process to contribute. It also paved the way for the Republican National Committee to link its operations and fundraising efforts with the Romney campaign.\n\nAides to Mr. Obama said they were not especially worried because they had expected Mr. Romney to have a good fundraising month. They stated that some Republican donors likely gave the maximum they could in May and will not be able to give again in the coming months.\n\nThe financial comparisons underscore the concern that Mr. Obama's campaign has expressed to supporters over the past several months about the need for stepped-up financial contributions. Democrats have warned that despite the president's fundraising prowess, he could be outspent during the upcoming months as Mr. Romney's spending is supplemented by historic levels of fundraising by outside political groups, particularly \"super PACs.\"\n\nMr. Obama's campaign announced his total on Twitter Thursday morning, stating that the average donation was just over $50. The $60 million includes money raised directly by his campaign and by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe announcement by Mr. Obama comes two days after Republicans succeeded in beating back the recall of Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who had a big lead over his opponent in campaign cash. Mr. Obama held a fundraiser with Hollywood celebrities, including the actor George Clooney, in early May, just after he announced his support for same-sex marriage. The event reportedly raised $15 million for Mr. Obama's campaign.\n\nDemocrats had worried whether Mr. Obama's public support for the issue would cost him support in important swing states like Virginia and North Carolina. However, the decision was hailed by supporters of Mr. Obama's in the gay community, and it appears to have bolstered fundraising for the president among wealthy members of that group.",
    " Title: Low Gas Prices: A Boon for Consumers, but Concerns over Deflation Persist\n\nArticle:\n\nAcross the United States, gasoline prices have been steadily decreasing over the past few weeks, currently averaging around $3 per gallon. This downward trend has contributed to a minimal increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) last month, with the 12-month CPI rise at 1.7 percent, significantly lower than its historical average.\n\nHowever, some economists express concern that prolonged decreases in energy prices could lead to deflation, a phenomenon last observed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Deflation is considered a potential economic danger due to its destructive impact on businesses, housing, and investments.\n\nTo illustrate the risks, consider a factory owner who must purchase parts and raw materials, pay workers, and repay loans. If prices start falling, the owner may struggle to meet loan repayments, fulfill contracts with workers, or afford the inventory already on hand. This downward pressure creates a vicious cycle that can lead to a broad decline in the value of businesses, homes, and investments.\n\nThe source of the downward price pressure can be traced to weak economic growth in both Europe and China. As consumers and companies in these regions cut their energy and goods purchases, global prices fall. Central bankers and policymakers worldwide are taking steps to stimulate growth and prevent further price declines.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, aims to maintain a 2 percent inflation rate. Given the deflationary pressures emanating from Europe, the Fed may hold off on increasing interest rates until the CPI rises significantly.\n\nFor most Americans, this situation means that wages and prices are stagnant, while interest rates remain low. While the danger of deflation looms, the drop in energy prices has so far benefited consumers. Many are enjoying the benefits of low inflation, such as cheap car loans and affordable gas, which can stimulate the economy by increasing travel and consumer spending power.\n\nA case in point is Macy Gould, a Lexington, Ky. resident who graduated from college in May. She was delighted this past weekend when she refueled for about $2.83 a gallon. \"Spending less on gas is a real help to me,\" she said, noting that a driving trip she wanted to make to St. Louis was previously unaffordable. Now, with gas prices significantly lower, \"I'm hoping I can get that back on the calendar.\"",
    " Title: Obama Stands Firm on Debt Ceiling, Gun Control in Final Press Conference of First Term\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final press conference of his first term on Monday, President Barack Obama reiterated his stance that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling, stating that Washington must increase the limit to pay its bills. The president described such brinkmanship as \"absurd\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\n\"The issue here is whether Washington will pay its bills,\" Obama said. \"We are not a deadbeat nation.\"\n\nThe press conference, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, primarily focused on the debt ceiling and Obama's gun-control plans following the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, where 26 lives were lost.\n\nObama, who has vowed to curb gun violence, reiterated his promise, stating, \"If there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step.\"\n\nThe president also suggested that gun rights groups may be exaggerating strong turnouts at gun shows to create fear among gun owners that the federal government is planning to confiscate their firearms.\n\nIn response, Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, said, \"The president should go talk to the people buying firearms and ask them why they're buying firearms.\"\n\nObama also clarified that some of his proposed changes can be implemented through executive action, while others will require legislation.\n\nThe president used the press conference to emphasize that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending, but rather pays for bills that have already been incurred.\n\nRepublican leaders responded by stating that the debt limit debate is connected to spending, suggesting another round of intense negotiations when Congress returns later this month. House Speaker John Boehner stated, \"The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time.\"\n\nBoehner's remarks contrasted sharply with those of Obama, who said near the start of the press conference that he won re-election on his plan, which separates the debt ceiling from talks about reducing the U.S. deficit through spending cuts and increasing tax revenue through closing loopholes.\n\nObama argued he has already reduced federal spending by $1.2 trillion over the past two years but remains willing to discuss more cuts, including some to Medicare.\n\nHowever, the president acknowledged that the Republican-controlled House likely has enough votes to demand spending cuts be part of the debate, which would result in no increase to the debt limit and the country defaulting on its bills.\n\nThe House of Representatives returns to negotiate with the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House on three fiscal matters with looming deadlines: the debt ceiling, massive federal spending cuts known as sequester, and a budget resolution.\n\nThe talks resume because Washington again failed after the November elections to reach a long-term solution to the country's debt and deficit issues.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell stated that Obama and his allies need to get serious about spending, and that the debt limit debate is \"the perfect time for it.\" The Kentucky senator also called the country's debt and deficit a \"huge, huge problem.\"\n\nOn a question about Obama nominating only men to his Cabinet for his second term, the president told critics to wait until his selections are complete \"before they rush to justice.\"",
    " Title: White House Bans CNN Reporter Jim Acosta, Sparks First Amendment Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent ban of CNN reporter Jim Acosta from the White House grounds has sparked a debate over freedom of the press and the First Amendment. The ban, which followed a heated exchange between Acosta and President Donald Trump during a press conference, has been met with criticism from media outlets and legal experts.\n\nAccording to reports, Acosta's behavior, described as \"rude\" and \"terrible\" by President Trump, did not prevent White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Trump from routinely calling on him during question and answer periods over the past 22 months. The White House could have easily avoided Acosta by ignoring his questions, but they regularly called on him, using his extended responses to create a public spectacle that has become a staple of their anti-press strategy.\n\nThe ban and subsequent lawsuit filed by CNN today demand that Sanders and Trump return Acosta's \"hard pass\" and allow him to roam the White House grounds. The lawsuit cites case law that prevents the White House from arbitrarily banning reporters from White House press facilities \"for less than compelling reasons.\"\n\nThe original charge for barring Acosta, that he had placed his hands on a White House intern during the presser, has been disproved. Today, Sanders shifted her rationale for the ban, accusing Acosta of not surrendering the microphone when approached by the intern. However, Sanders acknowledges that Acosta's resistance was not an isolated incident.\n\nThe Acosta ban has turned him into a free speech martyr, with many, including legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, predicting that the matter will be resolved \"quickly\" in CNN's favor. The televised White House briefings, which have become political theater under Trump's management, have generated minimal news value, with many relying on reporters like Maggie Haberman who spend little time in the daily briefings waiting for news to arrive.\n\nThe Acosta-Trump faceoff has provided an entertaining sideshow, but it has also detracted from the primary purpose of journalism. The endless bickering between Sanders and the press corps and her obfuscations have become the story, rather than the news they are intended to report. The White House has yet to comment on the lawsuit or the ongoing debate over freedom of the press.",
    " Title: Fourth Republican Senator Opposes Trump's Expected Nomination of Herman Cain for Federal Reserve, Possibly Jeopardizing Confirmation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump's anticipated nomination of former pizza chain executive Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve appears to be in jeopardy after a fourth Republican senator voiced opposition, potentially denying Cain the necessary support for confirmation in the post.\n\nSenator Kevin Cramer stated, \"If I had to vote today, I would vote no.\" If all Senate Democrats and the two independents aligned with them were to vote against Cain, he would fall short of the majority support he needs.\n\nABC News, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported late on Thursday that Cain was expected to withdraw his name from consideration in the coming days. Cain declined comment on the report.\n\nSenators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Cory Gardner, all Republicans, have each reportedly said they would vote against Cain if he is nominated. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell withheld comment on Thursday on whether he would support Cain, saying he would wait to see \"who is actually nominated.\"\n\nEconomists and critics have expressed concerns about loyalists of Republican Trump serving on the traditionally nonpartisan central bank. Cain has been a public advocate of many of Trump's policies, as has Stephen Moore, another person Trump has said he wants to nominate. Neither nomination has been formally sent to the Senate.\n\nOn Facebook earlier this week, Cain said the reason he was under attack as a nominee was because he is a conservative. Cain's bid for president in 2012 was derailed by accusations of sexual harassment that he has repeatedly denied.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier on Thursday that Trump intended to proceed with his plan to name Cain to the Fed's board of governors.\n\n\"I like Herman Cain,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \"As to how he's doing in the process, that I don't know... Herman is a great guy, and I hope he does well.\"\n\nThe president nominates members to the Fed's seven-member board of governors. He elevated Jerome Powell to chairman a year ago but has frequently criticized him for the Fed's interest rate increases. The nominations must be approved by the Senate. The central bank's other top policymakers head the Fed's 12 regional banks and are chosen by local boards of directors, not the president.\n\nRelated Coverage:\n- U.S. Senate leader McConnell notes Republican worries over Cain serving on Fed\n- Trump has slammed the central bank's 2018 rate hikes for thwarting economic growth and publicly pressed policymakers to change course.\n- Central bank independence from short-term politics is seen as important to prevent influence that could lead to runaway debt, hyperinflation, and financial instability. The issue is a topic of conversation at the meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington this week.\n- \"Undermining central bank independence would be dangerous,\" Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund's monetary and capital markets department, said in an interview on Wednesday with Bloomberg News.",
    " Title: Secretary of State Kerry Advocates for Peaceful Resolution on Korean Peninsula, Reiterates U.S. Stance on North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry arrived in Tokyo today, concluding the last leg of his Asia trip, with a focus on finding a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions on the Korean peninsula. During his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, Kerry reiterated the Obama administration's commitment to seeking a peaceful resolution and expressed the U.S.'s willingness to engage in direct talks with North Korea, provided Pyongyang takes steps towards denuclearization and negotiates responsibly.\n\nKerry's visit to Japan comes as North Korea has escalated its rhetoric towards Tokyo. On Friday, the regime singled out Japan as the potential first target in the event of a war on the Korean peninsula, raising concerns in a country that does not have a combat military but only self-defense forces. In response, Japanese Foreign Minister Kishida stated that Japan is prepared for such contingencies, including potential missile launches, but added that Tokyo would continue to pursue a \"dialogue and pressure\" policy.\n\nKerry's visit follows meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, during which both parties expressed confidence in China's willingness to pressure North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and calm tensions on the peninsula. In a joint statement, Kerry and Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi reaffirmed the U.S. and China's commitment to working towards the denuclearization of North Korea.\n\nIn North Korea, festivities continued for the 101st birthday celebration of founder Kim Il Sung, with Pyongyang hosting an international marathon. However, Pyongyang has not ceased its threats towards the outside world, denouncing South Korean President Park Geun-hye's offer of dialogue as a \"cunning ploy\" and an \"empty shell.\" The Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint economic project between the two Koreas, remains shut down after North Korea pulled out its 53,000 workers in response to tension-building measures in the past few weeks.\n\nAnalysts have speculated that North Korea may launch a mid-range Musudan missile before the April 15 celebration. In an effort to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, Park offered peace through dialogue on Thursday, a move welcomed by Kerry, who has repeatedly expressed his support for bilateral talks. Kerry stated that any missile launch would be a \"huge mistake.\"\n\nIn related news, South Korean local media have questioned the whereabouts of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who has not been seen in public for the past two weeks. This has prompted speculation that Kim may be toning down his fiery threats or posturing for a launch. Kim is expected to appear in a military parade in Pyongyang on Monday.",
    " Title: U.S. Delegation to Sochi Winter Olympics Includes Openly Gay Athletes, High-Ranking Officials Absent\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States will not be sending any high-ranking officials to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Russia, a move that is being seen as a snub to Russia. The U.S. delegation, however, will include openly gay athletes, such as tennis legend Billie Jean King and figure skater Brian Boitano, who will participate in the games' opening ceremonies on February 7.\n\nThe White House announced Tuesday that former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, White House aide Rob Nabors, and the U.S. ambassador to Russia will round out the delegation to the Sochi games. Billie Jean King, who was one of the first professional athletes to come out as gay in the 1980s, will join Boitano at the games' opening ceremonies.\n\nSpeed skaters Bonnie Blair and Eric Heiden, as well as openly gay hockey player Caitlin Cahow, will also attend the games, with Cahow appearing at the closing ceremony two weeks later. The absence of high-ranking U.S. officials amounts to a snub to Russia, whose relationship with the United States has fractured over the past year.\n\nThe selection of this delegation, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday, sends the message that the United States is a diverse place. Carney pointed to Napolitano, a former Cabinet secretary, as evidence of the delegation's distinction. It's the first time in more than a decade that the President, vice president, first lady, or former president has not attended an Olympic opening or closing ceremony.\n\nThe absence of high-ranking U.S. officials is due in part to new laws in Russia banning gay \"propaganda\" -- a law critics say is so vague that anyone can be prosecuted for wearing a rainbow T-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex. The rift between the nations has also been fueled by the admission of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who was granted temporary asylum in Moscow, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's use of Russia's veto on the United Nations Security Council to block action in Syria.\n\nObama canceled a meeting with Putin that was scheduled for September, though the two met as part of a larger group of world leaders at the Group of 20 conference in St. Petersburg. The President has been vocal in his criticism of the Russian policy, stating in August that he has \"no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them.\" During his visit to Russia earlier this year, Obama met with the leaders of Russian social activist groups.",
    " Title: Governors Grapple with Health Care Decisions Following Supreme Court Ruling\n\nArticle:\n\nGovernors from across the United States convened in Williamsburg, Virginia over the weekend, with health care high on their agenda. The focus was on the federal health law, following the Supreme Court's recent ruling that granted states the option to expand their Medicaid programs.\n\nRepublican governors, in particular, expressed surprise by the Supreme Court's decision, which declared the health law constitutional but allowed states to decide whether to enroll most individuals earning more than approximately $15,000 per year in their Medicaid programs.\n\nUtah Governor Gary Herbert stated, \"A lot of us, certainly on the Republican side, believed it would be found unconstitutional. So I think it's just added more confusion to the issue rather than settling the issue.\" He further added that the November election would likely provide more clarity on the implications moving forward.\n\nVirginia Governor Bob McDonnell, the meeting's host, declined to reveal his state's plans regarding Medicaid expansion, citing the need for more information. \"Honestly, I don't think it's responsible for my state to make a decision now because there's still more information we need,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic governors, such as Delaware's Jack Markell, the incoming chairman of the National Governors Association, view the situation differently. Markell stated, \"This is not political. This is a financial analysis of what does it mean to cover, in our case, an additional 30,000 people,\" and added that Delaware taxpayers would benefit from the expansion.\n\nUnlike Republicans, who argue that the Supreme Court decision added confusion, Democrats, like Maryland's Martin O'Malley, maintain that the decision should have ended the debate. O'Malley stated, \"I think most governors understand that the Supreme Court's decision was a final and clear ruling.\"\n\nSome Democratic governors were less diplomatic in their comments. Vermont's Peter Shumlin criticized some of his Republican colleagues for not being honest about their intentions regarding the health law. Shumlin stated, \"Have a spine. The American people are sick and tired of spineless politicians.\"\n\nO'Malley of Maryland believes that many Republican governors will eventually accept the federal Medicaid funding for economic reasons, once the election is over. He stated, \"Once the posturing of the election is past, I think that a lot of these governors are going to have a hard time going home to their doctors, nurses, hospitals and explaining to them why they are passing up an opportunity to transform these dollars into better economic uses for job creation in their states.\"\n\nHowever, for many Republican governors, such as Nebraska's Dave Heineman, the issue is about more than just economic interests. \"They all say it's free federal money. No, it's not. That's our tax dollars,\" Heineman said. \"It's costing every one of us.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, governors seemed to agree on one point: there are still many questions they want the federal government to answer as the health law's implementation progresses.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Hear Case on Digital Privacy, Pitting Microsoft Against U.S. Government Over Overseas Emails\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to hear a significant case on digital privacy, this time involving a dispute between the federal government and Microsoft over emails stored overseas. The case, which adds to the court's already busy term concerning technology and law, follows a similar case regarding cellphone location data.\n\nThe Microsoft case dates back to 2013 when U.S. prosecutors demanded Microsoft turn over emails linked to a drug-trafficking case, which were stored only on Microsoft servers in Ireland. Microsoft complied with the information it had stored in the United States but sued to block the warrant, arguing that U.S. law enforcement could not seize evidence held in another country.\n\nIn 2014, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered Microsoft to hand over the emails. However, last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York reversed the decision and ruled in Microsoft's favor.\n\nBy agreeing to hear the case, the justices are taking on an issue they could have left alone, as there is no split among federal appeals courts. In addition, Congress is considering legislation that would fill in some blanks left by the Stored Communications Act of 1986, which did not address communications held overseas.\n\nMicrosoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith argued that the court should have waited for Congress to act. \"The current laws were written for the era of the floppy disk, not the world of the cloud,\" he said on his blog. \"We believe that rather than arguing over an old law in court, it is time for Congress to act by passing new legislation.\"\n\nHowever, the Trump administration urged the high court to take on the case. \"Neither the absence of a circuit conflict nor the speculative possibility of eventual legislative action diminishes the acute and present need for this court\u2019s review of a legally unsound decision that is frustrating important investigations around the country,\" it said in legal papers.\n\nThirty-three states weighed in on the government's side, arguing in a brief submitted by Vermont that the appeals court decision \"is interfering with the ability of state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute crime in their jurisdictions.\"\n\nMicrosoft argued that Congress is the proper forum to address the issue, noting that the Justice Department proposed a legislative fix before appealing the lower court ruling to the Supreme Court. \"Revising a federal statute to account for the globalization of data is a job for Congress, not courts,\" Microsoft told the justices.\n\nThe company warned that the nation's technology sector would be harmed \"if it becomes the conduit through which U.S. law enforcement can seize the private communications of every U.S. service provider\u2019s customers, no matter where in the world those customers are located or their data is stored.\"",
    " Title: Republican Governors Opt Out of Medicaid Expansion Under Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision last month, several Republican governors have announced their intention to forego the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. On Monday, Texas Governor Rick Perry joined this group, stating that Texas will not participate in Medicaid expansion.\n\nPerry's decision follows similar moves by other GOP state executives who have declined to offer Medicaid to individuals with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. This year, that equates to approximately $15,000 for an individual or $25,000 for a family of three.\n\n\"We're not going to participate in any exchanges,\" Perry said on Fox News. \"We're not going to expand Medicaid. We're just not going to be a part of, again, socializing health care in the state of Texas. And going in direct conflict with our Founding Fathers' wishes and freedom, for that matter.\"\n\nPerry and his colleagues argue their rejection of the health law is primarily based on ideological reasons. The states' concerns stem from the fact that, when it comes to Medicaid, they do not appear to be on the hook for significant financial contributions.\n\nAccording to Jeff Goldsmith, a health policy analyst who teaches public health at the University of Virginia, the Affordable Care Act provides 100% coverage for people newly eligible for Medicaid by the federal government in the initial years, and 90% in subsequent years. This compares to the rest of the Medicaid program, where the federal government pays an average of just under 60%.\n\nHowever, states are not only concerned about the newly eligible population. Dennis Smith, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and former head of the federal Medicaid program under President George W. Bush, states that this year, his state put more than a billion dollars into its existing Medicaid program. Even with enhanced federal match rates, Wisconsin had a $600 million budget shortfall.\n\nAnother concern for states is the so-called \"woodwork effect.\" When major parts of the health law take effect in 2014, there is a worry that it will bring out of the woodwork the millions of people who are already eligible for Medicaid but are not currently enrolled. These individuals may discover cheaper health insurance options through the health exchanges, leading them to sign up for Medicaid instead.\n\nBruce Lesley, president of First Focus, an advocacy group for children and families, notes that many of these individuals signing up for Medicaid will not be part of the newly eligible expansion group, whose bills will be largely paid by the federal government. They will be regular Medicaid beneficiaries, and states will have to pay up to half their costs.\n\nGoldsmith states that state officials are most concerned about the ease with which currently eligible but unenrolled Medicaid recipients can sign up. \"It won't be an in-person visit, it won't be a 'bring six forms of ID,'\" he says. \"There will be an expedited\u2014lubricated, if you will\u2014process to get people onto the rolls, and I think that's the part that's giving state budget officers serious indigestion at this point.\"\n\nGoldsmith notes that state officials he has spoken to worry that Medicaid, already the largest piece of almost every state budget, could end up dwarfing everything else. \"The health and human services secretary of Louisiana told me that at full implementation, 48% of the citizens of his state would be on Medicaid,\" he says. \"And I strongly suspect that [as] you go across the Southern tier of the United States, you'll see a lot of those states in the 30s. A third of their citizens eligible for or potentially enrolled in Medicaid.\"\n\nSome states are already looking at cutting back their Medicaid programs. Wisconsin's Dennis Smith, who used to run the federal Medicaid program, states he interprets the Supreme Court decision as allowing this. However, the Obama administration disagrees. Last night, it sent a letter to all the nation's governors, noting that \"the Court's decision did not affect other provisions of the law.\" An administration official confirmed that included the requirement that states maintain current eligibility levels until the year 2014.\n\nHealth advocate Lesley agrees with the administration. \"Our reading of the Supreme Court ruling is [that] the opinion by Justice Roberts...cites basically a specific section of the law and basically changed the idea that the Medicaid expansion can no longer be a mandatory thing, but now is optional,\" Lesley says. \"However, what it did not touch on was this idea of requiring states to maintain coverage. So we believe that that is absolutely still in place.\"",
    " Title: Negotiations with Iran Remain Tough as Deadline Approaches; New Approaches Explored but No Proposal Reached\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for negotiations between the United States and Iran approaches, Secretary of State John Kerry has acknowledged the difficulty of reaching an agreement, stating, \"These talks are not going to get easier just because we extend them.\" The talks, which involve six different nations, have been described as tough and are expected to remain so.\n\nOfficials have provided little detail about the new approaches being explored with Iran, only indicating that experts from the Energy Department's national laboratories will study them to determine if they, in combination with other steps, would provide at least a year's warning if Iran were to pursue a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe potential steps could include Iran committing to ship some of its nuclear stockpile to Russia, disconnecting some of the country's centrifuges in a manner that would take considerable time to reverse, and implementing output limits that can be verified by international inspectors. A European diplomat involved in the discussions described the process as having \"a lot of moving parts,\" with the question being what the combined efforts amount to.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated late Monday that the new ideas do not represent a proposal by either side but rather a compilation of ideas exchanged between the negotiating parties. Zarif reiterated his commitment to maintaining the secrecy of the negotiating room and expressed concern over leaks from the discussions, which have been prevalent throughout the talks.\n\nSecretary Kerry praised Mr. Zarif, acknowledging the challenges he faces in navigating Iran's complex political landscape and the uncertainty regarding how far Iran's supreme leader will allow him to go. The negotiations aim to end sanctions that have significantly reduced Iran's oil revenue, devalued its currency, and made overseas financial transactions difficult.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Urge White House to Reject Union's Call for ObamaCare Subsidy Extension\n\nArticle:\n\nThirty-one Republican senators have written a letter to President Obama urging the rejection of union demands to extend ObamaCare subsidies to workers who already have job-based health coverage. The senators argue that such an extension is prohibited under the law.\n\nThe senators' letter, sent on Thursday, follows a report in a newspaper that unions, concerned about the law's other requirements potentially increasing health care plan costs, are seeking access to federal subsidies for lower-paid workers.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the Obama administration initially dismissed the idea of aiding workers in union-sponsored policies. However, a Treasury official, in the same article, stated that the issue is \"the subject of pending regulations.\"\n\nThe senators, in their letter, disagree with the Treasury's stance, stating that it \"ignores the letter of the law.\" They argue that several provisions in the health care law could increase the cost of coverage, including the elimination of caps on benefits.\n\nThe senators contend that workers with an employer-based plan cannot, under the law, receive subsidies intended for those who do not get insurance through their jobs. They cite a Congressional Research Service report stating that employer-sponsored coverage would \"generally\" make an employee \"ineligible to receive a premium subsidy.\"\n\nThe subsidies, along with most major provisions of the health care law, are set to go into effect next year. According to The Wall Street Journal, approximately 20 million people are covered in plans run by unions and employers.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), and Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) are among those who signed the letter to Obama. The senators suggest that concerns about rising premiums could be addressed by revisiting the taxes, fees, and other policies that contribute to premium increases, rather than considering an extension of subsidies not envisioned in the statute.",
    " Title: Baltimore Police Brutality: A Detailed Account of Victims and Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing protests in Baltimore, a detailed account of police brutality incidents and their victims has emerged. Over the past four years, more than 100 people have won court judgments or settlements related to allegations of brutality and civil-rights violations. The city of Baltimore paid a total of $5.7 million to victims of police brutality between 2011 and 2014.\n\nOne of the victims, Venus Green, a 87-year-old grandmother, was a former teacher with two college degrees who spent her retirement years as a foster parent for needy children. In an incident that took place on her porch, Green was brutally treated by a white police officer who responded to an emergency call.\n\nAccording to an 11-page letter detailing the incident for her lawyer, Green's grandson ran up to her crying for an ambulance. The officer became hostile, questioning the grandson and accusing him of lying. Green, who had no criminal record, defended her grandson, stating that he had run from a different direction and had called for the ambulance. The officer wanted to enter the basement, but Green, fearing her dogs would attack, refused. The officer then shoved Green against the wall, hit the wooden floor, and handcuffed her.\n\nGreen was thrown face-down on the couch, arrested, and complained of pain. An African-American officer later entered the house, saw Green sobbing, and had the handcuffs removed since Green was not violent. Green suffered a broken shoulder and did not face any charges. The payout in this case was $95,000.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun's article provides a detailed account of other victims of police brutality, including a 15-year-old boy riding a dirt bike, a 26-year-old pregnant accountant who had witnessed a beating, a 50-year-old woman selling church raffle tickets, and a 65-year-old church deacon rolling a cigarette. The incidents detail a frightful human toll, with officers battering residents who suffered broken bones, head trauma, organ failure, and even death during questionable arrests. Some residents were beaten while handcuffed, and others were thrown to the pavement.\n\nThe ongoing protests in Baltimore can be contextualized within this recent history of police brutality and the victims' stories.

Obama stated that if negotiations are contingent on all issues being settled prior, there would be no purpose for negotiations.\n\nObama's remarks came amidst the backdrop of a morning rocket launch from the Hamas-controlled Gaza, two of which landed in southern Israel. The issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the end to violence were key topics during the meeting between the two leaders.\n\nWhile Obama discussed the settlement issue at length during his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, he did not endorse Abbas' position that ending settlements should be a prerequisite for peace talks. Instead, Obama reiterated the longstanding U.S. policy that continued settlement activity is not constructive or appropriate for advancing the cause of peace.\n\nThe President also addressed Israel's security concerns, referencing them on several occasions and citing the Thursday morning attack as an example. Obama's tone on the settlement issue was more restrained compared to his 2009 statement when he declared that the U.S. \"does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.\"\n\nIn addition, Obama outlined the American role going forward as one of helping to \"build confidence\" and \"rebuild a sense of trust\" between the two parties.

    " Title: NBC Sportscaster Bob Costas Clarifies Anti-Gun Remarks, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to clarify his controversial anti-gun remarks during a Sunday Night Football broadcast, NBC sportscaster Bob Costas appeared on the O'Reilly Factor on Tuesday. The interview aimed to address the \"misunderstanding\" surrounding Costas' comments regarding the NFL player Jovan Belcher's shooting of his girlfriend.\n\nCostas, who has faced heavy criticism for his comments, has repeatedly tried to shift the focus by stating, \"I was quoting a column.\" However, when Costas made the remarks on Sunday, he explicitly acknowledged that he was quoting a column by Kansas City-based writer Jason Whitlock.\n\nFurthermore, Costas attempted to distance himself from the notion that his comments were about gun control. However, when Costas expressed concern about the number of guns in America, it is reasonable to assume that he advocates for stricter gun control measures. Costas also incorrectly stated that Americans can easily purchase \"automatic weapons,\" which requires special permits and rigorous background checks, and is not typically available at standard gun dealerships.\n\nCostas also attempted to use the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting to make political points, arguing that Colorado is a \"carry state\" and that patrons could have defended themselves if they were armed. However, the theater is a gun-free zone, and the shooter had a history of mental health issues that authorities failed to address before the tragedy.\n\nCostas' suggestion that people defending themselves from a madman are playing \"Dirty Harry\" was also met with criticism. In response, it is important to recognize that America has two distinct gun cultures, each with its own unique history and purpose.\n\nThe first gun culture is deeply rooted in American history and the founding of the country. The Second Amendment was designed to ensure that an armed citizenry would prevent government tyranny. Historically, firearms have been used for collection, personal protection, hunting, sport, and celebrating American history. The firearms industry generates billions in tax revenue and employs millions of people.\n\nThe other gun culture is found in urban areas such as Chicago, Washington D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles. This culture is characterized by violent gun use within gangs and is often glorified in Hollywood films, rap music, and NBA parties.\n\nIn conclusion, it is essential for Costas to educate himself about the realities of American gun culture, guns, and gun laws before continuing to make controversial statements that may be misinterpreted or used to score political points.",

The bill, which now returns to the House for final approval, includes significant changes to the budget sequesters, with funds allocated for full-time slaughterhouse inspections but no changes made to reopen the White House for public tours.\n\nThe 73-26 vote signals a growing consensus in Congress that the government shutdown showdowns of the past two years have not benefited either party. The bill, which funds basic operations through September 30, does not reverse the level of sequester cuts but does rewrite a few priorities, including restoring the military's tuition assistance programs and restoring funds for food inspections.\n\nWithout the additional funding, federal inspectors would have been furloughed, and meat-packing plants would not have been able to operate without on-site inspectors. This could have resulted in a significant decrease in U.S. meat production, with industry officials predicting a 2 billion pound decrease in beef and pork and a 3 billion pound decrease in poultry.\n\nSenators added the inspection money back in by unanimous vote. \"It was important that Congress act to prevent a potential crisis from developing in our nation's food supply,\" said Sen. Christopher A. Coons, Delaware Democrat. \"Backlogs in food inspections could result in the shutdown of processing facilities and send devastating ripple effects through rural communities and straight to the shelves of every market and grocery in the country.\"\n\nIn a separate vote, senators declined to undo President Obama's decision to cancel White House tours, which he made earlier this month as one of the casualties of the budget sequesters. Sen. Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, offered an amendment to restore White House tours, proposing to cut $8 million from spending on national heritage areas in the National Park Service budget. However, senators, led mostly by Democrats, rejected that plan, arguing that the money would hurt economic development in their home states.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Democrat who led the opposition, also said he doubted whether the money would go to reopen the White House. \"Those tours are governed by the Secret Service, which is not part of this amendment, so that would not be affected,\" he said. Sen. Coburn countered that the tours were indeed at stake in the vote. \"The National Park Service does have something to do with White House tours because they can take this money and reallocate it. It is not a Secret Service problem. It is a national park problem,\" he said.\n\nThe Senate defeated Mr. Coburn's amendment on a 54-45 vote, with nearly every Republican voting to reopen the White House and with almost all Democrats voting to back President Obama's decision. \"We're focused on all the wrong things because it's all about the next election,\" said Sen. Coburn.\n\nWith the 2013 spending bill now cleared, the Senate turns its attention to the 2014 budget. House lawmakers have already begun that debate, with Republicans defeating three Democratic alternatives on Wednesday. The main Democratic substitute was killed on a 253-165 vote, with even 28 Democrats balking at the tax and spending increases. Hours earlier, Democrats tried to embarrass Republicans by refusing to cast votes on conservative Republicans' alternative. Rather than vote for or against the conservative budget, Democrats voted \"present\" - taking themselves out of the equation and making Republicans have to choose between backing the conservative blueprint, which calls for severe spending cuts, or to vote against it and risk the anger of tea party voters. The final vote was 132-104 against the conservative plan, with 14 Democrats and 118 Republicans voting against it, and just 104 Republicans voting for it. If the conservative budget had won the vote, it immediately would have become the official House budget, replacing the plan drawn up by Rep. Paul Ryan. Democrats wanted to force that situation, figuring the conservative budget would be too extreme for many moderate Republicans and therefore would ruin Republican efforts to pass a budget this year.",
    " Title: Congressional Response to the Alleged Death of Jamal Khashoggi Remains Unclear Amid Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe suspected death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has sparked a flurry of tough talk on Capitol Hill, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stating that he \"can't imagine there will be no response\" to the incident. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have a complex and pragmatic relationship, with both nations sharing aligned interests in the Middle East. However, the exact response from Congress remains unclear, as both houses are currently in recess for the midterm elections until November 13.\n\nSenators from both parties have been vocal about Khashoggi's fate. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested sanctions against Saudi Arabia, warning of a bipartisan backlash if the Saudis are found responsible for Khashoggi's death. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) stated, \"Murder is murder,\" while Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) criticized the U.S.'s perceived subservience to the Saudis.\n\nHowever, the potential impact of Congress on Saudi Arabia is limited, as the U.S. needs a relatively stable presence in the Middle East beyond Israel and Jordan. The use of harsh words or sanctions against the Saudis could potentially inflame the kingdom and destabilize the region. As Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) noted, \"If we can't draw a clear line, shame on us.\"\n\nOne potential action Congress can take is the imposition of Global Magnitsky sanctions, a tool that allows the U.S. to punish foreign powers for human rights abuses such as extrajudicial killings, torture, or detention. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), have requested an investigation into potential human rights abuses by Saudi Arabia. If the Trump Administration finds evidence of such abuses, the U.S. can impose sanctions.\n\nThe timeline for any action is unclear, as the current Congress will be in a lame-duck session after the midterm elections. It is likely that any prospective discipline for Saudi Arabia will be taken up by the new Congress in 2019.\n\nThe Khashoggi affair also raises questions about the Trump Administration's stance on violence against journalists, as President Trump has publicly praised physical violence against the press. This has led some to question the Administration's sincerity in addressing the Khashoggi case.\n\nThe future of Saudi Arabia-related discussions on Capitol Hill remains uncertain, with the departure of moderate Republicans and the complexities of the U.S.-Saudi relationship creating a challenging environment for meaningful action. The new Congress will tackle this issue after January 3, 2019.",
    " Title: The Landscape of the American Gun Control Debate: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate on gun control in the United States is experiencing a shift, with students who survived the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School aiming to reshape the national discourse. Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, a senior at the school, recently addressed gun control advocates and politicians, stating, \"We are going to be the last mass shooting.\"\n\nThe American gun control debate is often perceived as a stalemate, dominated by the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA). However, there has been more action and gun violence prevention victories than many realize. Here is the current landscape that the Parkland students face as they demand new congressional action on gun control laws:\n\n1. Gun Ownership: Between 55 million and 75 million Americans own guns, but the NRA only claims 5 million members, which is less than 10% of America's total gun owners.\n\n2. Gun Ownership Distribution: Just 3% of American adults own half the country's guns. Most gun owners have one or two, but a tiny group of super-owners, who have an average of 17 each, collectively own half of the country's 256 million guns.\n\n3. Gun Experience: Seventy-two percent of American adults have shot a gun, even though only 20-30% personally own a firearm. In contrast, 44% of American adults say they personally know someone who has been shot, either accidentally or intentionally.\n\n4. Influence of the NRA: Twenty-nine percent of gun owners say the NRA has too much influence over gun laws, according to a recent Pew survey. However, overall, 55% of American adults say that the NRA has the \"right amount\" of power or even \"too little\" power over American gun laws.\n\n5. Second Amendment Compatibility: Most gun control legislation being debated now is 100% compatible with the second amendment. The Supreme Court's 2008 Heller decision, a pro-gun-rights ruling, made it unconstitutional to completely ban Americans from keeping handguns in their homes for self-defense.\n\n6. Previous Assault Weapon Bans: The 1994 American assault weapon ban did not accomplish much. The federal ban, which was allowed to lapse in 2004, allowed Americans to keep the military-style guns and ammunition they already owned. The law also defined \"assault weapons\" according to certain external features, allowing gun makers to tweak a few features and produce almost identical semiautomatic rifles that were compliant with the ban.\n\n7. Focus on Universal Background Checks: Most American gun control groups agree that fighting for universal background checks on gun sales is the law that would do the most good. They have shifted their focus away from banning assault weapons to closing the loopholes in the federal background check system, which currently allows private sales between individuals with no background check.\n\n8. Concerns about Moderation: Many gun control advocates worry the current movement is too moderate, and that it needs a more radical left flank. The NRA is often pushed to more extreme positions by smaller groups with even more hardline second-amendment views.\n\n9. Racial, Economic, and Geographic Disparities: Black children 17 and under are 10 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than white children. About half of America's gun murder victims each year are black. The census tracts that saw the worst gun violence in 2015 represented about 1.5% of the country's total population, but 26% of the total gun homicides.\n\nThis article provides an objective overview of the current state of the American gun control debate, highlighting key statistics and trends. It is important to note that this article does not express personal opinions or political bias, but rather presents factual information for the reader's consideration.",
    " Title: RealClearPolitics Poll Average Suggests Donald Trump's Support May Have Peaked\n\nArticle:\n\nKevin Drum, a political analyst, has observed a potential plateau in Donald Trump's poll numbers on RealClear Politics, suggesting that the Republican frontrunner may have reached his ceiling at 24.3 percent on August 5. Since then, Trump's numbers have dropped to 22.0 percent.\n\nHowever, other poll aggregators, such as Pollster, run by The Huffington Post, show a less definitive trend, with Trump's climb not yet showing signs of slowing down significantly. The discrepancies between the two sources can be attributed to differences in the polls included and the methodology used to calculate the averages.\n\nDespite the variations, both sources indicate that Trump's numbers have at least flattened, a trend that is likely to continue for the next several weeks due to the slow end-of-summer news cycle and the absence of significant ad buys before the next Republican debate.\n\nDrum predicts that 25 percent will be the peak of Trump's support, but this does not necessarily mean a decline in his candidacy. In a field of 16 candidates, 20-25 percent still places Trump as a frontrunner, and he remains a polarizing figure among Republicans. With a substantial personal fortune, Trump can sustain his campaign for an extended period.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible that Trump has reached his peak in terms of poll numbers, it does not imply a swift decline. Trump's position in the race remains strong, and he is expected to remain a significant factor in the Republican primary race for the foreseeable future.",
    " Title: Key Elements to Observe in Obama's Final State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will deliver a speech that deviates from his past addresses, focusing on thematic and future-oriented topics rather than a laundry list of legislative proposals. The White House has promised a different approach, with President Obama stating that the speech will not only discuss the progress made, but also what needs to be done together in the coming years to ensure a stronger, more prosperous America.\n\n1. Differences in the Speech's Content:\nThe speech will likely focus on big, unifying issues such as a minimum wage increase, tax reform for infrastructure investment, the Trans-Pacific trade agreement, and a criminal justice system overhaul. The White House is optimistic that Congress may approve these potentially bipartisan issues.\n\n2. Legacy Shaping:\nThis valedictory speech will aim to frame Obama's accomplishments in the most positive light. He will discuss the recovery of the auto industry, improving employment, his initiatives on climate change, gun background checks, and reopening relations with Cuba. The guests joining First Lady Michelle Obama in the House chamber have been selected to represent the arc of Obama's presidency.\n\n3. Aid to Hillary Clinton's Campaign:\nThe president is expected to frame the upcoming election in terms of economic growth and inclusivity, a theme that aligns with Hillary Clinton's campaign. He may also touch on hot-button issues that resonate with the Democratic base, such as climate change, gun control, immigration reform, or gay rights.\n\n4. Thematic Emphasis:\nThe speech is not expected to be overtly political, but the subtext will likely convey a message of progress and the need to continue moving forward. The president may emphasize the need for a shared prosperity, a theme that has been a focus of Clinton's campaign.\n\n5. Legacy Impact:\nA well-received State of the Union address can provide a political boost. President Obama is hoping this speech will help improve his approval ratings, which have been in the mid-40s for months, and potentially aid Hillary Clinton's campaign and his own legacy.",
    " Title: Clinton-Kaine Economic Theory on Great Recession Faces Fact-Checking\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent vice-presidential debate, Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, reiterated an economic theory first presented by Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate: that the Bush tax cuts of 2003 contributed to the Great Recession. This argument, however, lacks support from mainstream economic theories and empirical evidence.\n\nThe Keynesian view, a prominent school of economic thought, argues that deficit-financed tax cuts should stimulate the economy by encouraging spending. The Clinton-Kaine theory, in contrast, rejects this idea. Many economists argue that tax cuts that benefit the poor and middle-class deliver a bigger jolt to the economy, as such individuals tend to spend a higher fraction of their incomes. The Bush tax cuts of 2003 reduced rates for all tax brackets, but even if they had been geared solely to the rich, they would still have produced a stimulative impact on the economy, albeit a significantly diminished one.\n\nClassical and monetarist views argue that only permanent reductions in taxes have a positive impact on wealth in the long-run. The Bush tax cuts expired after eight years, so classical and monetarist economists could debate whether they count as a temporary fiscal shock or not. However, neither school believes that tax cuts have a negative effect on economic activity.\n\nThe only plausible economic theory that could support the Kaine-Clinton argument is that deficit-financed tax cuts create recessions by expanding public debt to the point of fiscal insolvency, as happened in Greece. But that's not what happened in the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009.\n\nEmpirical work on the impact of tax cuts in isolation suggests that they almost always boost consumption and economic activity to varying degrees. University of Michigan economist Matthew Shapiro has found that over the last decade, tax cuts ranging from the initial tax-rate reductions enacted in 2001 under President Bush to the 2009 payroll-tax cuts under President Obama boosted economic activity to varying degrees.\n\nIt's important to note that income and wealth inequality are a separate matter. Few argue (and rightly so) that any of these tax cuts are self-financing. The continuing trend whereby the government takes in less than it spends has led to perennial deficits for 15 years. Such deficits could create fiscal drag on growth in the future, but that will only come in the form of higher taxes and lower growth, which again goes to show that tax cuts do not directly spur recessions.\n\nThe Clinton campaign's argument on the Great Recession bears many resemblances to the false argument spouted by Bernie Sanders in the primaries: that the repeal of Glass-Steagall created the financial crisis. Both theories propagate a lie, and the Clinton campaign's argument should not be allowed to stand. It's the latest in a series of political maneuvers meant to slander the other party at the expense of honest policy discussion.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Overturns Trump's Attempt to Open Arctic and Atlantic Oceans to Oil and Gas Leasing\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge in Alaska has overturned U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to open vast areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil and gas leasing. The decision issued late Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason leaves intact President Barack Obama's policies putting the Arctic's Chukchi Sea, part of the Arctic's Beaufort Sea, and a large swath of the Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. East Coast off-limits to oil leasing.\n\nTrump's attempt to undo Obama's protections was \"unlawful\" and a violation of the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Gleason ruled. Presidents have the power under that law to withdraw areas from the national oil and gas leasing program, as Obama did, but only Congress has the power to add areas to the leasing program, she said.\n\nThe Obama-imposed leasing prohibitions \"will remain in full force and effect unless and until revoked by Congress,\" Gleason said in her ruling. Trump's move to put offshore Arctic and Atlantic areas back into play for oil development came in a 2017 executive order that was part of his \"energy dominance\" agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed a vastly expanded offshore oil leasing program to start this year. The five-year Trump leasing program would offer two lease sales a year in Arctic waters and at least two lease sales a year in the Atlantic. The Trump plan also calls for several lease sales in remote marine areas off Alaska, like the southern Bering Sea, that are considered to hold negligible potential for oil.\n\nObama had pulled much of the Arctic off the auction block following a troubled offshore Arctic exploration program pursued by Royal Dutch Shell. Shell spent at least $7 billion trying to explore the Chukchi and part of the Beaufort. The company wrecked one of its drill ships in a grounding and managed to complete only one well to depth. It abandoned the program in 2015 and relinquished its leases.\n\nIn a separate case, Gleason delivered another decision on Friday that blocks the Trump administration's effort to overturn an Obama-era environmental decision. Gleason struck down a land trade intended to clear the way for a road to be built through sensitive wetlands in Alaska's Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The Obama administration, after a four-year environmental impact statement process, determined that the land trade and road would cause too much harm to the refuge to be justified. Trump's then Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke broke the law when he summarily reversed the Obama policy without addressing the facts found in the previous administration's study of the issue, Gleason ruled.",
    " Title: Georgia Special Election Highlights Nationalized Local Elections and Party Loyalty\n\nArticle:\n\nThe special House election taking place in Georgia on Tuesday is a microcosm of a national trend, with the contest attracting significant media coverage, high-profile visits, and over $50 million in campaign funds, making it the most expensive House race in American history. Despite the intense focus, the outcome of this election will not determine the fate of either the Republican or Democratic parties in the near future.\n\nThe Georgia special election serves as an exaggerated version of the nationalized local election, a phenomenon that is expected to continue in 2018 and 2020. While there is only one other special election happening simultaneously in South Carolina, the closeness of the Georgia contest has drawn national attention and resources.\n\nIn the Georgia race, both candidates, Jon Ossoff (Democrat) and Karen Handel (Republican), have been cautious about positioning themselves as partisan crusaders. Ossoff's campaign focuses on cutting wasteful spending, reducing the deficit, and prioritizing high-tech and bio-tech research. Handel, despite a private fundraiser by President Trump, has emphasized her independence from the White House, stating that she represents the people of the 6th district and is not an extension of the White House.\n\nHowever, if Handel wins, she will be an extension of the Republican agenda, as a vote for her is a vote for the GOP's legislative agenda, including repealing the Affordable Care Act, cutting taxes for the wealthy, rolling back environmental protections, boosting military spending, and more. Ossoff, on the other hand, is a Democrat who, for all his technocratic talk, will have limited ability to bring jobs to metro Atlanta, and his votes will primarily reflect his party affiliation.\n\nIn conclusion, the Georgia special election serves as a reminder that voters are essentially voting for a party, rather than an individual representative. The 6th district's choice between Handel and Ossoff will determine whether to advance the Republican legislative agenda and support President Trump or to stop GOP legislation and make a Democratic takeover one vote more likely. This election, like many others, is a referendum on the national parties and their agendas, and voters should be aware of the implications of their choices.",
    " Title: House GOP Immigration Reform Faces Slow Death in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican leaders are set to meet with their members on Wednesday to strategize their approach to immigration reform, which appears to be facing a slow and prolonged demise in the House of Representatives. The House plans to adopt a piecemeal approach, with a potential border-security bill this month and one or two smaller reforms per month in the fall.\n\nIn private discussions, top Republicans on Capitol Hill predict that comprehensive immigration reform will struggle to gain traction due to the predominantly white, conservative constituency of most House Republicans. This contrasts with the party's post-2012 efforts to address their perceived issues with Hispanic voters.\n\nRep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) held a town meeting last week, during which every one of the 100 attendees argued against any immigration reform resembling the Senate-passed bill. Cotton expressed concern that even smaller, seemingly necessary reforms, such as a better tracking system for individuals in the country on visas, could become a \"Trojan horse\" for a larger package that prioritizes legalization over enforcement.\n\nThe momentum for a deal this Congress appears to be shifting against Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. Sen. Marco Rubio, a key proponent of the immigration reform bill, was able to secure the support of only 13 fellow Republican senators. This week, the editors of the National Review and Weekly Standard published a joint editorial in opposition to the bill, and private GOP headcounts show only a small fraction of House Republicans would ever vote for anything resembling the Senate deal.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a leading voice in the House's anti-immigration reform caucus, held a meeting on Monday to argue against the bipartisan bill. King contends that the Senate's immigration plan would benefit \"elites who want cheap labor, Democratic power brokers, and those who hire illegal labor.\" He asserts that the bill would harm the Republican Party, a sentiment that is widely shared among House Republicans.\n\nThe article does not provide information on the potential impact of this development on the broader immigration debate or the political landscape. It is unavailable whether other political parties or interest groups have expressed support for the piecemeal approach or the potential for further immigration reform legislation in the future.",
    " Title: Conservatives Face Challenge in Revitalizing Family and Civic Institutions Outside of Government\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2018 midterm elections, the Republican Party has been confronted with a stark reality: the political influence of President Trump is subject to the laws of political gravity. Democrats made significant gains in the House, maintained their Senate losses, and won down-ballot races, indicating a shift in voter preferences, particularly among suburban voters.\n\nSome Republican pundits are advocating for a new, policy-based form of Trumpism, focusing on addressing the bifurcation of opportunity based on education and the breakdown of the nuclear family. This approach is rooted in the work of conservative thinkers such as Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, and Oren Cass, who argue for the importance of strong families and communities in promoting long-term prosperity.\n\nDouthat, Salam, and Cass propose a combination of economic policies, such as regulatory reform and wage subsidies, to revitalize the labor market and strengthen families and communities. However, a fundamental question arises: is government intervention truly likely to lead to the revitalization of family and community? Or must the preconditions for economic thriving be in place first?\n\nThis question challenges the viability of political conservatism in the face of government-led intervention aimed at shoring up fundamental institutions. The limiting principle of such intervention is a matter of debate, with some suggesting that government intervention could go too far, as exemplified by Tucker Carlson's proposal to ban automatic driving due to potential job loss among blue-collar workers.\n\nConstitutional philosophy suggests that the institutions that hold up a safe, stable, culturally solid, and community-oriented world cannot be created by government. Churches do not thrive because of government subsidies, and families do not thrive because of government subsidies. Instead, these institutions are built on shared values, not material incentives.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental challenge for conservatism today is to convince Americans to re-engage with family and civic associations outside of government, as these institutions cannot effectuate such re-engagement themselves. Conservatives can focus on removing governmental disincentives toward family and community and work, as well as cultural disincentives, such as the left's focus on breaking down family structure, disdain for stay-at-home mothers, disparagement of religious Americans, and distaste for American cultural solidarity.\n\nHowever, the moment conservatives try to build Trumpism around a policy of government do-gooderism, they risk exacerbating the very problems they seek to alleviate. Americans value family and community because they have values, not because family and community must be made more economically valuable. If we rely on material incentives to prop up our most vital social institutions, those institutions are likely to continue disintegrating\u2014and to take the economic freedom we hope to promote in the end with them.",
    " Title: Harvey Weinstein Released on $1 Million Bail, Faces Rape and Sex Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nDisgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein has been released on a $1 million bail following his arraignment on Friday. He was charged in Manhattan court with rape, criminal sex act, and other sex-related charges stemming from encounters with two women. Weinstein surrendered to the New York Police Department and Manhattan District Attorney's office on Friday morning.\n\nAt the arraignment, Weinstein agreed to wear an electronic monitoring device, paid for at his own expense. He is only allowed to travel in New York state and Connecticut. If he desires to go to another state, he must seek permission. Weinstein has received a grand jury notice and by May 30 will decide whether to testify or not.\n\nThe victim has received an order of protection and will be identified to the court, prosecution, and defense but will otherwise remain anonymous. Weinstein turned himself in at NYPD's 1st Precinct around 7:30 a.m. ET, carrying books, including \"Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway Revolution\" and \"Elia Kazan about the stage and film director.\" Weinstein was noticeably struggling to walk.\n\nWeinstein left the station before 9 a.m. in handcuffs, headed to court for his arraignment. As Weinstein headed into the courthouse, AP reports he was questioned by the crowd. \"You sorry, Harvey?\" someone shouted. The question \"What can you say?\" was also raised. In reply, Weinstein softly shook his head and answered \"No.\"\n\nWeinstein has consistently denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Friday that he would fight to get the charges dismissed, saying they are factually unsupported and constitutionally flawed. Brafman issued a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 following Friday's proceedings, reiterating his client's stance. \"Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone. Nothing about today's proceedings changes Mr. Weinstein's position. He has entered a plea of not guilty and fully expects to be exonerated.\"\n\nPolice expressed their gratitude to Weinstein's accusers. \"The NYPD thanks these brave survivors for their courage to come forward and seek justice,\" a statement read. \"The arrest and ensuing charges are the result of a joint investigation between the NYPD and the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office.\"\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. also thanked Weinstein's claimants for their courage in a statement shared to Twitter on Friday. \"Thank you to the brave survivors who have come forward, our office\u2019s tireless prosecutors, and our dedicated partners at @NYPDNews,\" he shared before urging those with additional accounts or information to reach out.\n\nWhen discussing the accusations facing his client, Brafman reminded reporters Friday his job isn't \"to defend behavior; my job is to defend something that is criminal behavior.\"\n\n\"Mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood,\" he declared, \"and to the extent that there is bad behavior in that industry, that is not what this is about. Bad behavior is not on trial in this case; it\u2019s only if you intentionally committed a criminal act, and Mr. Weinstein vigorously denies that.\"\n\nFriday's events come nearly eight months after The New York Times exposed three decades of alleged sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to rape from accusers including Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Weinstein has been under investigation for months in New York, Los Angeles, and London.\n\nSeveral of the actresses who have made allegations against Weinstein, including McGowan and Annabella Sciorra, applauded his impending arrest on social media. \"The justice system has been something very elusive,\" McGowan said. \"I hope in this case it works. Because it\u2019s all true. None of this was consensual.\"\n\nWeinstein became a larger-than-life figure in Hollywood as co-founder of the \"mini-major\" studios Miramax (started in 1979) and The Weinstein Company (2005), producing and distributing awards-friendly films such as Oscar best-picture winners The Artist and The King's Speech. The domineering studio head amassed tremendous influence with his strong personality, his ability to identify and champion artistic projects, and his track record of Oscar success\u2014the latter cemented when Weinstein's Shakespeare in Love was a shock best-picture winner over Steven Spielberg's heavily favored Saving Private Ryan in 1999.\n\nThe Weinstein scandal has triggered a cascade of accusations against Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Louis Rose, Matt Lauer, and Morgan Freeman, among others.",

In an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Huckabee stated, \"I like Jeb. We're good friends. He'll be a very formidable candidate. But if I run for president... it's not going to be because someone else did or did not.\"\n\nHuckabee, who finished second in the Republican presidential nomination race in 2008, winning the Iowa caucus and several Southern primaries, expects to make a formal declaration about his intentions for the presidential race this spring. He recently stepped down from his political talk show \"Huckabee\" on the Fox News Channel to explore another presidential run.\n\nIn response to those who have discouraged 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney from making another run for the White House, Huckabee argued, \"It's wide open. Anyone could be a contender.\" He emphasized the unpredictable nature of politics, stating, \"On any given day your campaign can implode for something that happens inadvertently or intentionally.\"\n\nHuckabee concluded, \"So you never say that someone is not a contender, that they can't make it. I hear that all the time about a lot of different people. Nobody knows. Voters will make that decision, and that's the way it ought to be.\"",
    " Title: Police Accountability, Reform, and Militarization: A Look at the Challenges and Solutions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of George Floyd's death at the hands of a police officer, the nation is once again grappling with issues of police brutality and accountability. Protests, tear gas, mass arrests, and curfews have become common sights in cities across the country.\n\nAt \u2588\u2588\u2588, we have covered numerous stories about the police since our founding in 2014, including the challenges of police reform and the militarization of police departments. The following is a summary of some of the key issues and potential solutions that have emerged from our reporting.\n\nWhen a police officer is accused of misconduct or brutality, the process varies depending on the jurisdiction. In more than a dozen states, police officers enjoy their own Bill of Rights, which can mean that an officer under investigation does not have to answer questions for up to 10 days, and the department must continue to pay their salary and benefits. The rules become less clear when it comes to joint task forces, where federal agencies like the U.S. Marshals recruit local police departments to track down fugitives or fight terrorism. In such cases, the local officers assigned to joint task forces may not have to follow their own department's rules, such as wearing a body camera.\n\nReforming troubled police departments is a complex issue with a long history. A deep dive into the Kerner Commission Report, which was aimed at prescribing solutions after the race riots of the 1960s, revealed the shortcomings of federal attempts at police reform. More recently, we explored the use of consent decrees, a tactic where the U.S. Department of Justice can sue local police departments to change through court-enforced reforms. Alternatively, a local department can voluntarily adopt federally recommended reforms. However, the results of these efforts often fall short, as demonstrated in Cincinnati, where the police department was celebrated for successful federal intervention, but residents in low-income and middle-class neighborhoods reported few changes.\n\nIndividual officers also face challenges when trying to change their departments' operations. One officer was fired for trying to de-escalate a fraught encounter and not reaching for his gun first.\n\nTo better understand the root causes of police violence, we spoke to a range of people who have immersed themselves in the issue. David Simon, creator of \"The Wire,\" pointed to the drug war's role in changing policing in cities like Baltimore, where Freddie Gray was killed in police custody, sparking mass protests. Bryan Stevenson, author of \"Just Mercy\" and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, explored the historic role of the police in enforcing white supremacy in America. We also spoke to those with searing personal encounters, such as Erica Garner, whose father, Eric Garner, died in Staten Island after a New York Police Department officer put him in a chokehold.\n\nAnother contributing factor to excessive use of force by police is the increasing militarization of many police departments. For decades, the Defense Department has been passing surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies for free and with little scrutiny. This equipment includes grenade launchers, machetes, and bayonets. Many of these military-grade weapons were deployed in Ferguson, where police used weapons of war against protesters. The Obama administration banned the program after the waves of protest following police tactics in Ferguson; President Donald Trump reinstated it.\n\nOver the years, many police departments have explored options for crowd control during protests, including weapons labeled as \"nonlethal\" like bean bags and pepper balls, though they can inflict grievous harm. The militarization of police is not just a matter of equipment; in fact, as a Marshall Project story showed, nearly one-fifth of police officers have served in the military, where their training and experience can distort relations with the communities they serve.\n\nTo learn more about the reporting on policing in the days and weeks ahead, consider subscribing to our email newsletters.",
    " Title: NBC's Chuck Todd Criticizes Involvement of Former Political Operatives in News Executive Roles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with the conservative news site Breitbart, NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd criticized the involvement of former political operatives in news executive roles, seemingly taking a veiled shot at Fox News chief Roger Ailes, ABC's George Stephanopoulos, and potentially himself.\n\nDuring the interview, Todd stated, \"Look, it doesn't help when any former political operative is involved as a news executive in any form.\" The news executive in question is likely Ailes, who was a media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush. However, Todd himself served as a staffer on Democratic Senator Tom Harkin's 1992 presidential bid, and Stephanopoulos, the host of ABC's \"This Week\" and Todd's direct competitor on Sunday mornings, was a senior advisor to Democratic president Bill Clinton.\n\nIn the Breitbart interview, John Nolte told Todd that conservatives view the media as a whole as a branch of the Democratic Party out to annihilate them. Todd responded, \"That's a mindset I can't do anything about. There are some practitioners in the media that view things as a campaign. Look, it doesn't help when any former political operative is involved as a news executive in any form. It's all winning and losing.\"\n\nTodd's decision to speak to Breitbart, an aggressively conservative news and opinion site, reflects an effort to broaden the show's outreach. \"This is a step in the rehabilitation of my business,\" Todd said at the top of the interview. \"Talk to the critics. Talk to the skeptics.\"\n\nTodd's predecessor, David Gregory, had not been as eager to engage with conservative critics. In an interview with The Huffington Post earlier this year, he stated, \"I just made a decision... There are haters out there. I'm not going to engage those people, because they're not looking to have a dialogue with me over Twitter.\"\n\nChuck Todd's ratings have been declining since he took over the show, with ratings dropping each week.",
    " Title: Debate on Tax Revenue Sources for Democrats Erupted by AOC's Proposal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe tax proposal by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has ignited a debate among Democrats regarding the source of additional government revenue. While there is general consensus on the need for new revenue due to the growing federal budget deficit, the specific methods for raising funds remain contentious.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old Democratic representative from the Bronx, has garnered headlines with her suggestion of tax rates as high as 70 percent to finance the \"Green New Deal.\" However, it is crucial to clarify that Ocasio-Cortez did not propose taking 70 percent of anyone's income. Instead, she suggested applying the rate only to earnings beyond $10 million, meaning those affected would pay a much lower share of their income overall.\n\nHistorically, top tax rates exceeding 90 percent were in place during the 1950s. However, through deductions and tax avoidance, \"taxes on the rich were not that much higher\" then, according to the conservative Tax Foundation. The top rate remained 70 percent as late as 1981, the first year of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Despite the high top rate, the most affluent 1 percent paid a far lower average rate of 30.5 percent, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential campaign, self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a 54.2 percent tax for incomes above $10 million, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton suggested 43.6 percent for those earning above $5 million.\n\nThe new House Democratic majority has avoided the tax issue in its initial legislative agenda. However, the party's growing field of 2020 presidential candidates will not have that luxury.\n\nThe only formally declared Democratic candidate, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, wants to finance infrastructure projects by raising the recently enacted 21 percent top corporate rate to 25 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has proposed curbing income inequality by rolling back all the Trump tax cuts in favor of expanded tax credits for modest earners.\n\nWhen asked about fair tax shares in the economy, Sen. Elizabeth Warren declined to specify her preferred rates but expressed a need for new revenue. Betsey Stevenson, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, favors other targets, such as eliminating the \"step-up\" valuation that lets some inherited assets avoid capital gains taxes and capping tax deductions for the wealthy.\n\nThe amount of revenue Democrats need depends on the new programs they ultimately pursue. Analysts have priced Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan at $32 trillion, while Sen. Sherrod Brown backs a far less expensive Medicare \"buy-in\" for 55 and over.\n\nRepublican resistance casts doubts on the prospects for new taxes in any event. Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan warns a 70 percent top income tax rate would prove a \"terrible mistake\" by dampening economic activity.\n\nAs the party of limited government, the GOP opposes most new programs, regardless of how they're funded. With deficits ballooning following their tax cuts, GOP leaders suggest curbing the massive Social Security and Medicare programs. However, the demographic tidal wave of baby boomer retirements will swamp any politically feasible \"entitlement reform.\"\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, who advised President George W. Bush, agrees that governments led by either party will eventually need more revenue. He prefers taxing consumption instead of income on economic grounds, though any new taxes will strain America's polarized political system.\n\n\"We will need all the economic growth we can get, we need to control spending, and we need to raise revenue,\" Holtz-Eakin said, recounting advice he recently gave House Republicans. \"It's going to be ugly.\"",
    " Title: Texas-Led Coalition of 26 States Challenges President Obama's Executive Amnesty\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Monday that Nevada and Tennessee have joined the state's legal challenge of President Barack Obama's executive amnesty, bringing the total number of states involved in the lawsuit to 26.\n\nIn a statement, Attorney General Paxton said, \"Texas is proud to lead a coalition that now includes a majority of the United States standing up against the President's rogue actions.\" He further stated, \"The momentum against the President's lawlessness continues to build with Tennessee and Nevada joining the effort to protect our states from the economic and public safety implications of illegal amnesty.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen heard oral arguments in the case on January 15th, where Texas argued that Obama's amnesty would create a new wave of illegal immigration that would burden state governments. Texas attorney Andrew Oldham told Judge Hanen, \"This is the second time they've done it in two years. Maybe they'll do it again in 2016.\"\n\nObama's lawyer, Kathleen Hartnett, disputed that claim, insisting that new arrivals will not come \"on the expectation of receiving deferred action because they will be turned away.\" She added, \"His policy only applies to people who have been here since 2012.\"\n\nJudge Hanen is not likely to buy that administration argument. In a 2013 case, Hanen predicted that Obama's lax border enforcement policies would lead to a wave of illegal immigration. This prediction was confirmed in 2014.\n\nTexas and the other 25 states are asking Judge Hanen to issue an injunction that would stop Obama from granting work permits before the program begins in May. If Obama's amnesty does stand, it will reportedly cost taxpayers billions in tax credits every year.\n\nThe full list of 26 states suing Obama over his executive amnesty includes: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin.",
    " Title: Joey Gibson's Freedom Rally in San Francisco Canceled Due to Safety Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nJoey Gibson, leader of the group Patriot Prayer, announced the cancellation of his planned peaceful rally at Crissy Field in San Francisco on Saturday, citing safety concerns following opposition from various groups, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, local Democrats, and the antifa movement.\n\nDuring a press conference on Facebook Live, Mr. Gibson stated, \"It was the best thing to do for the city because the way it was set up is that a lot of innocent people were going to get hurt.\" He further explained that the event would have resulted in a \"huge riot\" due to the presence of radical activists from antifa and By Any Means Necessary.\n\nA separate right-of-center event scheduled for Sunday in Berkeley, titled \"No to Marxism in America,\" was also canceled by organizers due to fears of violence.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee urged residents to attend a rally at Civic Center Plaza instead, where thousands gathered for a \"unite against hate\" march, carrying anti-Trump signs and a large rainbow banner that read, \"Rise and Resist!\"\n\nAt a Saturday press conference, Mr. Lee commended the counterprotesters, stating, \"The face of love and compassion dominated over hate speech and inciting of violence.\"\n\nMs. Pelosi had called on the National Park Service to reconsider Patriot Prayer's permit, describing the event as a \"white supremacist rally.\" In response, Ms. Pelosi stated, \"Reason has prevailed because the people of San Francisco have demonstrated our determination to protect the freedom of peaceful expression as well as public safety.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Gibson accused Ms. Pelosi and Mayor Ed Lee of stoking unrest by labeling the event as a white supremacy rally, despite most of the scheduled speakers not being white and Mr. Gibson himself being half-Asian. He also accused Democrats of hypocrisy regarding protester violence, stating, \"You have a mayor who says that we\u2019re hateful, we\u2019re violent...he doesn\u2019t mention one word about antifa.\"\n\nThe rally, billed as a \"day of freedom, spirituality, unity, peace, and patriotism,\" was intended to exclude extremists, including Nazis, antifa, the Ku Klux Klan, and white nationalists, according to Mr. Gibson's assurances on Facebook. Despite these precautions, Mr. Gibson claimed he was menaced by antifa and By Any Means Necessary activists who followed the Patriot Prayer organizers and used Twitter to announce their whereabouts.\n\nMr. Gibson, who lives in Vancouver, Washington, started Patriot Prayer earlier this year to support President Trump but has since focused on fighting extremism on both the left and the right to promote peace and unity. His rallies in Portland and Seattle have attracted members of white-nationalist groups like Identity Evropa, which Mr. Gibson said he has tried to discourage.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which does not list Patriot Prayer as a hate group, has criticized the rallies for attracting the \"alt-right\" while crediting Mr. Gibson for speaking out against white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Mr. Gibson concluded, \"At the end of the day, I just want a small government, and then there will be no tyrants. And we will be free people in a free society who can respect one another.\"",
    " Title: Harvard's Admissions Practices Under Scrutiny for Alleged Discrimination Against Asian Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial revelation, Harvard University, one of the most prestigious colleges in the United States, is under investigation for allegedly discriminating against Asian American applicants. The target group is not blacks or Jews, as it was in previous years, but Asian Americans.\n\nAfter millions of dollars in legal fees, millions of records examined, and hundreds of hours of depositions and testimony, Harvard's once opaque admissions policies have been laid bare. The institution rates student applicants in three main ways: academic performance, extra-curricular achievements, and \"personal qualities.\" While these criteria might seem fair if applied objectively, they are not.\n\nAsian American applicants consistently score higher in the first two criteria \u2013 academics and extra-curricular activities, which can be objectively assessed \u2013 than white students, Latinos, and African Americans. However, Harvard justifies its Asian American quota with the help of the third criterion \u2013 \"personal qualities,\" which include vague and largely subjective factors like \"likability,\" \"maturity,\" \"integrity,\" and \"effervescence.\"\n\nAccording to Harvard's own internal reports, Asian American applicants are systematically marked much lower on this personality scale by Harvard admissions officers who almost never meet or interview applicants. Interestingly, the personality ratings given to Asian students by Harvard's own alumni interviewers, who actually meet the applicants in person, are vastly different. Alumni interviewers score Asian applicants as high as whites.\n\nIn other words, Harvard artificially and fraudulently downgrades Asians on \"personality\" to get the results it wants. And what Harvard wants is to suppress the number of Asian Americans admitted.\n\nBased on the data that Harvard was forced to turn over, economist Peter Arcidiacono of Duke University concluded that with the same application profile in terms of test scores, extracurricular activities, and personality factors, an Asian American male applicant would only have a 25% chance of admission \u2013 versus 32% if white, 77% if Hispanic, and 95% if black.\n\nIn 2013, Asian Americans made up 19% of the incoming freshmen class. According to Harvard's own Office of Institutional Research, if the personality factors had not been rigged, that percentage would have been 43%.\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 guarantees that \"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, or be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\"\n\nEach year, Harvard takes hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policies, deciding that race could be used as a \"plus factor\" to achieve diversity, but never as a quota. Yet, by placing strict limits on the percentage of Asian American applicants it will admit, racial quotas are exactly what Harvard is using.\n\nOne strongly suspects this quota system is not limited to Harvard. In the last ten years, Asian American students have been limited to an 18-22% presence across the Ivy League. Or maybe that's just a coincidence.\n\nWriting for the majority in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the Court \"expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\" With less than a decade to go, the Ivy League shows no indication that it's giving up on those racial preferences. Instead, these colleges have doubled down. Objective standards regarding admissions continue to be increasingly disfavored as the illegal goal of racial balancing is advanced.\n\nThis racial balancing is justified by the left's desire to achieve \"racial diversity\" \u2013 its insistence on seeing every person only through the prism of race, as if the most important thing any of us has to offer is the color of our skin.\n\nNot long ago, that was called \"racism.\" It's still called racism.\n\nIt needs to end, once and for all \u2013 for the sake of deserving Asian American students, for the sake of Harvard's own integrity, and for the sake of the American principle that the rules must be the same for everyone.\n\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts said it best: \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\nIt's time we did just that.

    " Title: A Case for Mitt Romney's 2016 Presidential Bid: A Retrospective Analysis of the 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, many believe that Mitt Romney's loss marked the end of his political career. However, one individual argues that Romney could potentially mount a successful comeback in 2016, citing three major moments from the 2012 election and a few philosophical adjustments.\n\nThe first point of contention is the response to Hurricane Sandy. The individual suggests that Romney should have visited areas affected by the storm, such as New York, Staten Island, Long Island, and New Jersey, to survey the damage, provide aid, and deliver a major policy speech on rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. This, they argue, would have showcased Romney's leadership and empathy, potentially turning the tide of the election.\n\nThe second point revolves around the second presidential debate, during which Romney was criticized for his response to the Benghazi attack. The individual contends that Romney should have seized the opportunity to challenge President Obama's account of the events, rather than appearing defensive.\n\nThe third point is the perceived tone-deafness of the Republican Party and its candidates, particularly in relation to cultural issues such as global warming, the environment, and alternative energy. The individual argues that Romney, if advised correctly and embracing the cultural zeitgeist, could emerge as a Reagan-like figure.\n\nIt is important to note that this article represents the opinion of one individual and does not necessarily reflect the views of all who supported Mitt Romney or the Republican Party during the 2012 election. The article does not provide any quantitative data or polling information to support its claims, and it is unclear whether these suggestions would have significantly altered the outcome of the 2012 election.\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Proposes Alternative to ObamaCare, Seeks Federal Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed a plan aimed at providing an alternative to the problems associated with ObamaCare. The plan, if approved, would allow Wisconsin's poor and uninsured individuals to purchase health coverage directly from insurers, bypassing the online \"exchange\" established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThe proposal, which has garnered support in the Wisconsin state house, was passed by the assembly with a majority, with six Democrats crossing party lines in support. However, the plan requires the approval of the Obama administration before it can take effect.\n\nGovernor Walker stated, \"If they [the Obama administration] don't approve this, this is ultimately exposing that this is not really about access and this is not about affordability. It's about government playing a heavier hand in these kinds of decisions.\"\n\nPresident Obama has criticized Republicans for complaining about health care issues without offering solutions. In a White House speech on Dec. 3, he said, \"They [Republicans] haven't presented an alternative. If you ask many of the opponents of this law what exactly they'd do differently, their answer seems to be, well, let's go back to the way things used to be.\"\n\nHowever, a number of Republican politicians have proposed alternatives to the ACA, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Senator Tom Price of Georgia, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. These Republican plans are generally consumer-driven, according to Ed Haislmaier of The Heritage Group, a conservative think tank.\n\n\"The patient makes choices,\" says Haislmaier, contrasting the consumer-driven plan with a government-driven plan in which a third party buys coverage to fit the needs of the consumer.\n\nSupporters of the president's plan argue that conservative counter-proposals lack the reach of the ACA. Economist Jonathan Gruber stated, \"I've yet to hear a Republican alternative which covers nearly as many uninsured or even half as many uninsured, or offers evidence-based solutions to the health care cost crisis.\"",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee to Vote on Subpoenas for Mueller Report and Witnesses\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has announced plans to vote on subpoenas this week, seeking the full, unredacted Russia report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller and related documents from several of President Donald Trump's former top advisers. The move comes as Democrats and the Justice Department continue to dispute the level of access to the report.\n\nThe committee, chaired by Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), will vote on subpoenas on Wednesday. The vote would not automatically issue subpoenas but authorize Nadler to send them if he decides to do so.\n\nNadler stated, \"As I have made clear, Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence.\" He added, \"Attorney General Barr has thus far indicated he will not meet the April 2 deadline set by myself and five other committee chairs, and refused to work with us to provide the full report, without redactions, to Congress.\"\n\nThe committee will also authorize subpoenas related to a number of President Trump's former top advisers, including Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, Reince Priebus, Donald McGahn, and Ann Donaldson. These individuals were key witnesses in Mueller's probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month.\n\nNadler expressed concern about reports that documents relevant to Mueller's investigation \"were sent outside the White House,\" potentially waiving executive privilege rights that would block document production. He stated, \"To this end, I have asked the committee to authorize me to issue subpoenas, if necessary, to compel the production of documents and testimony.\"\n\nNadler sent requests to 81 people connected to Trump's political and personal dealings as he launched a wide-ranging investigation into possible obstruction of justice, public corruption, and abuses of power.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, in a letter on Friday, stated that he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material, in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that \"would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\"\n\nDemocrats say they want all of that information, even if some of it cannot be disclosed to the public. They are citing precedents from previous investigations involving presidents and information disclosed about the Russia investigation to Republicans last year when they held the House majority.\n\nIf the committee does issue subpoenas, the path forward is uncertain. If the administration decides to fight, lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena\u2014a fight that could, in theory, reach the Supreme Court. Generally, such disputes are instead resolved through negotiations.\n\nThe Democrats could also formally ask Mueller to send the Judiciary committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, backed by the majority of her caucus, has said she is not currently supportive of impeachment.\n\nBarr wrote in his summary that the special counsel did not find that Trump's campaign \"conspired or coordinated\" with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. He also stated that Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation, instead setting out \"evidence on both sides\" of the question.\n\nBarr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter, declaring that Mueller's evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe.\n\nDemocrats say they want to know much more about both conclusions and they want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary committee, stated, \"Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not, in truth, require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department.\"",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Debate to Take Place Tonight in Manchester, New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nThe next Republican presidential debate is scheduled for tonight at St. Anselm's College Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire. The debate will be broadcast on ABC, with coverage beginning at 8 pm Eastern. A live stream of the event can be viewed online at ABCNews.go.com.\n\nAfter skipping the last GOP debate and losing the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump has announced his attendance at this debate. Joining Trump will be Iowa caucus winner Ted Cruz and Iowa \"media winner\" Marco Rubio, whose competitive performance in the caucuses has boosted his chances of winning the nomination in the eyes of political elites. Ben Carson, who finished fourth in Iowa and whose campaign has been in decline for months, will also be present, although his campaign appears to be nearing its end.\n\nIn addition to these candidates, there are three others\u2014Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Chris Christie\u2014who are hoping for a strong performance in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary to keep their campaigns alive. Bush, Kasich, and Christie, who are all considered establishment-friendly candidates, are viewed as rivals to Rubio, who performed better than them in Iowa. Expect these candidates to make a final effort to undermine Rubio during tonight's debate.\n\nConversely, the debate offers Rubio a significant opportunity to outshine his establishment rivals before the New Hampshire primary. If Rubio outperforms Bush, Kasich, and Christie in the Granite State, they are likely to exit the race soon, paving the way for Rubio to emerge as the mainstream Republican alternative to Trump and Cruz. If Rubio falters in New Hampshire, however, the race may remain uncertain for a while longer.\n\nSince the GOP field has narrowed, there will be no undercard debate for candidates who are not polling as well this time around. Unfortunately, Carly Fiorina missed ABC's polling cutoff to qualify for this debate, making her and former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore the two remaining candidates who will be excluded.",
    " Title: The Impact of Individual Voting in the U.S. Electoral College System\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent encounter, an American expressed support for Hillary Clinton for president despite his libertarian leanings. This individual, residing in South Carolina, acknowledged that his vote would not significantly impact the presidential race outcome due to the U.S. Electoral College system.\n\nThe Electoral College, a unique aspect of the American electoral system, determines the president based on a state-by-state tally of electoral votes rather than a national popular vote. In the closest state presidential election of the last half-century, New Mexico in 2000, the final margin for Al Gore was 366 votes, and this did not swing the national prize.\n\nIndividual influence on state-level electoral outcomes is highly unlikely. In the most recent election forecast, FiveThirtyEight estimates that Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin have the highest chances of determining the election, with Florida having a 17.9% chance, followed by Ohio and Pennsylvania with 11.5% each, Michigan at 8.7%, and Wisconsin at 6.2%. When accounting for North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Georgia, Nevada, and Iowa, all with an estimated 2% chance or less, the probability that an individual's vote will determine the outcome is virtually zero.\n\nLiving in a red or blue state, where one's vote will not swing the election, removes one from the loop. This reality is not lost on the general public, which tends to vote for third parties more often in one-party states. Citizens recognize that they are not casting the deciding national vote but are fulfilling their patriotic duty and taking pride in exercising their right to vote.\n\nThe consequence of individual presidential votes is so unlikely that Americans invest less in researching their choice than the effort they put into selecting a smartphone data plan or their next Pok\u00e9mon Go venue. This phenomenon is known as \"rational ignorance.\"\n\nVoting third party is often perceived as \"throwing your vote away.\" However, living in a non-swing state can be seen as throwing one's vote away. One tactic to recapture some modicum of vote value is to pad the total for an upstart candidate. Additionally, supporting a third party can help put the system on notice that the Big Two political party choices are being rejected.\n\nIn this year's campaign, the presidential choices from the major parties are highly undesirable for some voters. Voting for a third party, such as the Libertarian Party, with an exceedingly slim chance of victory, can be the least complicated choice for those who feel this way. This allows voters to exercise their conscience without taking responsibility for the outcome.",

The event, which was initially scheduled for a rollout of Trump's vice presidential pick, was ultimately unceremoniously announced on Twitter.\n\nTrump, in a 30-minute address, focused on criticizing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and commenting on recent global conflicts, including the attempted military coup in Turkey. He praised the Turks, stating, \"Great people, amazing people. We wish them well. A lot of anguish last night, but hopefully, it'll all work out.\"\n\nThe event, which took place in the same location where Ronald Reagan announced his 1980 presidential bid, was filled with pomp and circumstance, reminiscent of a man meeting a mail-order spouse. Trump stated, \"Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice,\" despite reportedly struggling to choose between an establishment-pleasing pick and two men with whom he has a better rapport.\n\nPence, a disciplined, conservative Republican with close-cropped white hair and a strong mandible, represented a stark contrast to Trump. He read from prepared remarks, with designated moments for applause, and addressed policy differences that have played out on social media.\n\nPence told the crowd that Trump had called him with the decision on Wednesday night, which runs counter to the narrative Trump presented to the media on Thursday, during which time he proclaimed he hadn't made his \"final, final decision.\"\n\nTheir policy differences have been evident, with Pence tweeting his support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2014, something that Trump is adamantly against. In December 2015, Pence tweeted, \"Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional,\" in response to an initial proposal from Trump that the United States place a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the country after the attack in San Bernardino. However, during his first interview as Trump's vice presidential pick, Pence expressed support for Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represent a threat to the United States.\n\nThe official union of the two men has had a somewhat rocky start, with Pence making a less-than-enthusiastic endorsement of Senator Ted Cruz ahead of the Indiana primary. Their policy differences have been evident on social media, with Pence tweeting his support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2014, something that Trump is adamantly against.

A winning ticket!\" Michael Caputo, an adviser who resigned from Trump's campaign last month, echoed Stone's remarks, stating, \"Pence's speech was solid, exceptionally well-written and delivered expertly. I think he made perfectly clear what he can do for this ticket. His speech was a rousing call to arms for Republicans and a full-volume defense of Donald Trump. Mission accomplished.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Vote to Cancel Obama's Deportation Amnesties, Sparking Political Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly charged political and constitutional debate, the House of Representatives voted Thursday to repeal President Barack Obama's deportation amnesties, a move that House Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, described as an attempt to rectify an executive overreach that undermines the rule of law and the Constitution.\n\nDuring the debate, Boehner read 22 quotes from Obama denying he had the power to act unilaterally to halt deportations. The president exercised these powers last year when he announced an amnesty for over 4 million illegal immigrants, granting them temporary legal status and work permits.\n\n\"We do not take this action lightly, but there is simply no alternative,\" Boehner said from the House floor. \"This is not a dispute between parties, or even branches of government. The president\u2019s overreach is an affront to the rule of law and the Constitution itself.\"\n\nDemocrats, equally vigorous in their defense of Obama, accused Republicans of mean-spiritedness with a series of votes to roll back Obama's November amnesty and a smaller 2012 amnesty for Dreamers, or young adults brought to the U.S. as children.\n\n\"As a country, we\u2019re better than this. Shame on you,\" said Rep. Linda T. Sanchez of California, chairwoman of the House Hispanic Caucus.\n\nThe vote to cancel the November amnesty was 237-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. The vote to cancel the amnesty for Dreamers was less popular, passing on a 218-209 vote with 26 Republicans joining all Democrats in opposition.\n\nWhite House officials and immigrant rights advocates feared the votes could send illegal immigrants back into the shadows. However, Cecilia Munoz, Obama's domestic policy director, said the White House will make it clear to illegal immigrants that the president won't be deterred.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are confident we are going to be implementing these executive actions,\" she said.\n\nThe courts could have the final say, as several challenges have been filed, including one in Texas, where 25 states have sued, arguing that they will have to fund billions of dollars worth of services to illegal immigrants if the president's plans are allowed to stand. A judge will hold a hearing Thursday on the states' request for an injunction.\n\nWednesday's fight was part of the debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security Department and its immigration enforcement mission through the end of the fiscal year. That bill cleared the House on a 236-191 vote.\n\nObama has vowed to veto the bill because it includes provisions canceling his amnesties, and Senate Democratic leaders said they will lead a filibuster to prevent the bill from even reaching the president's desk. This would leave homeland security funding in limbo, with a Feb. 27 deadline looming.\n\nRank-and-file House Republicans acknowledged Wednesday that they aren't sure about the next step. \"I don\u2019t know that there is a Plan B,\" said Rep. Peter T. King, a New York Republican who voted for the amendment to cancel the November amnesty but against the plan to scrap the Dreamer amnesty. \"It\u2019s a work in progress.\"\n\nMr. King said there are six weeks to go before the deadline, which gives all sides a chance to work out an agreement. House and Senate Republicans will gather Thursday and Friday in Pennsylvania for a policy retreat, where immigration is bound to take up much of the discussion.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who opposed both amnesty amendments, said the effort was a waste because Republicans don't have the votes to override a presidential veto.\n\n\"I wish that wasn\u2019t the case. I wish President Obama was not in the White House. But that\u2019s the reality,\" he said.\n\nAll sides said Wednesday's votes were momentous political statements and served as a signal of how much the immigration debate has changed over the past year. House Republicans entered their annual policy retreat last year with Boehner announcing principles for tackling immigration, including legalizing the Dreamers and figuring out a solution for the rest of the illegal immigrant population. This year, Boehner led the charge to cancel the amnesty for Dreamers and to step up enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nRepublicans said the moves should be seen as statements on the Constitution and separation of powers, not as attacks on immigrants. Democrats, however, said Hispanic voters won't see it that way.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been a staunch advocate for legalizing illegal immigrants, chided Republicans for backtracking on Boehner's stance to legalize Dreamers.\n\n\"One year later, you want to take away from 600,000 Dreamers their right to live in this country. What happened? What happened?\" Mr. Gutierrez said.\n\nHe vowed to make sure Hispanic voters punish Republicans for the votes: \"The fruits of your action today will ultimately anger and outrage and [ mobilize ] the immigrant community throughout this nation.\"\n\nDemocrats pointed to missives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the AFL-CIO, and Hispanic rights groups who all blasted the amendments. The bishops said deporting illegal immigrants would fracture families, and labor unions said the moves were \"anti-immigrant.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in August, Unemployment Rate Decreases Due to Labor Force Exit\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. labor market showed a slowdown in job growth last month, with the economy adding 96,000 jobs in August, according to the Department of Labor's report released on Friday. This figure is a decrease from the 141,000 jobs added in July.\n\nSimultaneously, the unemployment rate fell to 8.1%, down from 8.3% in July. Economists polled by CNNMoney had expected 120,000 jobs to be added in August, and the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.\n\nThe decrease in the unemployment rate is primarily attributed to 368,000 people leaving the workforce, many of whom are young people. The labor force participation rate, which represents the percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment, fell to 63.5%. This is a 30-year low.\n\nJoseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, commented, \"These numbers are not very strong. The job market is improving, but only gradually.\" At least 150,000 jobs need to be created each month to simply keep pace with the growing population.\n\nIn addition to the large number of people leaving the workforce, LaVorgna identified two other disappointing signs: the number of hours people worked remained flat, and wages were stagnant.\n\nThe Labor Department also revised down the job numbers for the two previous months, resulting in 41,000 fewer jobs created than originally reported.\n\nScott Brown, chief economist at the investment management firm Raymond James, stated, \"We're not losing jobs.\"\n\nEmployment in restaurants and bars increased by 28,000, a sign that people may have more disposable income. Professional and technical service jobs rose by 27,000, and the health care industry added 17,000 jobs.\n\nHowever, August was particularly hard on the manufacturing sector, which shed 15,000 jobs, and the government sector, which lost another 7,000 positions.\n\nWith two months remaining before the election, the jobs numbers have become a talking point for both campaigns. The weak numbers could also increase the chances that the Federal Reserve will take more action to boost the struggling economy.\n\nThe overall job market still has a long way to go to recover from the financial crisis. Three years after the recession ended, roughly 12.5 million Americans remain unemployed, and 40% of them have been so for six months or more.",
    " Title: NLRB's Position on Small Bargaining Units Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has come under scrutiny for its stance on small bargaining units, with critics arguing that the Board's position could lead to an undue proliferation of such units. The controversy stems from a brief filed by Acting General Counsel Lafe Solomon to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in which the NLRB stated that employers' concerns about the multiplicity of small bargaining units being detrimental to their operations are \"irrelevant\" under U.S. labor law.\n\nThe NLRB's position was presented in defense of the Obama Board's highly controversial decision, Specialty Healthcare, which overturned 76 years of Board law by allowing unions to represent bargaining units of as few as two or more employees doing the same job in the same location. The Board's decision has been criticized for threatening an undue proliferation of bargaining units, a concern that has been voiced by Congress, state labor boards, and other nations for years.\n\nSince its inception in 1936, the NLRB has recognized the potential negative effects of an undue proliferation of bargaining units, citing unnecessary work stoppages and inconsistency with the long-term goals of collective bargaining. During Senate debate in 1974 on extending the Board's jurisdiction to cover non-profit health care institutions, Senator Harrison A. Williams (D-NJ) acknowledged the Board's efforts to avoid unnecessary proliferation.\n\nIn 1989, the NLRB proposed adopting a rule that would make a single facility unit presumptively appropriate, citing concerns over disproportionate, unjustified costs and undue proliferation of units. Congress has also consistently taken a position against undue proliferation, cautioning the NLRB against creating unnecessary work stoppages and threatening patient care in the non-profit health care industry.\n\nThe NLRB's brief draws from Congress's caution the preposterous conclusion that a multiplicity of bargaining units in all other industries is an \"irrelevant\" consideration under U.S. labor law. This conclusion has been met with criticism, as it contradicts Congress's admonition to the Board and the long-standing position of the NLRB.\n\nLabor boards in other jurisdictions, such as Illinois and Canada, also recognize the dangers of micro-unions and seek to avoid them. The Ontario Labor Relations Board (OLRB) has stated that the proliferation of bargaining units is not conducive to collective bargaining stability, citing unnecessary work stoppages, impeded employee movement between jobs, jurisdictional disputes, and the costs of negotiating and applying multiple collective agreements.\n\nThe political leadership at the NLRB reflects the priorities of the President who appointed it. The same Acting General Counsel whose office authored this brief filed a lawsuit to stop The Boeing Company from building new Dreamliner aircraft in a $1 billion plant in South Carolina. The same NLRB that authorized micro-unions has issued decisions that have radically changed Board law to benefit unions without regard for their impact on workers and businesses, creating uncertainty and contributing to a chill on job creation.",
    " Title: President Obama Remains Optimistic on Public Perception of Obamacare Despite Unfavorable Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, President Barack Obama expressed his belief that public opinion on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, will improve as the law is implemented. Despite polls indicating that the majority of Americans dislike the health care policy, Obama suggested that once individuals are required to purchase health insurance or face a penalty, they will come to appreciate the law.\n\nHowever, the President acknowledged the challenges in changing public opinion, stating, \"But until then, when we\u2019re getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, we\u2019re going to continue to have some polls like that.\" He further explained, \"Me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself won\u2019t do it. The test of this is going to be is it working. And if it works, it will be pretty darn popular.\"\n\nDespite a new public relations push, the President's optimism regarding winning over public opinion appears to be unrealistic, according to the article. Obama suggested that as people sign up for health insurance and the law functions effectively, its popularity will increase. He stated, \"Over the course of six months to a year, as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the'sky is falling' predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular.\"\n\nThe President's comments suggest a disconnect with the public's perception of Obamacare, as many Americans are aware of the potential implications of the policy. The article concludes without offering a definitive prediction on the future popularity of the Affordable Care Act.",
    " Title: ObamaCare Enrollment Data Shows High Number of Previously Insured Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe majority of the more than 2 million Americans who signed up for health insurance under ObamaCare through the end of December were already enrolled in employer-sponsored plans or had previously bought their own coverage, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Early data from insurers, brokers, and consultants suggest that the marketplaces are popular with consumers who were previously covered elsewhere, raising questions about the law's effectiveness in expanding coverage to millions of uninsured Americans.\n\nA survey by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. found that only 11 percent of consumers who purchased new coverage under ObamaCare were previously uninsured. The survey was based on a sampling of 4,563 consumers between November and January.\n\nHealthMarkets Inc., an insurance agency that signed up about 7,500 people in exchange plans, reported that 65 of its enrollees had prior coverage. Fifteen percent of enrollees had their individual plans canceled, and 40 percent switched over from previous individual plans.\n\nDavid M. Cordani, chief executive of insurer Cigna, told The Wall Street Journal that one of the intents of the law was to address the uninsured problem in the country. However, some insurers said the early data on newly insured consumers is falling short of expectations.\n\nInsurers in Michigan expected 400,000 of the state's 1.2 million uninsured people to join private plans this year, according to an analysis provided by Michigan-based Priority Health. As of the end of December, only 76,000 people had signed up, many of whom were previously covered, according to the report.\n\nGeoff Bartsh, vice president for policy at Minneapolis-based Medica Health Plans, told The Journal, \"I don't know we're growing the number of people with insurance here, so much as we're just adding complexity.\"\n\nFederal health officials told The Journal they do not yet know the number of people who have signed up for coverage through the exchanges who had insurance when they enrolled. Consumers have until the end of March 31 to purchase plans under ObamaCare.\n\nAaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, \"We are in the middle of a sustained six-month open-enrollment period, and we have seen a strong interest in the product overall across the range of demographics so far. We are ramping up outreach activities so that more Americans learn how they can now benefit from affordable health insurance.\"\n\nOverall, adults ages 55-64 were the most heavily represented in the signups, accounting for 33 percent of the total. Nationwide, the premiums paid by people in that demographic do not fully cover their medical expenses. Some are in the waiting room for Medicare, which starts at age 65.\n\nYoung adults from 18 to 34 are only 24 percent of total enrollment, according to the Obama administration's first signup figures broken down for age, gender, and other details. Enrolling young and healthy people is important because they generally pay more into the system than they take out, subsidizing older adults.",
    " Title: Democratic Lawmakers Call for Gun Control Measures Following School Shooting in Connecticut\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the school shootings in Connecticut, several Democratic lawmakers and Independent Senator Joe Lieberman have called for a renewed discussion on gun control and mental health policies. The recent spate of mass shootings has prompted these politicians to revisit the issue of gun control, which was a hot topic in the early 1990s when Congress enacted a 10-year ban on assault weapons. However, since the ban expired in 2004, few Americans have shown support for stricter gun laws, with politicians citing pressure from the powerful gun-rights lobby.\n\nGun-rights advocates have remained largely quiet on the issue since the shooting that killed 20 children aged 6 or 7. The gunman, Adam Lanza, was reportedly carrying an arsenal of ammunition and used a high-powered rifle similar to the military's M-16.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, has been the most prominent gun rights advocate to speak after the shooting. Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat, has expressed support for gun policy discussions and moving toward action on gun regulation. He agrees with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has advocated banning the sale of assault weapons.\n\nPresident Barack Obama did not specifically address gun control during a Sunday night service in Newtown, Connecticut, but vowed to engage citizens in an effort to prevent future tragedies. He also questioned whether the nation is prepared to accept such violence as the price of freedom.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., stated that the nation could be at a \"tipping point\" for gun control, with the potential for significant action. He and other Democrats, as well as Senator Joe Lieberman, have proposed banning the sale of new assault weapons and making it more difficult for mentally ill individuals to obtain weapons. Lieberman also suggested creating a new commission to examine gun laws, the mental health system, and the role of violence in media.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has announced plans to introduce legislation next year to ban new assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. She believes that reinstating the ban, despite opposition from the National Rifle Association and similar groups, is achievable.\n\nMayor Bloomberg has suggested that President Obama could use executive powers to enforce existing gun laws and support legislation like Senator Feinstein's.\n\nGun-rights activists have been largely absent from the discussion since the shooting, with only Representative Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, appearing on various Sunday talk shows. Gohmert defended the sale of assault weapons and argued that violence is lower in cities with lax gun laws and higher in cities with stricter laws.\n\nGun-control advocates dispute this claim, citing a study by the California-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence that found that states with the strongest gun laws have some of the lowest gun death rates.\n\nIn response to the shooting, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has called for increased funding for mental health services, universal background checks, and a ban on high-capacity magazines and assault weapons. The organization also advocates for the implementation of red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to temporarily seize firearms from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others.",
    " Title: Synagogue Shooting in Southern California: One Dead, Several Injured\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - A shooting at a synagogue near San Diego, California, on Saturday has left one dead and several injured. The attack occurred at the Chabad of Poway synagogue, and the suspect, 19-year-old John T. Earnest, has been arrested and charged with murder.\n\nRabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who was present during the attack, described the incident as \"unfathomable.\" He stated, \"I faced death face to face.\" The youngest victim was eight-year-old Noya Duhan, who had recently moved from southern Israel, where her village was subject to rocket attacks from Gaza. The lone fatality was 60-year-old Laurie Kaye. Friends say Kaye stepped in front of the rabbi to stop Earnest.\n\nAn off-duty border patrol agent, Oscar Stewart, described his actions during the incident. \"He dropped his weapon and he ran out of the sanctuary,\" Stewart said, referring to Earnest. Stewart also opened fire as Earnest drove away. Police eventually arrested Earnest about a mile from the synagogue.\n\nIn an open letter posted online under Earnest's name, he expressed a desire to kill Jews and praised the gunmen accused in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and recent mosque attacks in New Zealand. Police also suspect Earnest's involvement in an arson attack at a California mosque.\n\nPresident Trump called Rabbi Goldstein to offer his condolences and condemned the shooting at a weekend rally in Wisconsin. \"We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate which must be defeated,\" said Trump.\n\nFollowing backlash, the New York Times retracted a controversial cartoon published in its international edition that was criticized for containing anti-Semitic tropes. The World Jewish Congress called out the New York Times for the cartoon, stating, \"The @nytimes has crossed a red line today by publishing a cartoon infused with anti-Semitic tropes.\"\n\nMichael Rydelnik, an expert on anti-Semitism at the Moody Bible Institute, commented on the rise of anti-Semitism, stating, \"It's like a contagious disease that always under the surface and sometimes it spurs up into epidemic proportions and then sometimes it recedes.\"\n\nEarnest is expected to face federal hate crime charges in addition to the murder charge.",
    " Title: Pelosi-Trump Tensions Escalate as Shutdown Continues, Security Concerns Arise in Congressional Trip Cancellation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown has led to a significant escalation in tensions between President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as the debate over border security continues. Democrats are reportedly acknowledging that they have allowed the President to define the terms of the debate, and are now working to articulate their own position more effectively.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, stated, \"People want to make sure that it's clear that the Democrats do stand for border security, and not allow the president to determine how we talk about it. We can't cave to his vision for a wall, because of everything that it represents, but we also want to show that we're for something.\"\n\nThe issue arose during a meeting of the Democratic caucus this week, where Speaker Pelosi briefed rank-and-file lawmakers about her latest criticism of Mr. Trump over the shutdown. This included a letter requesting that he delay or cancel his State of the Union address this month due to the security measures that would have to be provided by federal workers working without pay.\n\nIn response, Mr. Trump prevented Ms. Pelosi from using a military plane for her trip. His letter announcing this step also disclosed her itinerary, which was kept confidential for security reasons, particularly when it involves travel to war zones and high-ranking leaders like the speaker, who is second in line to the presidency.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi addressed reporters at the Capitol, stating, \"You never give advance notice of going into a battle area \u2014 you just never do.\" She added, \"The people around him, though, should have known that. That's very dangerous.\"\n\nAfter Speaker Pelosi rushed to salvage the trip by making alternative travel arrangements to fly commercial, her plans were revealed to reporters by people close to Mr. Trump who had been briefed. By dawn on Friday, facing a heightened State Department threat assessment and amid concern that the administration's leaks had further compromised the safety of those involved, Ms. Pelosi canceled the trip.\n\nA White House official on Friday denied the charge, stating that there was no way for Ms. Pelosi to have kept her trip a secret and that any suggestion of a leak \"is a flat-out lie.\"",
    " Title: Obama and Pena Nieto to Discuss Immigration and Security Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Tuesday at the White House to discuss immigration and border security. The meeting's agenda includes finding ways to prevent a surge of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and minimizing the number of people attempting the dangerous journey.\n\nThe discussion will focus on Obama's immigration action and border security. The senior administration official stated that illegal immigrants already in the U.S. who aid their relatives in crossing the border will not be eligible for Obama's new deportation amnesty. Mexican consulates will play a key role in informing Mexican immigrants about who qualifies and who does not qualify for the executive actions.\n\nHomeland Security and State Department officials are collaborating on a campaign to deter would-be illegal immigrants. The surge of child immigrants in 2014, despite Obama's action, led to an increase in illegal immigration last year. Before 2014, illegal immigration had been on a downward trend due to the economic slump and tightened enforcement.\n\nThe administration official reported that the U.S. has made significant progress in strengthening the border with Mexico, with Pena Nieto being an \"important partner\" in helping to stem the flow of illegal child immigrants last year. The official also stated that the number of illegal immigrants entering the country is at a historical low, with the last comparable numbers seen in the 1970s.\n\nIn addition to immigration and security issues, the leaders are expected to discuss other matters, including the ongoing drug wars and the embattled Mexican president's handling of the massacre of 43 students in Iguala in September. Human Rights Watch has urged Obama to press Pena Nieto to investigate and prosecute abuses by Mexican security forces.\n\nThe White House stated that the two leaders will emphasize the importance of expanding dialogue and cooperation between the United States and Mexico on economic, security, and social issues, as well as underscoring the deep cultural ties and friendship between the two countries.",
    " Title: Obama Demonstrates Skill in State of the Union Address, Yet Challenges Persist in Policy Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in his latest State of the Union address, displayed a deft hand in his delivery, as he navigated a speech that was not dominated by a strong hand or a clear disadvantage. The speech came amidst a backdrop of low approval ratings, a dismal national mood, and a series of political and policy setbacks.\n\nIn the lead-up to the speech, the president's approval rating was underwater, and the national mood was decidedly downbeat. Macroeconomic improvements seemed to have little impact on personal levels, and the \"right-direction-wrong-track\" poll question was negative. The speech followed a string of negative headlines, including the failure of gun control measures in the Senate, the stalling of immigration changes in the House, and revelations of government surveillance and data-gathering, all culminating in the rocky rollout of Obamacare.\n\nOn the foreign front, potential breakthroughs with Iran were overshadowed by civil war in Syria, the quagmire in Afghanistan, and renewed unrest in Iraq, Egypt, and South Sudan. However, the embattled president was not without cards to play on this night. Congress, with an even deeper trough in its public approval, bore the brunt of the opprobrium for the federal government's partial shutdown in October.\n\nPolls showed strong public support for a higher minimum wage, extended benefits for the long-term unemployed, and new rules on immigration - precisely the policy fronts on which the president planned to press forward against strong Republican resistance. In other words, neither party came to this year's State of the Union table in a dominant position, though there surely were partisans on either side who thought they did.\n\nIn the media, many stressed the long fall the president had taken since his emergence as an almost magical persona in the presidential primaries six years ago. Now the cable TV stories asked: \"Is Obama already a lame duck?\" Yet most were quick to add that the GOP was hobbled by miscues and was so riven with factional debate that the official party response to the State of the Union (by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers) was followed by two separate Tea Party retorts (by Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul).\n\nGiven this downbeat context, and noting the chief executive's rather lackluster public performances in recent months, expectations for this State of the Union were not nearly so high as they were last year. Then, the president was fresh off his re-election, replete with vindication and seeking fresh worlds to conquer. That contrast may have helped the president, who seemed to draw a kind of inspiration Tuesday night from the uninspiring circumstances of the moment.\n\nFor purposes of his one-hour address to the nation, the president once again proved himself a gamer. He was brisk and confident, the master of a text that was in preparation since November. Having telegraphed for days his intended emphasis on \"income inequality,\" the president tacked slightly by talking instead of \"inequality of opportunity.\" This caught Rodgers slightly off-guard. Her text was already written to say that opportunity was the important thing, not income. It's a subtle point, perhaps, but one that afforded the president a slight edge (and demonstrated again why it is better to be the king than the king's critic).\n\nObama also managed to avoid a remarkable, even breathtaking array of issues one might have thought he had to deal with. He declared Obamacare to be more successful than most people think, and really, how high a bar is that? He also slid past the National Security Agency scandal that has cost him dearly on the left, and he made no mention of the deportations that have so angered immigrants' rights groups.\n\nYes, he touched the various constituency buttons on issues such as climate change and environmental damage. And yes, he once again gave primacy to revamping the immigration laws. But here, as elsewhere in the speech, he showed deference to House Speaker John Boehner. Obama seemed to suggest he was still willing to deal with the Republican from Ohio, especially if Boehner is able to keep his often-unruly troops in line. The president implicitly saluted Boehner for doing so on the federal budget compromise vote in December.\n\nIn sum, the Obama who delivered the speech was a nimble and adaptable player. It is the tragedy of this presidency that, to date, he has not been nearly as adept at the less-dramatic business of actually dealing with the Congress, the federal bureaucracy, the media, or any of other power centers - including foreign governments.\n\nThe president has, in recent weeks, added new staff in critical positions, including senior adviser John Podesta, who is a veteran of Bill Clinton's later years in the White House, and new faces in the legislative affairs office. There is some cause for hope that these new players will help the president extend his talent for presentation to produce more successes in policymaking.",
    " Title: Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger Found Guilty of Murder in Death of Botham Jean\n\nFormer Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was found guilty of murder on Tuesday, according to The Dallas Morning News. The verdict came in the trial for the death of Botham Jean, who was killed in his own apartment by Guyger on Sept. 6, 2018.\n\nThe facts of the case were largely uncontested, but the verdict hinged on the interpretation of the \"Castle Doctrine,\" which allows for the use of deadly force when one is threatened in one's own home.\n\nOn the evening of Sept. 6, an off-duty Guyger, who was returning home after a long shift, mistakenly entered Jean's fourth-floor apartment, which was directly above her own. Finding the door unlocked, she shot the 26-year-old accountant, who was eating a bowl of ice cream, because she assumed he was an intruder.\n\nGuyger was initially arrested on a manslaughter charge, which was later upgraded to a murder charge after review from the district attorney's office. She spoke publicly on the incident for the first time when she took the stand as the first witness for the defense last Friday.\n\n\"I was scared whoever was inside of my apartment was going to kill me, and I'm sorry,\" Guyger said as she cried, her voice shaking. \"I have to live with that every single day.\" Her defense centered around her making a tragic but honest mistake.\n\nThe lead investigator on the case, Texas Ranger David Armstrong, testified that in interviewing 297 of the 349 residents at the South Side Flats apartment complex where Guyger and Jean lived, 46 had accidentally entered the wrong floor and put their key in the door. Of those 46, 38 were from the third and fourth floors.\n\nProsecutors argued that Guyger acted rashly in her use of deadly force by not calling for backup and that she missed several signs she was on the wrong floor because she was distracted by sexually explicit messages from a fellow police officer with whom she was having an extramarital affair.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced, attorneys for the Jean family held an impromptu press conference to praise the decision. Attorney Ben Crump said 26-year-old Jean was a \"near perfect\" person, and that \"it shouldn't take all of [Jean's credentials] for unarmed black and brown people in America to get justice.\"\n\n\"This verdict is for Trayvon Martin, it's for Michael Brown, it's for Sandra Bland, it's for Tamir Rice, it's for Eric Garner, it's for Antwon Rose, it's for Jemel Roberson, for EJ Bradford, for Stephon Clark, for Jeffrey Dennis, Genevieve Dawes, for Pamela Turner,\" Crump said.\n\nJean's mother rejoiced as cheers broke out outside the courtroom when the verdict was announced soon after 10:30 a.m. \"God is good. Trust him,\" she said. Guyger remained standing until the jury left after announcing the decision, then fell into her chair.",
    " Title: Dallas Jury Convicts Former Police Officer Amber Guyger of Murder in Shooting of Botham Jean\n\nArticle:\n\nA Dallas jury has convicted former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger of murder after she mistakenly entered the wrong apartment and shot dead its rightful occupant, Botham Jean, on October 1, 2019. The verdict came despite a jury instruction that allowed Guyger to argue the \"Castle Doctrine\" could apply to her actions.\n\nUnder the Castle Doctrine, the use of force is presumed reasonable if another person is \"unlawfully and with force entering or attempting to enter your occupied home, car, or place of business.\" However, in this case, Guyger was the armed person unlawfully entering Jean's home. Jean had the right to shoot Guyger, while she had no right to shoot him.\n\nThe jury's verdict is significant, not just because justice was served in this tragic case, but also because it may signal a shift in some jurisdictions' interpretation of the \"reasonable\" use of force by police officers. In many jurisdictions, officers are required to show that they used deadly force based on a \"reasonable\" belief that the suspect presented a risk of inflicting deadly force or serious bodily harm. However, juries have often followed an unwritten code that virtually any expression of fear by a police officer justifies a shooting.\n\nThe jury's verdict in the Amber Guyger trial is a small data point that some juries in some jurisdictions may be rejecting this classic police defense that has been used to help officers escape accountability for unjustified shootings. In this case, Guyger attempted to use the fear defense, claiming she felt \"pure fear\" when she opened the door on a man eating ice cream on his own couch. However, her fear was not deemed reasonable, and the jury found her guilty of murder.\n\nThe jury's verdict is a vital correction to a culture that has sometimes allowed police officers to abide by a lower standard of behavior than the average citizen of the United States. The case highlights the importance of juries understanding the full scope of the risks inherent in lawful encounters when rendering verdicts, while also emphasizing the need for impartial and unbiased decision-making in the application of force by law enforcement officers.",

The incident left Davison \"terrified and traumatized\" and with bruises on her neck and arms, according to Davison and other officials for the Laxalt campaign.\n\nThe Las Vegas City Marshals arrested Stark Tuesday evening, and he remains in custody in the Las Vegas city jail. The city marshal's office stated that the arrest was classified as a citizen's arrest because the incident did not occur in the presence of the marshals. The office also noted that the incident was \"an apparent result of an altercation involving Mr. Stark entering one of the rooms... and attempting to question Attorney General Adam Laxalt.\"\n\nThis is not Stark's first arrest. Earlier this year, Stark was arrested for allegedly assaulting the female press secretary for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The latest confrontation took place after a campaign event in East Las Vegas Tuesday evening.\n\nAccording to Davison, a \"very large man,\" later identified as Stark, \"burst into the room where Adam [Laxalt] and I were talking with a camera.\" Davison stated that Stark was \"very physical\u2014pushing me, pushing into members of my staff, screaming.\"\n\nDuring the altercation, Davison said Stark grabbed her right arm, twisted it behind her back, and bruised her neck. She also stated that Stark held her head against his chest for several minutes.\n\nThe Laxalt campaign issued a statement, calling the incident \"disgusting\" and stating that \"Assaulting the female campaign manager of the opposing campaign is disgusting and it has no place in our system.\"\n\nAmerican Bridge, the political action committee for which Stark works, did not respond to a request for comment. It is unclear whether Stark was on the job for American Bridge during the confrontation. However, Stark lists himself as a reporter for the group on his LinkedIn page.\n\nStark has a record of arrests while working for American Bridge. In 2017, he was arrested for disorderly conduct at an event in Virginia while covering then-GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie. He was found guilty of disorderly conduct in February of this year. The incident with Zinke's press secretary Heather Swift occurred in March at the Longworth House Office Building after a budget hearing before a House committee. Stark allegedly approached Swift and reportedly \"used his full body to push\" Swift as she tried to leave the room. Swift, who called the incident \"terrifying,\" told police that she decided to press charges to help obtain a \"stay-away order\" against him.\n\n\"It's shocking to me that anyone in this business, no matter which party or issue you're working on, would keep someone on their payroll who has been consistently arrested for violence,\" Davison told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"This is a terrifying incident.\"\n\nAmerican Bridge was founded in November 2010 by David Brock, who also founded liberal watchdog group Media Matters. Soros is the largest donor to American Bridge, donating more than $2 million between 2015 and 2016. Soros is still involved with the group, most recently donating $300,000 in February and $80,000 last year.",
    " Title: Kavanaugh and Blasey Deliver Prepared Testimonies in Senate Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford have delivered their prepared testimonies.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh, in his prepared remarks, acknowledged his high school behavior, stating, \"I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many.\" He further admitted, \"In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now.\" However, he emphasized that the allegations against him are \"far more serious than juvenile misbehavior.\"\n\nDr. Blasey, in her prepared testimony, expressed her apprehension about coming forward, stating, \"I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified.\" She plans to tell senators, \"I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\"\n\nDr. Blasey also addressed the defense by Judge Kavanaugh and his Republican allies who have asserted that she may be misremembering the identity of her assailant. She will say that their friend groups had \"intersected\" during her freshman and sophomore years of high school and that they had attended parties together.\n\nOther significant disclosures related to Dr. Blasey's claims, such as the release of handwritten calendar notations from Judge Kavanaugh's high school days, affidavits from Dr. Blasey's friends and husband, and a copy of the polygraph test administered in August, were overshadowed by the day's continuing developments. The polygraph test indicated no deception.\n\nAllies of both Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh have submitted letters attesting to their integrity. Protesters have prepared for rallies, and shadowy threats have flooded the phone lines and inboxes of key players in the drama.",
    " Title: Fox News Anchor Shepard Smith Debunks Uranium One Allegations Against Hillary Clinton\n\nArticle:\n\nFox News anchor Shepard Smith on Tuesday evening presented a segment debunking the Uranium One allegations against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a storyline that has been a recurring theme on the network during the 2016 election campaign. The segment, which used factual information and graphics, contradicted the network's previous coverage and sparked outrage among some Fox viewers.\n\nSmith outlined the original accusations, made in a book by a journalist for the right-wing news website Breitbart, and Trump's use of these allegations to boost support during the campaign. He then systematically dismantled the claims.\n\nThe allegations centered around the sale of a Canadian company with large uranium mining interests in Wyoming to the Russian nuclear agency, and the Clinton Foundation receiving $140 million in donations from nine people involved in the business deal while Clinton was Secretary of State.\n\nHowever, Smith explained that the deal required the approval of a committee formed from the heads of nine federal government agencies, and that President Barack Obama, due to the national security implications of Russia holding any US uranium interests, had the power to block the deal under rules written during the Ronald Reagan administration. Smith also pointed out that Clinton did not intervene to approve the deal and did not have the power to approve or block it.\n\nFurthermore, Smith noted that none of the uranium mined in Wyoming by the Canadian company was exported to Russia, and the vast majority of the donations to the Clinton Foundation were made by a man who had already sold his stake in the uranium company in 2007, years before the Russian deal went through and about 18 months before Clinton became Secretary of State.\n\nDuring the report, Smith appeared to stumble over his script several times, possibly due to the segment's departure from the network's usual coverage and the political leanings of many viewers. The segment came as Attorney General Jeff Sessions is under pressure from President Trump to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the old allegations, but Sessions hinted in a congressional hearing on Tuesday that there was no basis to do so.\n\nThe segment sparked outrage among some Fox viewers, with one posting on Twitter, \"Get Shepard Smith off of Fox. He's arrogant and doing his own spin. Nobody knows how deep the left's conspiracy goes and Shepherd Smith has ZERO inside info because nobody trusts him. OUT!\"\n\nDespite the backlash, some Twitter users praised Smith's segment, with one tweeting, \"Fox News reports on Uranium One. Shepard Smith uses detailed facts & graphs to explain why there is no reason to investigate. It is a false controversy meant to draw our attention from real issues within the Trump administration.\"",
    " Title: Virginia Navigator Program Seeks $495,000 for Healthcare Enrollment Assistance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Virginia healthcare navigation program has requested $495,000, accounting for approximately a third of the total navigator funds allocated for the state. This funding would cover the equivalent of seven and a half full-time navigators, necessary equipment, informational materials, marketing, and ongoing outreach events in five counties.\n\nThe federal government initially did not anticipate covering the cost of running the insurance markets in 34 states, resulting in only $54 million in funding for navigators in these states, transferred from a fund for public health prevention programs. The healthcare law had set aside significantly more money for states that built their own markets, assuming most would do so.\n\nTo address this gap, other organizations will also contribute to outreach and enrollment efforts. Approximately 1,200 community health centers nationwide, which provide medical care for the uninsured, have received a total of $150 million in federal funds to aid with outreach and enrollment. Virginia's health centers received $2.5 million.\n\nIn addition to navigators, insurance agents or brokers, and insurance companies selling plans through the markets, will also play a role in helping people sign up for coverage. Other organizations that did not apply for navigator funds will still educate the uninsured about their options, connect them with navigators, or guide them towards the new insurance markets.\n\nNavigators, who will also assist small businesses and their employees in learning about and enrolling in health plans offered through the new markets, are prohibited from recommending specific health plans or receiving compensation from insurance companies. Navigators will undergo at least 20 hours of training and take a certification test.\n\nWith the upcoming rollout of the new insurance markets, there is a growing need for collaboration among various organizations to ensure the uninsured are informed about their options and can successfully enroll in health plans. The identities of the navigators are eagerly anticipated, as they will serve as key points of contact for other groups to partner with, refer individuals to, and strengthen outreach efforts.",
    " Title: Election 2012: Candidates Focus on Mobilizing Core Supporters Rather Than Court Undecided Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2012 presidential election, both candidates, President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, are focusing more on energizing their respective anti-Obama and anti-Romney coalitions rather than attempting to expand their voter bases with arguments about qualifications. This shift has led to a period of heightened partisanship and divisive exchanges between the candidates.\n\nPresident Obama has been responding in kind, with harsh exchanges that include mocking Romney's character and accusing him of waging a \"campaign of division and anger and hate.\" Romney, in turn, has accused Obama of disgracing the presidency.\n\nFor months, Romney attempted to make inroads among voters who were disappointed with, but not necessarily angry at, Obama. Republican groups ran television advertisements with a softer approach, encouraging voters to feel no guilt for not supporting Obama. However, after a summer of criticism from Democrats, Romney is now returning the scorching fire in an attempt to expand his support among Republicans who strongly oppose Obama.\n\nAccording to strategists from both parties, the traditional balance between motivating core supporters without scaring off independent voters may be different in this election cycle. A series of recent polls in six swing states showed that only 5 percent of voters were undecided, and only about 1 in 10 likely voters who had chosen a candidate said they were open to switching.\n\nJoel Benenson, the chief pollster for the president's re-election campaign, stated, \"There is a smaller slice of undecided voters out there than usual.\" He added, \"Republicans may think that their only chance of winning this is by maximizing their base, but I don't believe this election is a base election.\"\n\nFor Mr. Obama, there is an opportunity to capture some moderate voters who oppose the direction that Representative Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and other House Republicans have moved in. However, Mr. Obama still has to persuade some centrists that he can be trusted with the deficit and the economy and that he is not culturally out of step with them.\n\nThe strategic shifts by the candidates mirror a bigger change in the nature of the race. It is no longer solely a referendum on Obama's economic record; rather, it is a choice between approaches to the future of Medicare, the popular health insurance program for retirees, and the role and scope of government.\n\nThe Romney campaign is testing whether it can expand the successful Republican coalition from 2010, when the party, on the basis of an anti-Obama and very conservative message, won control of the House and expanded its strength at all levels of government. It is not simply a base strategy, aides said, but a plan to capitalize on the rejection of Obama's approach that they say is coursing through the country.\n\nNeil Newhouse, the pollster for Romney, stated, \"We're going to be able to make a very compelling argument to people in the middle that we need a change and Obama isn't the change they signed up for.\" He added, \"When you really probe, people are upset with spending, the deficit, and the debt. It goes beyond jobs and the economy, and there is a sense things are out of control.\"\n\nFor Mr. Romney, several benefits of selecting Ryan have already become clear. He has drawn praise from conservatives, including those who have long been tepid. And he has become a stronger and more confident campaigner with a partner at his side, advisers say, who has an easygoing style that could help improve Romney's connection to voters.\n\nThe Romney campaign is taking pains to track down and quash any criticism in Republican circles about any potential downsides of Ryan on the ticket, including that the campaign debate over Medicare is fraught with risk for other candidates in the party.\n\nInterviews with nearly a dozen Republicans on Congressional and Senate campaigns said in near unison that they worried that the economic focus of the race had been overshadowed. It is a question that may not be answered until Election Day. Will a surge of conservative enthusiasm for the Republican ticket outweigh any potential falloff among voters who supported Obama in 2008 and are open to changing their minds this year?\n\nMr. Brooks, the Iowa man who had counted himself in that category, said his mind was made up before Obama unexpectedly stopped by his table at the Pump Haus restaurant in downtown Cedar Falls on Tuesday. \"We had no idea he was showing up,\" he said. \"We really didn't talk politics.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Michael Grimm Indicted for Alleged Tax Fraud and Employment of Illegal Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nProsecutors have released a damning indictment against Representative Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent, accusing him of hiding over $1 million in revenue from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by paying employees, including illegal immigrant workers, in cash. The indictment, unveiled on Monday, includes over 20 charges related to a health food restaurant, Healthalicious, that Grimm ran from 2007-2010.\n\nLoretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, described the alleged conduct as \"breathtaking\" at a press conference and accused Rep. Grimm of \"succumbing to the allure of easy money and cheating his way to success.\" The indictment threatens Grimm's political career, as he is a sophomore lawmaker and a key moderate voice in the House Republican conference.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Grimm paid some employees exclusively in cash and others partly in cash and partly through checks. The payroll processing companies working with Rep. Grimm would only see the payments given by check, and these were the only payments reported to a number of entities: his accountant, the IRS, the State of New York, the New York State Insurance Fund, and health insurance companies.\n\nThrough an unknowing accountant, Rep. Grimm is alleged to have hidden $1.3 million in profits. This allowed him to evade both federal and state taxes, pay less for workers' compensation insurance, pay less in health insurance coverage for employees, and hire illegal immigrants, who were paid exclusively in cash.\n\nRep. Grimm kept a set of spreadsheets showing the amount of money entering and leaving the restaurant that he shared with his accountant and payroll processing companies. He kept a second set of spreadsheets that showed the true profits of the restaurant and the true salaries of all employees.\n\nUpon facing a congressional election, Grimm hired a manager to do much of the work he was once responsible for at the restaurant. This manager he communicated with through an AOL account. He sent the manager the second set of spreadsheets showing the restaurant's true profits via this account, committing wire fraud, the indictment alleges.\n\nThe indictment accuses Grimm of obstructing and impeding the due administration of the Internal Revenue Laws, aiding and assisting in the preparation of false and fraudulent tax returns, and lying under oath during a deposition for a lawsuit brought by former employees of Healthalicious who alleged they were being paid less than minimum wage.\n\nIn addition to the larger money hiding scheme, Grimm is also accused of knowingly hiring and continuing to employ workers who did not have legal residency status and accordingly did not have valid authorization to work inside the United States. As these individuals were not on the payroll, they did not receive health insurance, a crime of its own.\n\nRep. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, has accused the government of a \"politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth,\" denying the allegations.",
    " Title: Senate Fails to Repeal Obamacare, Leaving Healthcare Law in Place\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate's attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, failed on Friday, marking a significant setback for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. The vote was 51-49, with three Republican senators joining Democrats in opposition. The bill's defeat calls into question the Republican Party's ability to govern, as they control the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives.\n\nSenator John McCain, who is currently undergoing treatment for brain cancer, cast the deciding vote. McCain, along with Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, voted against the legislation, joining Senate Democrats in unison.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose reputation as a master strategist was diminished, stated on the Senate floor after the vote that it was time to move on to other matters. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, in a statement, said Republicans should not give up on healthcare but cited other pressing issues that needed attention, including major tax-cut legislation.\n\nThe Senate's healthcare failure comes as Trump has not had a major legislative victory after more than six months in office. The administration is currently mired in investigations into contacts between Trump's election campaign and Russia and high-level White House staff infighting. Trump had promised to get major healthcare legislation, tax cuts, and a boost in infrastructure spending through Congress in short order.\n\nIn addition to legislative agenda items such as spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to avoid a government shutdown and raising the U.S. debt limit, the Senate's healthcare failure also leaves health insurers unsure of how long the administration will continue to make billions of dollars in Obamacare payments that help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans.\n\nShares of health insurers, which had fought against the bill's proposed repeal of the mandate that Americans obtain insurance, were up following the vote. Hospitals, which had been concerned about big cuts in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled, saw mostly higher shares.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham met with Trump on Friday to discuss Graham's proposal to take tax money raised by Obamacare and send it back to the states in the form of healthcare block grants. Some lawmakers have urged a bipartisan effort to buttress the existing healthcare system, but it remains to be seen if a bipartisan approach can get off the ground.",
    " Title: Shift in State Immigration Policies Reflects Changing Political Climate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political climate surrounding immigration has seen a significant shift in the United States, with a decrease in the pursuit of broad immigration legislation at the state level. This change is attributed to evolving political currents and court decisions.\n\nImmigrant-rights groups are now taking a more proactive approach, with states such as Colorado granting in-state college tuition rates to illegal immigrants and Illinois issuing driver's licenses to them.\n\nArturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, commented on this shift, stating, \"There has been a general reaction by folks to the impact that the Latino vote had in November \u2014 that people are thinking twice about the actions they take. Most of these pieces of legislation had been supported by Republican legislators, and I think people are thinking twice about whether this is a strategy the party wants to pursue.\"\n\nTwo years ago, the momentum was on the opposite side, with Congress stalemated and conservative states pushing for their own immigration laws to address the costs and potential safety concerns associated with illegal immigration. Arizona, in 2007, was a pioneer in this regard, implementing a law requiring businesses to use the government's voluntary electronic worker verification system and, in 2011, passing SB 1070, a law imposing state criminal penalties for illegal immigrants and requiring police to check the status of those believed to be in the country illegally.\n\nOther states, including South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana, also passed similar laws. The Supreme Court upheld the worker verification law in 2011 and last year issued a major ruling allowing the police checks to continue, though it struck down the state criminal penalties for illegal immigration. The court also warned it could revisit the police checks if the law is implemented in a discriminatory fashion.\n\nCurrently, many states are awaiting further guidance from the courts and Congress. Ann Morse, who runs the National Conference of State Legislatures' immigrant policy project, reported that interest in immigration remains high at the state level, but there are no longer the big omnibus bills. Some states are debating new verification requirements for state services or for voting.\n\nHowever, where there is clear momentum, it appears to be on the immigrant-advocacy side. Colorado's General Assembly passed a bill earlier this month granting illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates to state colleges, and lawmakers there introduced another bill to repeal a 2006 law requiring police to cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nOther states have moved to grant driver's licenses to the young adult illegal immigrants who were given tentative legal status last year by President Obama. Several Republican attorneys general have stated that they consider immigration a national issue and want to see Washington take the lead on immigration reform.\n\nKris Kobach, the secretary of state in Kansas who was also a leading architect of Arizona's crackdown law, maintains that there is still an appetite to act. He believes that the states that were ready to take action in 2011 and 2012 have already done so, and other states are following their lead.\n\nKobach also expressed concern over President Obama's move to grant legal status to illegal immigrant young adults last year, stating that it created confusion about what other benefits they should be entitled to. He is leading a lawsuit by federal immigration agents challenging this policy.\n\nKobach stated that given President Obama's moves and the debate in Congress, state lawmakers who want to see a crackdown realize that the states are their only avenues for action. He also suggested that his home state of Kansas could repeal its in-state tuition rates for illegal immigrants.",
    " Title: Senate Reaches Agreement for Vote on Gun Control Measures Following 14-Hour Democratic Filibuster\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the United States Senate has reportedly agreed to hold votes on tighter gun control measures following a 14-hour filibuster led by Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy and several colleagues. The filibuster, which took place in the Senate on Thursday, was initiated in response to the Orlando nightclub massacre.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy (D-CT) announced the agreement in the early hours of Thursday, stating that Republican leaders had committed to holding votes on amendments to expand background checks and ban gun sales to individuals on the terror watchlist.\n\nMurphy, who began his speech at 11:21 AM and continued for over 14 hours, had vowed to remain on the Senate floor until there was a signal of cooperation on gun control. As the filibuster continued, updates and messages of support were posted on social media using the hashtags #enough and #holdthefloor.\n\nThe Connecticut senator evoked the Newtown school shooting in his state in 2012 in a plea that came as the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, said he would meet with the National Rifle Association (NRA) about the terror watchlist and gun purchases.\n\nThe election-year fight over gun control in the wake of the shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando pits strong proponents of the second amendment right to bear arms against those arguing for greater restrictions on the ability to obtain weapons. Trump, who has the endorsement of the NRA, told a rally in Georgia: \"I'm going to save your second amendment.\"\n\nThe Senate has not held a debate on gun control for several years, with the last significant changes to federal gun laws made in April 2007, when Congress passed a law to strengthen the instant background check system after a gunman at Virginia Tech who killed 32 people was able to purchase his weapons because his mental health history was not in the instant background check database.\n\nSenator Murphy is seeking a vote on legislation that would let the government bar sales of guns and explosives to people it suspects of being terrorists. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) offered a similar version of the amendment in December, a day after an extremist couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, but the Republican-run Senate rejected the proposal on a near party-line vote. Murphy also wants a vote to expand background checks.\n\nThe Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was added to a government watchlist of individuals known or suspected of being involved in terrorist activities in 2013, but was removed from the database 10 months later. The NRA has stated it is willing to meet with Donald Trump and reiterated its support for a bill from the Texas Republican senator John Cornyn that would allow the government to delay firearms sales to suspected terrorists for up to 72 hours. However, Democrats and gun control activists argue that this bar is too high.\n\nSeparately, Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, is reportedly working on a compromise with Pennsylvania senator Patrick Toomey, a Republican in a tough re-election race this year who has sought compromise in the past on gun control measures. By the end of the day, Toomey had introduced legislation that would direct the attorney general to create a new list of suspected terrorists who could be barred from buying weapons. However, Democrats immediately rejected that idea, stating it would create too much of a backlog.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Exempts Keystone XL Pipeline from Executive Order on Steel Use\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has decided to exempt the Keystone XL pipeline from an executive order signed in January that requires new pipelines, repairs, or retrofits to use U.S. steel \"to the maximum extent possible.\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that the pipeline, which has been in the works for a decade, is not covered by the executive order as it is already under construction.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, first proposed by developer TransCanada in 2008, was rejected by the Obama administration in 2015 on environmental grounds. However, an executive order by President Trump in January smoothed the way for construction on the pipeline to recommence. The southern section of the pipeline, which does not cross an international border and does not require State Department approval, is already operational.\n\nAllowing the pipeline to go forward is seen as a way for Trump to fulfill his pro-business campaign promises, while improving American infrastructure. The Institute for Energy Research reported that the Keystone XL pipeline added $5.7 billion to the economies of Oklahoma and Texas during the construction of the southern leg of the pipeline.\n\nTrump's infrastructure upgrades were some of the most compelling features of his campaign platform. A January Gallup poll found that support for revitalizing infrastructure ran far higher among the American public than any of Trump's other campaign issues, with 69 percent of respondents rating it \"very important.\"\n\nThe decision to exempt the Keystone XL pipeline from the steel executive order was initially threatened by Trump's populist program, encapsulated in the phrase, \"Buy American and hire American.\" However, the Trump administration appears to have rolled back Trump's initial statement that the executive order would apply to Keystone, citing that the steel for the pipeline is already in place.\n\nSupporters of the decision argue that it is a win for business and good economics, as using the cheapest inputs into any project will make the aggregate wealth richer. Critics may view the decision as a temporary demonstration of pragmatism rather than a shift in course. The Canadian government has also lauded the decision, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office calling it a \"recognition that the integrated Canadian and US steel industries are mutually beneficial.\"\n\nIn addition, allowing Keystone XL to go forward may persuade TransCanada to drop a $15 billion NAFTA complaint against the US, which it brought after construction was suspended earlier this week. American steel will be a feature of future pipelines, Sanders emphasized. \"Everything moving forward would fall under that executive order,\" she said.",
    " Title: Mass Layoffs in the U.S. Increase as Businesses Cite Regulatory Burdens and Economic Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn June, former President Obama stated that the private sector was doing fine. However, recent business headlines suggest a different reality, with mass layoffs becoming increasingly common. Last Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 1,316 \"mass layoff actions\" (affecting 50 workers or more) in September, resulting in the layoff of over 122,000 workers overall.\n\nSome of the recent layoff activity is connected to the slowest period of earnings growth since the third quarter of 2009. Businesses are undergoing necessary restructuring in response to the stagnant European economy, but many are attributing the layoffs to the regulatory policies and schemes of the current administration.\n\nOhio-based auto parts manufacturer Dana Holding Corp. warned employees of potential layoffs due to \"looming concern\" about the economy. President and CEO Roger Wood specifically mentioned the burden of \"increasing taxes on small businesses\" and the need to \"offset increased costs that are placed on us through new laws and regulations.\"\n\nOne example is Obamacare. The mandate will cost Dana Holding Corp., which employs some 24,500 workers, \"approximately $24 million over the next six years in additional U.S. health care expenses.\" In Ohio, the firm's Toledo area corporate offices laid off seven white-collar employees last Friday, with more layoffs expected.\n\nSimilarly, Consol Energy announced its intent to idle its Miller Creek surface operations near Naugatuck, W.Va. The move will affect the company's Wiley Surface Mine, Wiley Creek Surface Mine, Minway Surface Mine, Minway Preparation Plant, and Miller Creek Administration Group, all in Mingo County, W.Va. The impasse in the permit approval process, caused by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has led to the layoff of 145 Consol Energy employees at the end of the year.\n\nIn August, Robert E. Murray, founder and CEO of Murray Energy Corporation in Ohio, blasted the White House's anti-coal agenda for the layoffs and closure of his company's mine. He told CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien that \"the many regulations that (Obama) and his radical appointees and the U.S. EPA have put on the use of coal, there are dozens of them and collectively by his own energy administration, have closed 175 power plants.\"\n\nThe impending 2.3 percent medical device excise tax has already had a significant impact on the medical device industry. Companies such as Stryker, Covidien, Zoll Medical Corp., and Cook Medical Inc. have announced layoffs and plant closures due to the tax.\n\nThe heads of Koch Industries, Westgate Resorts, and ASG Software Solutions have also informed their employees of the negative effects of Obama's economic policies. Left-wing groups have criticized the executives for exercising their political free speech, but they have remained silent while the White House allegedly bribed federal defense contractors into delaying federally mandated layoff disclosures before the election.\n\nTruth suppression is a well-known tactic of the current administration. In 2010, the administration and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill attempted to punish Deere, Caterpillar, Verizon, and ATT for disclosing the costs of Obamacare taxes on their bottom lines, even though they were simply following SEC disclosure requirements. The White House also tried to silence insurers who dared to inform their customers about how Obamacare was driving up premiums. This time, however, the administration's bully boys do not have enough whitewash and duct tape to cover up the past, present, and future devastation of the president and his economic demolition team.",
    " Title: Common Core Faces Public Skepticism as Supporters Vow to Revamp Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Common Core, a set of academic standards aimed at elevating math, reading, and writing instruction across the nation, has faced a significant decline in public support, according to two recent national polls. The Education Next poll, released on Wednesday, also showed a steep drop in support among public school teachers.\n\nMichael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute and a proponent of the Common Core, commented, \"There's no denying that this is bad news for supporters of the Common Core.\"\n\nIn a positive development for Common Core backers, a district judge in Louisiana rejected Governor Bobby Jindal's attempt to repeal the standards by executive order. However, in Ohio, the Legislature is considering a bill to join the five other states that have repealed the standards in recent months.\n\nFacing mounting opposition, Common Core supporters have vowed to revamp their campaign. They will unveil the first step on Friday, with Latino evangelical pastors from across the country rallying their congregations behind the Common Core.\n\nThe guest speaker at this event will be former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who, six months ago, called Common Core \"a toxic term because it's come to mean things that most of us can't stomach, like top-down federal intrusion into the local schools where you live.\" Huckabee's blog post title at that time was \"Common Core is Dead.\"\n\nThe new polls indicate that over a year of high-profile opposition from parent activists, political figures, and celebrities has had a significant impact. The 46th annual PDK/Gallup poll, released on Wednesday, found that 80% of Americans have heard about the Common Core, and nearly half say they know at least \"a fair amount\" about the standards.\n\nHowever, this increased familiarity has led to distrust, with 60% of respondents opposing the use of the standards in their community. Among these opponents, over three-quarters cited local teachers' lack of support for the standards and concern about limiting teachers' flexibility in the classroom as primary reasons for their opposition.\n\nThe PDK/Gallup poll, sponsored by Phi Delta Kappa International, a trade association for educators, surveyed 1,001 adults.\n\nThe Education Next poll, released on Tuesday, found that the term \"Common Core\" has become a divisive issue. When respondents were asked about the Common Core, only 53% supported the standards, down from 65% a year ago. However, when the term \"Common Core\" was not mentioned, and respondents were asked about \"standards for reading and math that are the same across the states,\" support for the standards increased to 68%. This increase was consistent across political parties.\n\nThe Education Next poll also asked respondents who had heard of the Common Core a series of true/false questions about the standards. Large majorities got these questions wrong, incorrectly believing, for example, that the federal government mandates the use of the standards and that the Common Core strips away local control over textbooks.",
    " Title: Trump Accepts Putin's Denial of Election Interference, Draws Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday has sparked controversy, as Trump appeared to accept Putin's denial of any Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. This move has been criticized, as the U.S. intelligence community believes the Kremlin orchestrated a sophisticated campaign to help Trump win the presidency.\n\nAccording to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Trump told Putin that some in the United States were \"exaggerating\" the extent of Russia's influence on the election's outcome. This statement has been interpreted as Trump siding with Moscow in the ongoing domestic political debate.\n\nThe development is significant, as it seems Russia achieved its goal of having the Trump administration acknowledge that the Kremlin did not interfere in the election. The meeting took place amidst speculation about whether Congress would impose sanctions on Russia for its election meddling. Trump acknowledged the possibility of sanctions, but also expressed a desire to move past the issue.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson stated, \"The president took note of the actions that have been discussed by the Congress. But I think the two presidents \u2014 I think rightly \u2014 focused on how do we move forward?\"\n\nThe meeting's outcome has been anticipated by some analysts, as Russia was expected to emerge as a winner regardless of the meeting's content. The New York Times reported that Russia believed Putin would come out on top, either by the meeting producing no substantial results, or by Trump agreeing to work with Russia, which would portray the U.S. president as feckless due to Russia's defiance in Ukraine, Syria, and during the election.\n\nThe meeting also resulted in a ceasefire agreement in Syria's southwest, but the effectiveness of this agreement is unclear, as most of the fighting occurs in the east and north of the country, particularly in Raqqa. Critics argue that Trump may have done more damage by meeting with Putin than he would have by staying home.\n\nIn the aftermath of the meeting, Trump and Putin's focus on a Syria ceasefire has been overshadowed by Trump's tweet early on Friday morning, in which he questioned former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta about the Democratic National Committee's server. Podesta, who is currently on a cross-country trip, responded by calling Trump a \"whack job\" and urging him to \"get his head in the game.\"",
    " Title: Whistleblower Lawyers Express Safety Concerns Amidst Calls for Identity Disclosure\n\nArticle:\n\nLawyers for the intelligence official who filed a whistleblower complaint against President Trump have expressed \"serious concerns\" for their client's safety, according to reports. A letter signed by the whistleblower's lead attorney, Andrew Bakaj, and sent to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire pointed to Trump's call for \"the person who gave the whistleblower the information\" to be publicly identified, as reported by NBC News.\n\nThe letter, dated Saturday and made public Sunday, stated that events from the past week \"have heightened our concerns that our client's identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm's way.\"\n\nBakaj acknowledged that it was the unidentified whistleblower's source of information whom Trump's comment targeted, but he wrote that the distinction \"does nothing to assuage our concerns for our client's safety.\" The lawyer also claimed that \"certain individuals\" had offered a $50,000 bounty for information about their client's identity.\n\nThe Washington Examiner, a conservative news outlet, reported last week that two right-wing activists had offered the sum for \"credible information corroborating\" the person's identity.\n\nOn Sunday, the president suggested in a tweet that he wants the whistleblower to be outed. \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called 'Whistleblower,' represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe lawyers also called on lawmakers to speak out for whistleblower protections and insist that retaliation against the official\u2014 \"whether direct or implied\"\u2014 would not be tolerated, according to Business Insider.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we expect this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter,\" the letter said.\n\nCBS News has reported that the whistleblower\u2014 identified by the New York Times as a CIA officer\u2014 was already under federal protection. However, Mark Zaid, a lawyer from Compass Rose Legal, tweeted that CBS \"completely misinterpreted contents of our letter,\" saying the legal team had not yet reached an agreement with Congress regarding contact with their client.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.)\u2014 chairman of the House Intelligence Committee\u2014 told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that he expected the whistleblower to testify \"very soon\" once security measures were implemented to protect the person's identity.\n\nLast week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would launch a formal impeachment inquiry in light of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough summary of the conversation revealed Trump's apparent efforts to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nOn Thursday, the complaint by the whistleblower, who believed Trump was \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\" in the 2020 election, was released to the public. The intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, deemed the Aug. 12 complaint \"credible\" and of \"urgent concern\" and passed it on to Maguire, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee. Maguire said that both the whistleblower and the inspector general \"acted in good faith throughout\" and \"have done everything by the book and followed the law.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Party's Identity Crisis: Kamala Harris's Exit Highlights Party's Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is grappling with an identity crisis, as evidenced by the recent withdrawal of Senator Kamala Harris from the 2020 presidential race. For years, Harris was known as the \"female Obama,\" but her campaign struggled to gain traction in the primary field, with critics labeling her as a candidate trying to be all things to all people.\n\nAs the Democratic primary voters coalesced around candidates with sharper ideological profiles, Harris found herself struggling to convince loyalists in either camp that she would be a reliable voice for their issues. The primary has crystallized into a contest between the party's two wings, with Harris falling by the wayside, fully trusted by neither faction.\n\nThe first group, personified most intensely by former Vice President Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, are the Adjusters. They believe that the world was a pretty good place in October 2016, and that removing President Donald Trump from office represents a necessary course correction that will allow the country to proceed upon the path that Barack Obama had outlined during his presidency. \"We made a mistake,\" they say. \"Let's just fix it and get back to normal.\"\n\nThe other movement is led by the Revolutionaries, with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the forefront. They see removing Trump from office as only the first step, which must be followed by sweeping, even radical change. Revolutionaries see Obama as an incrementalist and dismiss the Clintons as sellouts. They call for a much more dramatic overhaul, but one that unnerves risk-averse establishment Democrats who worry that such an ambitious agenda could drive centrist voters to Trump.\n\nIn addition to Biden and Buttigieg, the ranks of the Adjusters have recently been swelled by the addition of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to the race. Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are part of this faction as well, as are the lower-tier candidates Michael Bennet, the Colorado senator, and John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman. All face a similar challenge of trying to excite primary voters with some variation of a more cautious agenda.\n\nThe rest of the primary candidates are Revolutionaries. Along with Warren and Sanders, nontraditional alternatives such as entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, and impeachment activist Tom Steyer occupy this space as well, along with fading options like former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and author Marianne Williamson. They might differ on the specifics of their policy prescriptions, but all advocate for a much more fundamental shift in the priorities of their party and the country.\n\nHarris was the only Democratic candidate who made a serious effort to talk to voters in both groups. Lacking the skills of Obama and the experience of Bill Clinton, she was unable to convince either Adjusters or the Revolutionaries that she was one of them. Rejected by both, she now returns to the Senate, where the upcoming impeachment trial gives her the opportunity to burnish her credentials for a spot on the ticket or a Cabinet post.\n\nThe divide in the Democratic Party remains, even with Harris's exit. Just as in 2016, when many Sanders supporters stayed home instead of voting, or chose Trump or third-party candidates, a similar temptation will exist in 2020 if a moderate becomes the Democratic nominee. Conversely, the late Bloomberg and Patrick entries reflect growing worries in the party's centrist establishment wing about Democratic prospects in the general election.\n\nThe eventual nominee will not defeat Trump unless the Adjusters and Revolutionaries are able to put aside their differences. Harris's greatest contribution to her party this year may be to serve as a reminder of what could happen if that unity is not achieved.",
    " Title: Obama Seeks Conclusive Proof of Chemical Weapons Use in Syria Before Taking Action\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is reportedly considering a potential shift in U.S. policy towards Syria, following intelligence assessments suggesting that chemical munitions, known to be in the possession of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's military, were used on a small scale in Syria.\n\nDuring a press conference in Washington on Tuesday, Mr. Obama emphasized the need for more conclusive evidence before taking any action. \"What we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria, but we don't know how they were used, when they were used, who used them; we don't have chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe President also expressed concern about rushing to judgment without solid evidence, stating, \"If we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we can find ourselves in the position where we can't mobilize the international community to support what we do.\"\n\nDespite the lack of conclusive proof, officials have reported that the Pentagon has prepared a range of options for Mr. Obama, including airstrikes, commando raids, and the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Syria. The administration is also reportedly looking for ways to increase aid to the rebels.\n\nPreviously, President Obama had resisted calls to arm the rebels, including from David H. Petraeus, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. A proposal by Mr. Petraeus to provide arms to carefully vetted members of the opposition was shelved last fall, though several officials expect it to be revisited.",
    " Title: Iranian Hackers Advance Capabilities in Cyberattacks, Pose Increased Threat to Critical Infrastructure\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the past year, Iranian hackers have targeted the presidential campaign of former U.S. President Donald Trump, telecom companies, infrastructure systems, and more than 200 oil, gas, and heavy machinery companies worldwide. According to James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, these hackers have developed the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure and have the capability to wipe data. The question now is which services, such as pipelines or dams, they may target next.\n\nIran is not yet considered at the top of the list of countries with the ability to cause widespread destruction via cyberattacks, Mr. Lewis and other experts said. However, Tehran has made significant strides since 2009, when a classified intelligence assessment concluded that it had the motivation but lacked the skills and resources to inflict harm.\n\nSince 2010, when an Iranian nuclear facility was the target of a joint American-Israeli cyberattack, Iran has embraced such attacks as part of its strategy of \"asymmetrical warfare.\" While the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps may never match the West in conventional warfare, its specialized teams have learned how much destruction they can cause to vulnerable systems, according to American intelligence assessments and private security researchers.\n\nOver the past five years, American officials and cybersecurity experts have tracked Iranian hackers as they have significantly advanced their capabilities beyond wiping data to sophisticated attacks on financial networks, internet infrastructure, energy companies, and critical infrastructure sites like the Bowman Dam in Westchester County and the Energy Department's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls.\n\n\"They now have the ability to do serious harm,\" Mr. Lewis said. \"As the conflict with the U.S. continues, they're going to be tempted. Expect to see a lot more testing of how far they can get into company networks, universities, federal networks, and smaller government networks in towns and cities.\"\n\nOn Friday, Iranian leaders issued strident calls for revenge against the United States after the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani in an overnight airstrike at the Baghdad airport. The potential for increased cyberattacks from Iran in response to this event cannot be ruled out.",
    " Title: New Book Alleges Hunter Biden's Business Deals with Foreign Governments and Oligarchs\n\nArticle:\n\nAuthor Peter Schweizer's new book, \"Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite,\" claims that Hunter Biden, son of 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, forged business deals with individuals and entities tied to the governments of Russia, China, and Kazakhstan, reportedly earning him hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe book details how Hunter Biden and his business partner, Devon Archer, were deeply involved with an entity called the Burnham Financial Group. According to a copy of the book viewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588, Hunter and Archer, through Burnham, made foreign deals with governments and oligarchs.\n\nOne of those oligarchs was Nurlan Abduov, an associate of another Kazakh oligarch, Kenges Rakishev. Rakishev is the son-in-law of the former vice prime minister of Kazakhstan, Imangali Tasmagambetov. Tasmagamvetov was also formerly the defense minister, and is now the Kazakh ambassador to Russia.\n\nThe book alleges that an account Hunter regularly received funds from showed money arriving from a firm run by Rakishev in 2014. Additionally, Archer reportedly acted as a backchannel between Kazakhstan and then-Secretary of State John Kerry, according to the book.\n\nFurthermore, Burnham had business deals with two mysterious Chinese companies \u2014 Kirin Global Enterprises Limited and Harvest Global Investors, according to Schweizer. Kirin Global Enterprise Limited was an investment vehicle run by Xiangyao (or Yaojun) \"Larry\" Liu and Guo Jianfeng, according to Schweizer. Harvest Global Investors was a Chinese investment firm linked to the government in Beijing.\n\nBurnham also had a financial relationship with Russian Oligarch Yelena Baturina, a billionaire with extensive political connections in Moscow and links to Russian organized crime, according to Schweizer. Archer reportedly said Baturina invested $200 million into \"various investment funds\" with which he was involved.\n\nThe book also alleges that Burnham was involved in a $60 million fraudulent bond scheme to rip off union pension funds and the poorest Indian tribe in America, the Oglala Sioux. In May 2016, Archer was arrested in New York and charged with \"orchestrating a scheme to defraud investors and a Native American tribal entity of tens of millions of dollars.\"\n\nAlthough Hunter Biden was not charged, Schweizer writes, \"his fingerprints were all over Burnham.\" The legitimacy that his name and political status as the vice president's son lent to Burnham was brought up repeatedly during the trial, he writes. That status was used as a means of both recruiting pension money into the scheme and alleviating investors' concerns, he writes.\n\nHunter Biden had an office at Burnham's New York City offices on Fifty-Seventh Street, and during the trial, numerous witnesses came forward describing Hunter's involvement with the firm, according to the book.\n\nSchweizer writes that these deals have long been a pattern with the Biden family, including Hunter Biden: \"With the election of his father as vice president, Hunter Biden launched businesses fused to his father's power that led him to lucrative deals with a rogue's gallery of governments and oligarchs around the world.\"",
    " Title: Benghazi Committee Investigation: Focus on Pre-Attack Activities and Security Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi, established to investigate the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the death of four Americans, is set to hold a hearing on Thursday. The focus of the hearing is not expected to be on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails, but rather on the underlying question of the purpose of the Americans' presence in Benghazi and the security arrangements in place.\n\nThe committee is expected to question the nature of the mission of the former special forces personnel in Benghazi, who were not typically involved in visa issuance or lost luggage tasks associated with consulates and embassy annexes. The committee will likely seek to clarify who Ambassador Christopher Stevens was supposed to meet in Benghazi and who was responsible for his security.\n\nAnother point of interest is the Libyan militia groups that the U.S. was partnering with and the process of vetting these groups. There have been unconfirmed reports suggesting that the Benghazi mission may have been a gun-running operation to transfer Qaddafi's abandoned weapons to Syrian rebels. The committee may question whether American contractors were involved in such activities.\n\nThe committee is also expected to delve into the weeks leading up to the attack, focusing on the repeated calls for increased security by Ambassador Stevens that were reportedly ignored. The absence of a rescue mission during the attack is another area of concern.\n\nThe committee will also question who made the decision to attribute the events of September 11, 2012, to a planned terrorist attack rather than a YouTube video sparking a demonstration that escalated.\n\nThe committee's investigation will also seek to determine whether the Libyan war was another example of the Obama administration's alleged affinity for moderately radical Islamists. The committee will examine whether the administration was willfully blind to the dangers posed by radical Islamists in Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Iran.\n\nThe committee's inquiry comes amidst new evidence, including Ambassador Stevens' own emails, which may make it difficult for witnesses to evade questions. The hearing will mark the latest development in a long-running investigation that has yet to yield definitive answers.",
    " Title: Norwegian Police Investigate Mosque Shooting as Act of Terrorism\n\nArticle:\n\nA 21-year-old Norwegian man, allegedly expressing far-right views, opened fire at a mosque near Oslo, Norway's capital, on Saturday. The suspect, identified by reports as Philip Manshaus, was heavily armed and shot through a glass door to enter the Al-Noor Islamic Center.\n\nThe gunman was overpowered by a 65-year-old worshipper, who was injured in the confrontation. The shooting could have resulted in more casualties if the suspect had arrived a few minutes earlier, as there were more than a dozen people inside the mosque just 10 minutes before the incident. However, by the time the suspect arrived, only three older men remained, and one of them managed to disarm the shooter.\n\nFollowing the mosque shooting, police found the body of the gunman's 17-year-old stepsister at his home in Baerum, west of Oslo. The gunman has been charged with the murder of the woman and is facing an attempted murder charge for the mosque shooting.\n\nPolice in Oslo are investigating the shooting as terrorism due to the gunman's apparent intent to instill fear. However, they emphasized that there is no evidence he was part of a larger network. Authorities stated that the suspect had expressed far-right views, including admiration for Vidkun Quisling, Norway's leader who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II.\n\nHours before the attack, a user with the same name as the alleged gunman posted on the 4chan messaging board, expressing admiration for the gunman who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques earlier this year. The post included a meme that described that gunman as a \"saint\" and praised the alleged El Paso, Texas, shooter for \"reclaiming his country.\" The post was made on a new messaging board called Endchan and the older site 4chan.\n\nAuthorities ordered police to guard mosques in the city. As Muslims celebrated the beginning of Eid al-Adha on Sunday, many non-Muslims stood outside mosques in Oslo to stand guard. \"This is not supposed to happen in Norway,\" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said. \"Norway should be safe. All places of worship shall be safe.\"\n\nThis article has been updated with new information since its original publication.",
    " Title: FBI Background Checks for Firearm Purchases Decline After December High\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing a record-breaking high in December, the number of background checks run through the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has decreased year-over-year for the first time since October 2011. The decline in checks, which serve as a proxy for gun sales, suggests a waning interest in firearm purchases following the aftermath of the Connecticut school shooting and subsequent government push for new gun control measures.\n\nIn June, 1.3 million checks were performed through the FBI's NICS, a significant drop from the 2.7 million in December and a decrease of approximately 20,000 compared to the same month last year. This marks the first year-to-year drop in checks since October 2011.\n\nDavid Chipman, a former agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who now advises the gun control advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, attributes the decline to a saturation of gun purchases. \"It seems that those motivated by fear to purchase a firearm over the past several months have acquired all of the guns they desire or can afford,\" he said.\n\nNICS checks surged by nearly 500,000 in November compared to the previous year, surpassing the 2 million mark for the first time. In December, they increased by over 900,000, reaching an all-time high of 2.7 million. John Hudak, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies gun issues, attributes the spike to a sense of threat and the subsequent need for self-protection.\n\n\"People felt a threat. The need created by that threat was then satisfied. The shock and horror has died down in pretty dramatic fashion over the past few months,\" Mr. Hudak said.\n\nIn addition to the fear of personal threat, Mr. Hudak suggests that another factor driving the surge in gun purchases was the fear of government intervention in gun sales. This theory is supported by the defeat of a gun control bill in the Senate in mid-April, despite months of administration lobbying and President Obama's extensive use of the public \"bully pulpit.\"\n\nNICS checks are not a one-to-one correlation to gun sales, as some checks are performed on active concealed carry permits and other nonsale actions. However, the number of checks serves as a fairly decent, though imperfect, proxy for the number of guns sold.\n\nThe National Sports Shooting Foundation, the trade group for the guns and ammunition industry, keeps its own adjusted tally every month to account for such checks that don't translate directly into sales. According to Mike Bazinet, a spokesman for the group, low numbers in the middle of the year aren't out of the ordinary. By the group's metric, the adjusted June figure of 872,025 is actually an increase of 3 percent over June 2012 and the 37th straight month of year-over-year monthly increases.\n\nJosh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, cautions against reading too much into any comparisons with figures from December, as that month is always the biggest. Year-over-year, he points out, the number of checks increased from January through May and were basically flat in June, adjusting for permit checks.\n\n\"Months always vary in a pattern. They vary in the same way,\" he said.\n\nThe decline in NICS checks might signal to some that the issue is fading from the public eye, but President Obama and groups like Mr. Horwitz's have vowed not to let that happen. Immediately after the Newtown shooting, Mr. Obama rolled out an ambitious gun control package that included bans on semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines and near-universal background checks. That package ultimately devolved into a compromise measure that would expand background checks to sales online and at gun shows. Even that measure failed to pass the Senate.\n\nMr. Obama and others have reassured advocates that they will revisit the issue. \"The American people are there,\" Vice President Joseph R. Biden said last month. \"In the meantime, the president is going to continue to take every executive action within his power to make schools safer for our children, churches safe places to worship, and significantly work on reducing the number of gun deaths in America. No matter how long it takes, we're determined to do something about it.\"",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Chief of Staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, and Communications Director, Corbin Trent, are leaving their positions in her Congressional office following a series of controversies. Chakrabarti will depart on Friday, while Trent will remain as Congressional spokesman until the end of the month and then transition to Ocasio-Cortez's 2020 campaign.\n\nChakrabarti will join New Consensus, a nonprofit climate change group that promotes the Green New Deal. Trent will take on the same role in Ocasio-Cortez's 2020 campaign.\n\nThe Intercept first reported the departures, which were later confirmed by The Washington Post. Chakrabarti and Trent's aggressive tactics have reportedly made life challenging for Ocasio-Cortez in Washington.\n\nOne of the most significant controversies involved Chakrabarti's tweet likening moderate Democrats to \"new southern Democrats,\" which was widely criticized as racially charged. He also targeted moderate Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from a formerly red Kansas district, in a tweet that was seen as attacking a Native American woman of color.\n\nIn June, Trent generated negative press when he used profanity in a tweet directed at a potential Republican challenger.\n\nBoth aides joined Ocasio-Cortez's team after working on her successful primary campaign, where they served as leaders of the Justice Democrats, an insurgent group that aimed to replace Democratic incumbents with progressive candidates.\n\nThe finances surrounding the Justice Democrats have also attracted criticism, with three Federal Election Commission complaints filed by conservative groups due to an unusual setup in which money from the PAC flowed into two limited liability companies controlled by Chakrabarti.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Trent have presented a positive image of the departures. In a statement, Trent said, \"We are extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda and improve the lives of the people in NY-14.

    " Title: Honduras Signs \"Safe Third Country\" Agreement with U.S. to Process Asylum Seekers\n\nArticle:\n\nHonduras has signed a deal with the U.S. government that could potentially return migrants seeking asylum in the United States to Honduras, in an effort to curb migration. This agreement, announced on Wednesday, follows similar agreements signed by El Salvador on September 20 and Guatemala on July 26.\n\nThe details of the implementation of these agreements have not been disclosed by the countries involved. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official, who spoke to reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity, stated that the Honduras deal aims to allow migrants to seek protection as close to their home as possible.\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented a rule on July 16 that bars most migrants from gaining U.S. asylum if they did not seek safe haven in a country they transited through first. This rule, which serves a similar purpose to the agreements, has faced legal challenges. Initially, a federal court blocked the rule from taking effect, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.\n\nThe majority of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are from the three northern triangle countries, and many turn themselves in to border officials to ask for asylum in the United States. President Donald Trump has made reducing the growing number of asylum claims a top priority of his administration, and has implemented various measures to discourage migrants from applying.\n\nHowever, immigrant advocates argue that sending people seeking refuge back to the region where they fled, even if not to their home country, violates international commitments meant to prevent vulnerable migrants from being returned to danger. The three countries have small asylum offices that may struggle to process a large number of claims, they say.\n\nHonduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez has faced scrutiny over a court filing document related to the upcoming drug trafficking trial in New York of his brother, Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hernandez. President Hernandez has denied any wrongdoing. In a speech on Wednesday before the UN General Assembly, Hernandez defended his political reputation against what he called \"smears\" from \"criminals\" and others, without outright referring to the allegations against him.",

The AP phone story broke at 7:50. Why is Eric Holder still attorney general?\"\n\nThe political stakes for the White House are high, with NBC's First Read observing, \"The rule of three... means the president's credibility is truly on the line right now.\"\n\nThe controversy over the seizure of the AP's phone records is unique in its bipartisan nature. On Monday, the AP, a major news cooperative, announced that the Justice Department had secretly obtained two months of phone records for reporters and editors in New York, Washington, and Hartford, Connecticut. The government seized records for more than 20 separate phone lines used by more than 100 reporters in April and May 2012.\n\nAP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt wrote to Holder, calling the operation a \"massive and unprecedented intrusion\" into how news organizations do their work. \"There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of telephone communications,\" Mr. Pruitt said.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Holder said he recused himself from the decision to subpoena the AP's phone records, and that the decision had been made by Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole, who is handling the case. Holder said he stepped aside because he had been interviewed in the investigation into who provided information for a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot that targeted the US. The attorney general said the leak his department was investigating \"put the American people at risk.\"\n\nThe Justice Department released a statement defending its actions, saying, \"We take seriously our obligations to follow all applicable laws, federal regulations, and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations... Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws.\"\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued a statement, saying, \"I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government's explanation.\"\n\nOn Monday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a statement distancing the White House from the investigation. \"We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, however, he offered Holder some support: \"The president has confidence in the attorney general.\"\n\nWhen Holder was asked about his future last month on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, he responded, \"I don't know,\" when asked if he would stay the full four years of Obama's second term. He added, \"I'm happy. I'm still enjoying what I'm doing and still want to be done. I'm still the president's wing man, and I'm here with my boy.\"",
    " Title: Cruz Announces Carly Fiorina as Vice Presidential Running Mate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to shake up the 2016 Republican presidential race as Donald Trump moves closer to the nomination, Senator Ted Cruz announced former GOP primary rival Carly Fiorina as his choice for vice president should he win the party's nomination. The announcement was immediately dismissed as a sign of desperation by the Trump team, but Cruz defended the decision, claiming that no candidate is likely to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and voters should \"know what they will get.\"\n\nSpeaking in Indianapolis, Cruz, alongside Fiorina, aimed to counter Trump's narrative that the race is effectively over after the front-runner swept five primary states on Tuesday. Fiorina, in accepting Cruz's offer, expressed readiness to \"fight.\"\n\nThe theoretical pairing represents a diverse ticket, offering the possibility of electing the first Hispanic president and the first female vice president. Cruz emphasized that the choice signified trust in Fiorina's leadership abilities, stating, \"This is a choice that you are telling the American people that 'This is an individual that I trust and, more important, this is an individual that you can trust to lead this country, no matter what might happen.'\"\n\nHowever, for the time being, Fiorina will hold the position of vice presidential candidate-in-waiting, as Cruz continues to lag far behind Trump in the battle for the GOP nomination. Even Fiorina would have to be elected by delegates at the convention. As for Cruz, he has been mathematically eliminated from clinching the nomination before the convention and is relying on the prospect of a contested convention.\n\nCruz's selection of a vice presidential candidate in April, while he is well behind in delegates, follows a pattern of somewhat unconventional campaigning, including an early embrace of Trump and kicking off his campaign without first forming an exploratory committee. Fiorina began her career as a secretary and receptionist but quickly rose up the business ranks and was named in 1999 as the chief executive officer for Hewlett-Packard, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company.\n\nTrump, who leads Cruz in pledged delegates (954-562), dismissed the notion of Cruz tapping a running mate, stating, \"He should not be naming anybody because he does not even have a chance.\" In a statement later Wednesday, Trump criticized the move as Cruz \"only trying to stay relevant.\"\n\nWhile most presidential candidates wait until they have the nomination sewn up to announce a running mate, Cruz's selection of a vice presidential candidate in April, while he is well behind in delegates, follows a pattern of somewhat unconventional campaigning. Fiorina's career as a political candidate began when she tried to unseat California Sen. Barbara Boxer during an unsuccessful 2010 bid. Boxer on Wednesday mocked the suggestion of Fiorina as Cruz's running mate, stating, \"The best way to describe that ticket is mean and meaner.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Fiorina announced her candidacy for president and quickly became known as a feisty critic of Hillary Clinton and a strong defender of the pro-life community. Planned Parenthood immediately panned Fiorina's Wednesday pairing with Cruz as \"the most loathsome pair of anti-abortion extremists in America.\" Her early debate performances were lauded by many critics, but she never gained traction and suspended her campaign after single-digit finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. She endorsed Cruz in early March and has appeared often with him on the campaign trail.\n\nWhen asked about being Cruz's vice president in early March, Fiorina replied, \"Let's win the nomination first.\" Though she eventually threw her support behind Cruz, Fiorina also attacked him when she was still a competing candidate, terming him one of the \"ultimate insiders\" and calling him \"too divisive\" in January. She also criticized Cruz for saying \"one thing in the drawing rooms of Manhattan and another thing in the living rooms of Iowa.\"",
    " Title: Education Secretary Arne Duncan Calls for Action on Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at Washington D.C.'s Neval Thomas Elementary School on Friday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan called for a collaborative effort among school leaders, politicians, Second Amendment advocates, and others to address gun violence in America. He urged for swift and significant progress in reducing gun violence, emphasizing the need for personal involvement.\n\nDuncan, a member of President Obama's task force on gun violence and mental health, addressed the complex factors that led to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, last week. He suggested that limiting access to high-powered firearms is the simplest and easiest solution to this issue, a point he reiterated by questioning what might have transpired if the shooter, Adam Lanza, did not have access to such weapons.\n\nDuncan, who has witnessed the impact of gun violence during his tenure as chief of Chicago public schools, expressed his concern that Lanza's actions may have had a different outcome if he did not have access to guns. He lamented the loss of 26 lives and the families in Newtown who are now attending funerals instead of celebrating the holidays.\n\nOn the same day, the National Rifle Association is scheduled to hold its first press conference since the Newtown massacre. This anticipated address is expected to provide insights into the potential challenges gun-control proponents may face in enacting stricter laws. Currently, gun-control advocates are advocating for the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban, the closing of the so-called \"gun show loophole,\" and limits to high-capacity ammunition clips, similar to those used by Lanza at Sandy Hook.\n\nSecretary Duncan concluded his address by stating that reasonable people should be able to agree on these restrictions.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing: A Study in Contrasts and Political Dilemmas\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday was a complex and contrasting event, marked by respectful treatment of Christine Blasey Ford, the accuser, and a display of anger and indignation from Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the accused.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, the accuser, came across as deferential, nervous, and deeply concerned with accuracy. Her testimony was specific and emotional, detailing the impact the alleged assault had on her life, including installing a second front door on her house due to the aftereffects of the attack. Judge Kavanaugh, on the other hand, was perceived as an angry and bullying figure, prone to yelling, weeping, and making political accusations.\n\nThe Republican senators, all men, were careful to avoid the appearance of grilling Ford, as they had done with Anita Hill in 1991. Instead, a prosecutor from Arizona, Rachel Mitchell, asked many of their questions. They performed a kind of stilted politeness and frequently called Ford \"credible.\" However, they showed little interest in listening to her grave testimony, portraying the hearing's findings as a simple he-said/she-said standoff, and ultimately voting to advance Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\nThe hollowness of the proceedings put a fine point on our new political reality. The hearing revealed a world in which norms have changed, and even the Republican party has realized it can't score points by personally attacking those who say they are victims of sexual assault. However, the party is still able to indulge in an old kind of hypocrisy, pretending to believe Ford's words without taking them seriously enough to delay the nomination process.\n\nA day later, on Friday, two sexual assault survivors emotionally confronted Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator, urging him to consider the impact of his vote. The confrontation was raw and painful, and it revealed the real power of women's voices. Shortly after, Flake called for an FBI investigation that is now taking place.\n\nThe Kavanaugh affair is a referendum on the political power of women, and as dark as the hearing was, Friday's turn of events offered a bracing reminder: The right knows it has a woman problem. It may not want to listen to the voices on its threshold, but they are only getting louder.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Alters U Visa Policy, Allowing Deportation of Pending Applicants\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has revised its handling of U visas, a class of visa granted to immigrants who cooperate with criminal investigations. The change allows the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to deport pending U visa applicants at their discretion, making immigrants less likely to report serious crimes, according to immigration attorneys.\n\nThe revised ICE directive, announced on Aug. 2, allows ICE to grant permission for people to stay in the country as they await their U visas. However, it also permits ICE to deport pending U visa applicants. Applications for U visas can take up to four years, and the government issues 10,000 per year, with no limit on visas for spouses and children of applicants or parents of applicants who are under 21.\n\nThe directive states that ICE will review the totality of the circumstances, including any favorable or adverse factors, and any federal interests implicated, to decide whether a stay of removal or terminating proceedings is appropriate. ICE also reserves the right to \"exercise its discretion\" in determining whether to grant stay of removal requests, but warns that the agency \"no longer exempts classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\"\n\nIn a statement to a news outlet, an ICE spokesperson defended the change as necessary due to the volume of applications. \"As the number of U visa petitions submitted increased, this process became burdensome on both agencies and such determinations didn\u2019t reflect a qualitative assessment of any assistance provided to law enforcement,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nImmigration attorneys argue that the new directive will have a chilling effect on immigrants who might otherwise report crimes. Eileen Blessinger, a Falls Church, Va.-based immigration attorney, told the news outlet, \"By applying, you\u2019re essentially reporting yourself to ICE, but now there\u2019s a risk that ICE might pick you up.\"\n\nBlessinger also noted that the change piggybacks on another policy change that began about a year ago, when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended its practice of waiving fees for U visa applicants. This change reduced the number of people who could seek out U visas.\n\nBlessinger shared a case where a client, a father of a child sexual abuse victim, was deported twice before but was able to file for a U visa, which was eventually approved, and will be able to stay in the United States and continue to cooperate with the sexual abuse investigation. If he had applied for the U visa under the terms of the new ICE directive, however, he could have been deported.\n\nAnother client of Blessinger's is a Salvadoran immigrant and victim of domestic violence who came to the U.S. in 2004 and has been detained in Caroline Detention Facility in Fort A.P. Hill, Va. after failing to appear in court in El Paso, Texas, after receiving a notice to appear that did not include her hearing's date or time.\n\nCecelia Friedman Levin, senior policy counsel at ASISTA Immigration Assistance, told the news outlet that the new ICE policies impacting the U visa program contravene the purpose that Congress created the protections for. \"What we see here with new ICE policies that impact the U visa program is that some of these changes really contravene the purpose that Congress created these protections for,\" she said.\n\nKristian Ramos, communications director at the immigrant advocacy group Define American, told the news outlet that the change was indicative of the administration's general handling of long-standing immigration policy. \"This administration's reckless changing of long-standing laws has very human casualties,\" Ramos said. \"The client came forward under the auspices that the law would protect her from deportation, and it's incredibly unfair to literally just change the rules on someone who is just trying to get help.\"\n\nThe full guidance for the new U visa policy has yet to be publicly issued by ICE, complicating the process further.",
    " Title: California Teacher Tenure Rules Declared Unconstitutional by Los Angeles County Superior Court\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark ruling, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolfe Treu declared California's teacher tenure rules unconstitutional on Tuesday in the case of Vergara v California. The ruling, which is subject to an inevitable appeal, could spur litigation in additional states.\n\nTeachers in K-12 schools do not enjoy tenure in the same way as university professors. However, in many states, including California, teachers are afforded a broad array of employment protections often characterized as due process. These protections make it difficult for school officials to dismiss teachers based on performance or for being relatively ineffective.\n\nJudge Treu, citing the landmark Brown v Board of Education case, held that students have a constitutional right to equal education. He further argued that California's system of teacher job security violates this right by having long-term negative consequences for students and disproportionately affecting heavily minority schools.\n\nTeachers unions and their liberal allies argue that Treu's ruling is incorrect, viewing the anti-tenure movement as a thinly veiled union-busting effort. On the other hand, education reformers, who typically advocate for performance-based compensation and job security, largely support the ruling.\n\nThe case for strong teacher job security operates on two levels. The more general level is the belief that the American labor market should feature strong labor unions and employment protections. The specific case revolves around the difficulty of moving from the general idea of merit-based employment decisions to the need to find specific operational rules.\n\nReformers tend to favor using a value-added model that tracks student test scores and measures teachers based on how much their students' scores rise. Critics argue that these value-added models are unstable and unreliable, and that test-based incentive programs may lead to cheating and \"teaching to the test.\"\n\nProponents note that value-added measures correlate with adult life outcomes. The students of teachers highly rated by VA methods are more likely to attend college, attend highly ranked colleges, earn higher salaries, live in higher socioeconomic status neighborhoods, and even save more for retirement.\n\nThe ruling has no immediate consequences, as Judge Treu issued a \"tentative decision\" in anticipation of appeal. The case will be appealed to the California Supreme Court. If that court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, there will be significant changes in California education. If not, things will continue on their present course.\n\nHowever, California is only one of 50 states. The success of this lawsuit may encourage reform groups to file similar litigation in other states. Expect more education-related litigation soon.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Presidential Campaign: A Look into the Republican Nominee's Journey\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president, is experiencing a surge in his campaign following his victories in the primaries of Kentucky and Arkansas, and his upcoming win in Texas. The polls are showing an upward trend for Romney, and he recently completed a two-day tour through Connecticut and New York, where he met with major donors and secured significant funds.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Romney discussed his campaign, attributing its success to a growing sense among voters that the country is on the wrong path and a belief that he has proven himself capable. \"We went through those 37 or 38 contests and won the must-win states, and in some cases we started off 10 points behind. And we hustled, worked hard, and convinced the voters,\" Romney said.\n\nRomney reflected on the difference between the America he saw in 2008 and the one he sees now. \"A much higher degree of anxiety today. People much less confident in the security of their job, less confident in the prospects for their children,\" he stated. In 2008, the economic downturn had not yet occurred, and the central issue in his primary was Iraq. Now, the economy is the primary focus.\n\nBefore rallies and town meetings, Romney holds private, off-the-record meetings with voters. \"I sit down with five or six couples or individuals and just go around the table, and I ask them to tell me about their life. And the stories I hear suggest a degree of anxiety which is not reflected in the statistics,\" Romney shared. He is struck by the number of people who are employed but in legitimate fear of being let go, and by the number of people who have seen their retirement investments decline.\n\nRomney keeps a campaign journal on his iPad, writing entries every two or three days to remember the campaign and capture \"the feelings\u2014the ups, the downs, the people I meet and the sense I have about what's going to happen.\" He finds joy in the political rallies and town meetings, where he engages with individuals, but views the game of politics as a competition for \"old guys.\"\n\nWhen asked about his mood, Romney replied, \"Depends on the day.\" He stated that he is unhappy only when he has done something that hurts the prospects for the success of his campaign. He emphasized that his self-worth is not dependent on winning an election.\n\nRegarding historical parallels, Romney stated, \"It's 2012.\" He believes that while history may repeat its lessons, it does not repeat itself identically. He believes the United States is currently experiencing an inflection point, similar to the Civil War and the turn of the last century, where culture, industry, and military strategy have changed. Romney believes America is deciding whether it will follow a path toward Europe, becoming a government-dominated nation with high unemployment and low wage growth, or a path of economic vitality. If Barack Obama is re-elected, Romney believes it will be difficult to change course, but if he is elected, he will usher in a period of economic growth that will surprise the world and America.",
    " Title: Inspector General Report Finds Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Lacked Candor, Violated FBI Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice Inspector General has released a report stating that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe improperly leaked information to a reporter and lied to his boss, then-Director James Comey, and to FBI agents investigating his behavior. The report could potentially damage McCabe's credibility and impact ongoing investigations.\n\nThe report, which has been circulating within the government for weeks, was used to justify McCabe's firing earlier this year, just days before he was set to retire and collect his pension. The Inspector General's report concluded that McCabe lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions in connection with describing his role in a disclosure to the Wall Street Journal, and that this conduct violated FBI Offense Codes 2.5 and 2.6.\n\nThe report also found that McCabe's disclosure of the existence of an ongoing investigation, in the manner described in the report, violated the FBI's and the Department's media policy and constituted misconduct. The report delves into several other thorny issues of the 2016 campaign, including an Aug. 12, 2016, call to McCabe from a high-ranking Justice Department official who expressed concerns about the FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Bob Goodlatte, stated that his panel is already looking into these matters, and the report provides further evidence of the need to figure out what was going on at the Justice Department. The report is likely to fuel President Trump's complaints about the FBI, the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into his own behavior and that of his 2016 campaign, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mr. Mueller.\n\nThe new report is not directly related to Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, indictments against Russian nationals and Trump campaign officials, or the conduct of federal investigators. However, it is expected to fuel President Trump's ongoing criticisms of the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\nThe report's findings and the circumstances surrounding McCabe's firing are likely to remain a topic of debate and investigation, with differing perspectives emerging from political figures on both sides of the aisle.",
    " Title: Bloomberg News Imposes Restrictions on Investigating Presidential Candidate and Founder\n\nArticle:\n\nMike Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and former New York City mayor, has implemented a policy at Bloomberg News that prohibits the news service from investigating him, his family, and his foundation, as well as his Democratic competitors, in order to avoid any perceived conflict of interest. This policy has been met with criticism from some former employees, who argue that it compromises the organization's journalistic independence.\n\nThe policy, announced by editor-in-chief John Micklethwait, states that Bloomberg News will continue its tradition of not investigating the founder, and this prohibition will extend to his Democratic competitors because \"We can not treat Mike's Democratic competitors differently.\" This means that everyone from Joe Biden to Bernie Sanders to Cory Booker to Bloomberg himself is off-limits for investigation.\n\nHowever, the team will continue to investigate the Trump administration as the government of the day. The policy has been criticized as favoring Bloomberg and disadvantaging his rivals, while also compromising the organization's journalistic integrity.\n\nWhen Mike Bloomberg flirted with a 2016 presidential run, Kathy Kiely, the political editor of Bloomberg News at the time, resigned because of the same policy. Kiely stated that she felt that the organization was compromised as a result of the policy, and that it compromised her as an editor. Megan Murphy, Bloomberg's former Washington bureau chief, also criticized the policy, calling it \"ridiculous\" and \"not journalism.\"\n\nThe policy also affects Bloomberg Opinion, with the two top editors, Tim O'Brien and David Shipley, taking leaves to join the Bloomberg campaign. The rest of the editorial board is being suspended, and the section will refuse to publish any outside op-ed on the 2020 campaign.\n\nBloomberg News has assigned a reporter to follow the Bloomberg campaign, writing about speeches, policies, and polls. The initial story on the launch stated that the candidate is \"offering his own mix of moderate policy stances and experience in business, government, and philanthropy as the way to beat President Donald Trump.\" The editor-in-chief has stated that he does not want to lay down too many rules, and will reassess the situation if Bloomberg wins the nomination.\n\nThis policy has been compared to William Randolph Hearst's use of his newspapers to promote his 1904 presidential bid, but Bloomberg's company dwarfs that early 20th-century enterprise. Other media companies examine their owners or corporate parents with little fuss, with examples including The Washington Post reporting on Jeff Bezos and Amazon, and CNN having to cover Time Warner and now AT&T. It remains to be seen how this policy will impact Bloomberg News' reputation for journalistic independence.",
    " Title: Analysis of Political Loyalty and Tribalism in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe articles under discussion explore the concepts of political loyalty and tribalism in the United States political landscape. The first article, published by The Daily Beast, delves into the transformation of Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a figure once labeled as one of the nation's \"most corrupt.\" The piece criticizes Waters for her alleged abuse of office and her recent reception of standing ovations for her sharp attacks on President Trump.\n\nThe second article, a column titled \"Why Conservatives Still Attack Trump,\" is written by Dennis Prager, a columnist and radio talk-show host. In this piece, Prager attempts to understand the persistence of Republican resistance to President Trump.\n\nThe article on Waters criticizes those who advocate for overturning the Citizens United ruling, allowing state governments to ban political speech, for their hypocrisy in regards to free expression. It also questions the integrity of politicians who have proposed abandoning Fifth Amendment protections to confiscate guns, and those who oppose spying on American citizens based on the sitting president.\n\nThe piece on Prager's column discusses his position of \"AlwaysTrump,\" which encourages Republicans to support Trump despite his scandals, in the name of conservatism. The article questions the survival-of-the-nation narrative that underlies the opposition to Trump, and argues that there is no obligation to follow any individual, especially one with malleable principles.\n\nThe article concludes by acknowledging the existence of political tribalism, where individuals align themselves with political figures or ideologies, but suggests that the current political climate in Washington is marked by a high degree of unscrupulous behavior from various actors. The piece does not take a stance on the validity of the survival-of-the-nation narrative or the \"AlwaysTrump\" or \"NeverTrump\" positions, but instead presents both perspectives in a neutral and factual manner.",
    " Title: Hong Kong International Airport Cancels Flights Amid Ongoing Pro-Democracy Protests; Chinese Authorities Label Protests as \"Beginning to Show the Sprouts of Terrorism\"\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong International Airport, one of the world's busiest airports, suspended all flights on Monday following a large-scale occupation of the main terminal by pro-democracy demonstrators. Chinese authorities have likened the protest to \"terrorism.\"\n\nAccording to an official statement, the protests \"seriously disrupted\" airport operations. Only flights that were already boarding or had been cleared for landing were allowed to use the airport's runways. All other flights were canceled.\n\nThe city has been experiencing mass protests for over two months, urging democratic reforms and an investigation into police conduct. The Hong Kong government, which is supposed to be separate from communist China's influence, introduced an extradition bill that critics say would threaten the liberties awarded to the city and would allow people to be extradited to face the law in mainland China.\n\nThe bill was temporarily suspended following protests. However, the demonstrations have evolved from an uproar over the specific extradition proposal into a more general demand for greater freedoms and a check on the perceived use of excessive force by the authorities.\n\nChina on Monday used the strongest language yet to vilify the participants, with the Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in Beijing saying the protests are \"beginning to show the sprouts of terrorism\" and constitute an \"existential threat\" to the population of Hong Kong.\n\n\"One must take resolute action toward this violent criminality, showing no leniency or mercy,\" said a statement from spokesperson Yang Guang. \"Hong Kong has reached an inflection point where all those who are concerned about Hong Kong's future must say 'no,' to lawbreakers and 'no' to those engaged in violence.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Hong Kong police displayed water cannons that could be deployed in the case of future demonstrations. Amnesty International has warned that the misuse of these cannons within the densely-populated city's confined spaces could lead to serious injuries.\n\nHong Kong is a former British colony that has been part of China since 1997, but benefits from autonomy, crediting a \"one country, two systems\" approach. This structure allows the city certain democratic rights that are not afforded to people on the mainland, but in recent years, some people have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of slowly stripping their freedoms.\n\nMa Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post that heavy-handed tactics from police have alienated people.\n\n\"They have lost confidence in the police enforcing the law fairly and would question the legitimacy of all their actions,\" he said. \"They no longer think it's reasonable to blindly obey the law when there is no punishment for the officers' wrongdoings.\"",
    " Title: Iowa's Presidential Field: Two Progressive Contenders Face Potential Vote Splitting Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent rallies at the Iowa State Fair, Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders drew large crowds, with supporters chanting their names, waving signs, and cheering at their every pledge. Both candidates share similar stances on issues such as universal healthcare, taking on Wall Street, and raising the minimum wage.\n\nAs the two candidates have robust, well-funded campaigns and strong claims on Iowa, which hosts the first Democratic presidential nominating contest in February, some voters are concerned about the potential for a vote split on the left, with the two popular progressives running head-to-head, to the benefit of a centrist candidate like former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSherma Mather, a 50-year-old visitor from Richmond, Virginia, supporting Warren, expressed her concerns, stating, \"Of course it concerns me.\" Early opinion polls have consistently shown Biden in the lead, with either Sanders or Warren in second place.\n\nAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), an advocacy group that supports Warren, described Sanders and Warren as a \"1-2 punch\" with a \"gravitational pull\" on the rest of the field.\n\nTwenty-four Democrats are currently competing to secure their party's nomination and challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 general election. Sanders and Warren have maintained that they are friends, not rivals, and have so far stayed true to their pledge not to attack each other for political gain.\n\nIn Iowa, recent polls show Warren in second place with 21% of the vote, trailing Biden by just seven percentage points. Sanders had dropped to 9% in the state, according to the poll. Sanders' campaign advisers have criticized the poll as flawed due to an alleged undersampling of Sanders' supporters.\n\nNationally, the situation is better for Sanders, with Sanders and Warren neck-and-neck behind Biden. The most recent \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll had Sanders in second place by a wide margin over Warren.\n\nAlexis Johnson, a 33-year-old resident of Des Moines, expressed her support for Sanders, stating, \"Beating Trump is my top priority as a voter, and I have little enthusiasm for Warren.\" However, Misty Cornelius, a 38-year-old Des Moines resident with a Sanders tattoo, suggested Warren might be a better choice against Trump, stating, \"Bernie has been stigmatized. Warren is a fresh face.\"\n\nDespite sharing many of the same talking points, the two candidates have noticeable differences in their stump speeches. Warren casts herself as a sort of prairie populist, while Sanders talks more in terms of leading a \"movement.\" There is also evidence that the two do not chase the same kind of voters.\n\nPatrick Murray, the polling director at Monmouth, stated, \"While there is ideological overlap, Warren's recent surge has her pulling support away from virtually every other candidate, not just Sanders.\" Sanders' campaign views Biden as their primary challenge, as both are courting the kind of working-class voters and union voters who gravitated to Trump in 2016.\n\nBiden did little in Iowa to boost his status as a front-runner, making several gaffes, including a sensitive slip-up when he said \"poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids\" in a speech. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California ranked third in the state in the Monmouth poll with 11% support.\n\nRight now, the primary concern of the two campaigns is not to siphon support off the other. Instead, they both want to convince large swaths of voters that a progressive Democrat can win the election against Trump. Many Warren voters, like Mather of Richmond, fear Sanders will not yield if his fellow senator continues to gain momentum.",
    " Title: Trump and Kudlow Dismiss Recession Concerns, Offer Optimistic Outlook on Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, have offered an optimistic outlook on the U.S. economy, dismissing concerns of a potential recession. In a series of interviews over the weekend, both Trump and Kudlow expressed confidence in the economy's performance, particularly in the second half of 2019.\n\nTrump, returning from his New Jersey golf club on Sunday, stated, \"I don't think we're having a recession.\" He attributed the economy's strength to the tax cuts he implemented and the increased spending power of consumers. Kudlow, in interviews on Sunday television, echoed this sentiment, stating, \"We're doing pretty darn well in my judgment.\"\n\nConsumer confidence has dropped 6.4% since July, and a slowing energy sector has been acknowledged. However, Kudlow believes low interest rates will help sectors such as housing, construction, and auto sales.\n\nKudlow also defended Trump's use of tariffs on goods coming from China, stating that the \"China story has to be changed and reformed.\" This stance contrasts with Kudlow's previous career as an economic analyst, during which he was known for opposing tariffs and promoting free trade.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke expressed concerns about the ongoing trade war with China, stating, \"This current trade war that the president has entered our country into is not working.\" He fears it is driving the global economy into a recession and is causing significant harm to farmers across the country.\n\nLast month, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark rate, the first such reduction since December 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed concern about the consequences of Trump's trade war and sluggish economies overseas.\n\nBreaking with historical norms, Trump has been critical of Powell, placing blame for any economic weakness on the nation's central bank for raising interest rates too much over the past two years. Peter Navarro, who advises Trump on trade policy, shared this sentiment.\n\nNavarro also stated that U.S. consumers are not affected by the administration's trade war with China, though tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers, not by China, and are often passed along to U.S. businesses and consumers through higher prices. Kudlow himself previously stated that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately end up paying the tariffs that the administration imposes on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.\n\nTrump acknowledged at least a potential impact of the tariffs, pausing a planned 10% tariff hike for many items coming from China during the Christmas season. Navarro, however, stated, \"There's no evidence whatsoever that American consumers are bearing any of this.\"\n\nKudlow was interviewed on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and \"Fox News Sunday.\" O'Rourke spoke on NBC, and Navarro appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union\" and CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Trump's trade war with China has been a target of criticism by Democrats vying to challenge him in 2020. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, a Democratic presidential candidate, stated, \"There is clearly no strategy for dealing with the trade war in a way that will actually lead to results for American farmers or American consumers.\" He believes that increasing tariffs will not compel China to change its economic approach.",
    " Title: Justice Department Seeks Stay of Emergency Contraceptive Ruling, Faces Two-Step Review Process\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Justice will appear before a federal judge on Tuesday in an attempt to suspend a controversial ruling that would make emergency contraceptives available to young teenage girls without a prescription in the coming days. The ruling, made by U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman of New York on April 5, was initially set to take effect on Monday but has been delayed until Friday.\n\nIn a letter, Judge Korman has given the plaintiffs until Monday to respond to the notice of appeal filed by the Justice Department earlier this week. The ongoing debate over minors' access to the morning-after pill is testing the loyalty of groups traditionally among the biggest supporters of President Obama, who stated on Thursday that he is \"comfortable\" with his administration's efforts to find a middle ground on the issue.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius decided in 2011 to keep age restrictions on the pill in place, and women's rights groups have criticized the administration's decision to appeal Judge Korman's ruling, arguing that access to emergency contraception is suitable for all ages. Pro-life groups, who typically criticize the Democratic president, have cheered the decision to fight Judge Korman's ruling, although they did not approve of the FDA's decision on Tuesday to allow girls as young as 15 to obtain the drug without a prescription, a change from the prior age limit of 17.\n\nThe Obama administration maintains that the FDA's lowering of the age was due to an application from the pill's maker, Teva Women's Health Inc., and not related to the pending federal case. However, attorneys from Justice have noted the 15-year-old threshold now covers all the girls involved in the case, a move the plaintiffs' attorneys deemed suspicious.\n\nJudge Korman has indicated he will give the government two chances to put his ruling on ice. \"The parties are also advised that, in the event that I deny a stay pending appeal, I will grant a stay to allow the defendants to seek a stay from the Court of Appeals,\" his letter said."
