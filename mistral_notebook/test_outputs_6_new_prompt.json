    " Title: Senate Postpones Vote on Unemployment Insurance Extension Due to Weather-Related Absences\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Senate postponed a key procedural vote on a proposal to extend long-term unemployment insurance affecting some 1.3 million Americans due to the absence of more than a dozen lawmakers caused by travel delays due to bad weather. The vote, which was scheduled for Monday evening, has been rescheduled for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe bill to extend long-term unemployment benefits is the first partisan showdown in Congress for 2014. Backers of the bill are nearing the 60 votes they need to clear the procedural vote, with four Republicans and 55 members of the Democratic caucus expected to vote to begin debate on the bill. However, this is still one vote shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster.\n\nThe extension of benefits is a political priority for congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama, who is trying to make income equality a centerpiece of his second term. Obama has reached out to several GOP senators to try to persuade them to support the bill.\n\nMany Republicans argue that a $6.4 billion extension would hurt the economy and act as a disincentive to job creation. Others have signaled they might back an extension if the cost is offset elsewhere in the budget.\n\nSen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, a Republican who often works across the aisle, missed a call from Obama because he was not in the office. Kirk said he wants to help people but insisted Congress must find a way to pay for the measure.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is one of the four Republicans who said she would vote to begin debate on the bill. However, she would not rule out blocking it later if cost offsets are not added.\n\nThe other three Republicans are Dean Heller of Nevada, a co-sponsor of the bill, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.\n\nDemocrats see themselves in a win-win position on the test vote. They could build momentum for the bill if Republicans back it. They get a political weapon if Republicans do not. In remarks just before the vote was to have been held, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, noted that 17 members were not in the chamber and urged that the proceedings be delayed \"so we can have a real debate\" and decide how to pay for the extension.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike were delayed by rough winter weather that plunged the Midwest and much of the South into a deep freeze, triggering widespread travel delays. Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted that his commuter flight to Washington returned to South Carolina shortly after takeoff due to a possible engine problem and made a safe emergency landing.\n\nBenefits for the long-term unemployed expired last month after Congress opted not to continue a 2008 recession-era law providing nearly a year of payments, footed by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. Democrats insist the program is critical to help Americans who are struggling and to maintain the economic recovery. Republicans argue that the program is costly and is a disincentive to looking for work. The U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7% in November, the most recent Labor Department statistics show. That means more than 10 million people were out of work, a third of them without a job for at least 27 weeks.\n\nOver the weekend, key Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, insisted that an extension must include cuts elsewhere to offset the cost. House Speaker John Boehner will insist on such offsets before agreeing to an extension, a spokesman for the Republican leader said. During his weekly address over the weekend, President Obama underscored that failing to pass an extension could result in a drag on the economy.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Administration's Response to Coronavirus Outbreak, Discusses Economic Growth and Judicial Appointments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a town hall event, President Donald Trump defended his administration's response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, contrasting it with the Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Trump claimed that his administration had been given \"tremendous marks\" for closing the border to foreign nationals from China, where the outbreak originated, and for the relatively low number of infections in the U.S.\n\nWhen asked for a long-term plan to tackle the outbreak, Trump said, \"We have plans for every single possibility.\" He also pivoted the discussion to highlight economic growth under his administration, touting the rising Dow Jones index in the face of the virus, despite financial market volatility.\n\nTrump also used the town hall to discuss his judicial appointments, asserting that his predecessor, President Obama, left him a slew of vacancies to fill. He claimed that he had appointed about 200 federal judges since taking office. However, it is important to note that Republicans in the Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, filibustered dozens of Obama-appointed judges, stalling them in the Senate.\n\nTrump also addressed the rising national debt, which he had promised to pay off within eight years while running as a candidate in 2016. He contended that he had to let the debt go up as he went about rebuilding the military, which he argued Obama had left underfunded and in disarray.\n\nThe rapidly dwindling Democratic field also came up in the town hall, with Trump commenting on the potential challenges posed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. He noted that Sanders would be a formidable challenger due to his loyal base, and criticized Warren for dropping out after Super Tuesday, stating that she had split the progressive vote to the detriment of Sanders.\n\nTrump closed the town hall with an unusual message of respect for his fellow Washington insiders, diverging from his \"drain the swamp\" message to praise the \"great people\" in Washington, both Democrats and Republicans. He added that many Democrats were on board to collaborate with him in the coming years, despite a faction he called the \"radical left Democrats.\"\n\nWhen asked how he could bring a fractured America together again, Trump bragged about his administration's accomplishments, despite constant pushback from his adversaries. He added that he believed many Democrats would collaborate with him in the coming years.",
    " Title: Republican Party to Maintain Radicalism Despite Midterm Elections, as Government Shutdown Threats Resurface\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the midterm elections, the Republican Party is poised to maintain its recent ideological and procedural radicalism, as demonstrated by the resurfacing of government shutdown threats. This development comes just over two weeks after the elections, which Republican leadership had promised would bring an end to gridlock and partisan warfare.\n\nThe catalyst for this development is President Obama's long-promised executive orders on immigration reform, aimed at reducing deportations. In response, a bloc of at least 50 Republicans in Congress is reportedly maneuvering to thwart these orders by attaching language to \"must-pass\" legislation, which is necessary to fund the government.\n\nRepresentative Matt Salmon, the chief organizer of the push, told the Wall Street Journal, \"If we have an opportunity to actually do something rather than complain... why shouldn't we?\" This move, if successful, could potentially lead to another government shutdown, a tactic that has been used in the past to pressure the administration on various issues.\n\nNotably, the Tea Party, a conservative faction within the Republican Party, has been vocal in its opposition to the president's executive orders. Red State's Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative voice, called for the closure of government-controlled golf courses and the use of Camp David as a refugee holding facility in response to the executive orders.\n\nDespite these aggressive responses, the voice of Senator Ted Cruz, a prominent Tea Party figure and potential presidential candidate, has been notably absent. This could suggest that Cruz is assessing his influence within the Republican Senate, given his immense popularity among the Tea Party.\n\nIn the past, Cruz has been an outspoken critic of the government and has advocated for aggressive measures, including a government shutdown during the 2013 debt ceiling crisis. His lack of public commentary on the current situation may indicate a strategic approach, as he gauges the level of support for such actions within the new Senate.\n\nThis development suggests that the era of government by crisis, marked by debt ceiling standoffs, government shutdowns, and other contentious issues, is not over. Instead, it appears that the Republican Party, particularly its more conservative elements, is prepared to continue this approach in the new Congress.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Foreign Tour Begins Rocky in Britain\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's foreign tour, starting in Britain, has faced a series of public relations challenges that were not anticipated. The initial controversy arose from comments attributed to an anonymous campaign adviser in a British newspaper, suggesting that Romney understood the shared \"Anglo-Saxon heritage\" between the U.S. and Britain in a way President Obama did not. These comments were viewed as racist by some and were subsequently disowned by the Romney campaign.\n\nThe candidate himself caused a stir by expressing concerns about security and other issues in the lead-up to Friday's opening ceremony. His comments were perceived as doubting the eventual success of the games, stating, \"You know, it's hard to know just how well it will turn out.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron responded with a comment reminiscent of Winston Churchill, \"We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world. Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere.\" The implication was clear: the 2002 games Romney oversaw in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nAfter a meeting with Romney at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, Romney retracted his earlier remarks, expressing confidence in the games. However, this walk-back appeared to come too late, as London's mayor, Boris Johnson, used Romney's earlier comment to rally tens of thousands of Londoners before the opening ceremonies.\n\nJohnson stated, \"I hear there's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we're ready. Are we ready? Yes we are. Our venues are ready. The stadium is ready. The aquatic center is ready... the security is ready... and our athletes are ready.\"\n\nIn addition to the initial controversy, Romney breached British protocol by publicly disclosing a meeting with Sir John Sawers, the head of the British intelligence agency known as MI6. Such meetings are typically not acknowledged, according to British news outlets.\n\nThis three-nation trip, including Poland and Israel, was intended to demonstrate Romney's foreign policy expertise and global stature. However, it seems the tour is not getting off to the best start.\n\nThe liberal-leaning British newspaper The Guardian and the conservative-leaning Daily Telegraph both covered the British reaction to Romney during his visit. It appears there may be something about the British that causes American politicians to stumble, as they say in London.\n\nEarly in President Obama's time in the White House, he gave then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown a set of 25 DVDs of classic American movies that were incorrectly formatted to work on European players. Worse yet, at least by British standards, was the iPod loaded with American music that Obama gave Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe British press also looked askance at a gift from President George W. Bush of a bomber jacket to the same rather buttoned-down, aforementioned Brown.",
    " Title: President Obama Unilaterally Increases Minimum Wage for Federal Contract Workers to $10.10 per Hour\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move tied to his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama will unilaterally increase the minimum wage for workers under new federal contracts to $10.10 per hour, from the current rate of $7.25. This action is aimed at building momentum for a minimum wage hike for all Americans.\n\nThe executive order, which has been advocated by progressive Democratic lawmakers, applies to all contractors performing services for the federal government and is expected to affect more than 2 million employees, according to an administration official.\n\nDuring Tuesday night's address, the president will press Congress to pass a Democratic plan to increase the overall federal minimum wage to $10.10 over three years, and then index it to inflation, while also raising the minimum wage for tipped workers.\n\nCritics of the minimum wage push argue that raising the rate could have an adverse effect, discouraging businesses from hiring more workers at a time when the government is trying to spur job growth. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell stated, \"We have a crisis in employment among young people right now, and generation 18 to 30, people that got out of college, are finding there are no jobs for them. The last thing we want to do is have even fewer jobs for younger people.\"\n\nHowever, the president is reviving the issue as he tries to focus again on the economy. Obama, who does not have the power to unilaterally raise the minimum wage for private sector workers, also used last year's State of the Union speech to call for a federal minimum wage hike.\n\n\"Let\u2019s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour,\" the president said to applause in his 2013 address.\n\nThe new executive order affects only future contracts, not existing ones, and would only apply to contract renewals if other terms of the agreement changed. As a result, the order would benefit far fewer workers than the number forecasted by advocates of federal contract employees.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner downplayed the impact the latest executive order would have. \"Let's understand something: this affects not one current contract, it only affects future contracts with the federal government. And so I think the question is, how many people, Mr. President will this executive action actually help? I suspect the answer is somewhere close to zero,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nIn December, Reps. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., and Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote the president urging him to take the \"bold step\" of signing an executive order to increase wages for federal contractors, GovExec.com reported.\n\nAt the time, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a lukewarm response when asked about the lawmakers' request, according to the report. \"This has always been done legislatively. And it has been done with support from Republicans and not just Democrats in the past,\" Carney said.\n\nObama, in an effort to avoid the appearance of being a lame duck president, is expected to use Tuesday's State of the Union address to make clear his intentions to use his executive powers to achieve his goals when Congress fails to pass legislation.\n\nMinimum wage is a perennial issue that has taken on a higher profile amid the slowly recovering economy and growing public debate about income inequality. A Quinnipiac University poll this month found 71 percent of Americans in favor of raising the minimum wage\u2014including more than half of Republicans polled.\n\nFive states passed minimum wage measures last year, and advocates hope that number will grow as states from New Hampshire to Washington consider proposals. Many would push families above the federal poverty line, which is $15,730 for a family of two. In Iowa, a bill would hike the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10.\n\nDemocrats across the political spectrum have lobbied for a higher minimum wage this year, after Obama got the ball rolling on the issue by calling for an increase in his February budget speech. Since then, union-organized demonstrations in front of profitable mega-chains such as Wal-Mart and McDonald's have kept it in the public eye.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses James Comey of Leaking Classified Information; Allegations Surround Former FBI Director's Memos\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday accused former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified material, following a report that more than half of the memos Comey wrote detailing Russia-related conversations with the president contained classified information. The Hill, citing \"officials familiar with the documents,\" reported that Comey penned a total of seven memos describing his talks with Trump on the Russia case earlier this year, and four of them had markings indicating they contained classified material at the \"secret\" or \"confidential\" level.\n\nAccording to the report, the memos were recently shown to Congress, and the FBI claimed they were all government documents, despite Comey's description of his notes as personal. The president tweeted, \"James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!\"\n\nThe claims in The Hill regarding Comey's memos are reminiscent of the same kind of allegations against former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom Comey's team investigated for mishandling classified material on her private server and email.\n\nThe report comes as Trump and his family are grappling with a New York Times report that Donald Trump Jr. and other members of the president's inner circle met last summer with a Russian lawyer with the expectation of getting \"damaging information\" on Clinton \u2013 information that, according to Trump's son, did not materialize.\n\nA special counsel has been tasked with investigating Russian meddling in the campaign and possible collusion with Trump associates, ever since Trump fired Comey earlier this year. On the heels of that firing, Comey first admitted in congressional testimony that he had used an old friend at Columbia University to get his notes leaked to The New York Times about his discussions with Trump.\n\nHowever, when asked about the latest claims, Columbia University professor Daniel Richman \u2013 the Comey friend who leaked part of one memo to The New York Times \u2013 told Fox News on Monday that \"this is a non-story.\" Richman explained that no memos were given to the press, and no memos were classified at the time he received them. Richman questioned the White House claims.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller's office declined to comment on the ongoing investigation when asked about the report in The Hill. White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway called the latest report an \"incredible bombshell\" and said that, if the account is true, Comey was at least violating FBI rules. Conway added that Comey was \"admitting under oath, handing over classified information through 'private recollection,'\" and that this was what the story should be \u2013 not all this nonsense about Russian collusion and whatnot.",
    " Title: Senate Health Care Bill Faces Setback as Two Republican Senators Withdraw Support\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate health care bill has once again stalled after two conservative Republican senators announced last night that they would not vote to advance the legislation due to its failure to repeal enough of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The bill, which was assembled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell through a secretive process, would lead to 22 million more Americans being uninsured by the end of the decade, primarily due to cuts to Medicaid, and many who retain insurance under the bill would pay more for fewer benefits.\n\nThe bill was amended after the Congressional Budget Office offered this assessment, but the GOP decided not to wait for a new score before moving forward. Democratic senators are universally opposed to the legislation, while the most moderate and conservative Republicans have also refused to sign on, either because it does too much or too little to move away from Obamacare's improvements to the health care system.\n\nThe lack of a clear policy vision from President Donald Trump and his administration has left his media supporters struggling to formulate a coherent response to the bill's setbacks. Last night, Trump tweeted that \"Republicans should just REPEAL failing Obamacare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!\" However, this tactical messaging ignores the question of what a good health care plan would look like and whether the Senate bill that just went down in flames met that criteria.\n\nWithout a clear policy vision, Trump's media allies have been left to their own devices. Some of Trump's propagandists argue that Trump can not fail; he can only be failed. As such, they have quickly turned their fire on McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI).\n\nFox host Kimberly Guilfoyle said last night, \"I know the president is frustrated with the situation. A lot has been promised to him and not much delivered.\" She continued, \"I think this is a failure on the part of the leadership, to be quite honest. Because they needed to get this to stick and to coalesce and get it done.\"\n\nSteve Doocy added on Fox & Friends this morning, \"Ultimately, what undid this bill is -- the one that they are not going to vote on now -- is it was a lousy bill. I mean, it still had big taxes. It still had a lot of regulations. It had that insurance company subsidy slush fund that Rand Paul was talking about. It was not what the American people wanted.\"\n\nIf the Senate bill continues to struggle, and Trump does not publicly support McConnell, we could see calls for his replacement in the near future. Trump's lack of interest in policy leaves his supporters plenty of room to say that they didn't like the bill, without creating any dissonance about the fact that the president supported the legislation.\n\nOne of the problems Senate Republicans faced in trying to push through health care legislation is that, because they knew no bill would attract enough Democratic support to overcome a filibuster, they were trying to pass the bill with a 50-vote threshold through the budget reconciliation process. However, that process limits what can actually go into the bill, making full repeal of Obamacare extremely difficult.\n\nIn order to sidestep that process, the hosts of Fox & Friends are calling for Senate Republicans to deploy the \"nuclear option\" and eliminate the filibuster altogether, making all votes subject only to a majority vote. It's unclear how this would help pass a health care bill since Republicans just demonstrated they don't have 50 votes in the Senate. However, this morning, Doocy, co-host Brian Kilmeade, and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer all seemed eager to push through that proposal.\n\nA few hours later, Trump, who regularly watches Fox & Friends, chimed in, tweeting, \"The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!\"",
    " Title: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders Speaks at NetRoots Nation Conference, Faces Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a speech to an audience of approximately 11,000 activists at the Phoenix Convention Center, marking his largest speaking engagement to date. The event coincided with the annual gathering of NetRoots Nation, a national meeting of thousands of leftist activists, bloggers, and special interests.\n\nDuring a town-hall style panel earlier in the day, both Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley faced protests from around 40 \"Black Lives Matter\" activists. Tia Oso, an activist, seized the microphone and stated, \"We are going to hold this space and acknowledge the names of black women who have died in police custody, and then Governor O'Malley we do have questions for you!\" She continued, \"As leader of this country, will you advance an agenda that will dismantle structural racism in this country?\"\n\nBoth O'Malley and Sanders, who are known for their leftist politics, seemed taken aback by the exchange. In part of his response, O'Malley said that \"all lives matter,\" a statement he later apologized for, stating that he was sorry if the phrase \"offended\" anyone.\n\nSanders, amidst a torrent of jeers, turned to the moderator and asked, \"What are you doing here?\" and \"Are you in charge here?\"\n\nThe twin events on Saturday demonstrate the promise and pitfalls of the growing agitation among hard-core leftist activists. On the one hand, their attendance helped fuel Sanders' largest campaign event to date, providing an important backdrop for the media coverage that has powered his rise in the polls. On the other hand, the palpable anger among these most committed activists, stoked over the years by the explicit design of President Obama and national Democrats, is taking over the party. It is driving the national party not only into the far fringes of leftist philosophy but also a deep embrace of identity politics that is likely to alienate most voters.\n\nOne Black Lives Matter protester later explained, \"It's not like we like shutting things down, but we have to. We are tired of being interrupted.\"",
    " Title: American Commando Raid Results in Death of Journalist Luke Somers and Civilians in Yemen\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American commando raid in Yemen's southern province of Shabwah on Saturday resulted in the death of American journalist Luke Somers and at least eight civilians, according to various sources. Somers, a freelance journalist who had been kidnapped in Yemen's capital, Sana'a, in 2013, was the focus of a rescue mission due to an ultimatum set by his militant captors to kill him by Saturday if unspecified demands were not met.\n\nThe operation, led by United States Special Operations commandos, aimed to rescue Somers and another Western hostage held in a walled compound in the village. According to a senior military official, American intelligence, including spy satellites, surveillance drones, and eavesdropping technology, had pinpointed the location of Somers and the other hostage inside the compound.\n\nThe raid, which began at about 1 a.m., faced several challenges. The compound, located in a remote, hilly area, was guarded by about half a dozen gunmen, already jittery about a possible repeat of the previous rescue attempt. The approach to the compound was difficult, and the commandos had virtually no element of surprise, which they typically plan for and rely on. The commandos were detected when they were less than 100 yards from the compound. It is unclear what alerted the militants.\n\nIn the village, a tribal leader, Tarek al-Daghari al-Awlaki, stated that the American commandos raided four houses, killing at least two militants but also eight civilians. One of the civilians killed was a 70-year-old man. The shooting caused panic, and nine of the dead are from Mr. Daghari's tribe.\n\nThe operation on Saturday marked the latest in a series of global combat missions led by America's Special Operations forces since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. However, the challenges of distance, weather, equipment failure, pinpoint intelligence, and unpredictable actions by the adversary are ever-present. A raid in July by Special Operations forces against an Islamic State safe house in Syria also failed to free American hostages, who apparently had been relocated in advance of the mission.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the killings represented a larger shift in the tactics of Al Qaeda, which has largely turned away from executing hostages in recent years in favor of negotiating ransoms. When they have faced military raids, Al Qaeda militants have executed hostages. The operation on Saturday seems to have been carried out due to the deadline set by the militant captors to kill Somers on Saturday.",
    " Title: Cleveland Police Rescue Three Women Held Captive for Decades\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, three women who had been missing for over a decade were found alive in a house near downtown Cleveland on Monday. The women, identified as Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight, were kidnapped in their teens or early 20s and were held captive in the house.\n\nThe rescue began with a frantic 911 call from Amanda Berry, who pleaded for help to reach the police. A neighbor, Charles Ramsey, heard the commotion and saw Berry trying to escape from a house. He helped her get outside, and within minutes, police arrived and took the other women from the house.\n\nAmanda Berry, who disappeared at age 16 in 2003, made a 911 call in which she identified herself and explained that she had been kidnapped and had been missing for 10 years. Gina DeJesus, who was 14 when she vanished in 2004, and Michelle Knight, who disappeared in 2002, were also found.\n\nAuthorities arrested three brothers in connection with the case, but no names or charges have been released. One of the brothers lived at the house, while the others lived elsewhere. The women appeared to be in good health and were taken to a hospital for evaluation and to be reunited with their families.\n\nA 6-year-old child was also found in the house, but the child's identity and relationship to the residents are not known. The women's loved ones expressed their joy and relief at their rescue.\n\nThe house where the women were found was being searched by dozens of police officers and sheriff's deputies. The homeowner, who is believed to be Ariel Castro, a former school bus driver, was arrested and is being held in jail. Attempts to reach Ariel Castro were unsuccessful.\n\nThe women's disappearance had taken a toll on their families, and their loved ones had not given up hope of seeing them again. The rescue of the three women has brought a sense of relief and joy to the community.\n\nThe investigation into the case is ongoing, and there are many unanswered questions. The women are currently being evaluated at a hospital, and their conditions are not being disclosed. This is a developing story, and more information is expected to be released at a news conference scheduled for Tuesday morning.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Criticizes Bill Clinton's Record, Calls for Apology Over \"Super Predator\" Remark\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a forum centered on race at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticized parts of former President Bill Clinton's record and called for an apology over his use of the phrase \"super predator\" in the 1990s.\n\nDuring the event, Sanders expressed sharp differences with Clinton's handling of crime and poverty during his two-term presidency. He also rebuked Clinton for defending his wife's use of the \"super predator\" term, which he said was code for \"black people.\"\n\n\"The president owes the American people an apology for trying to defend what is indefensible,\" Sanders said.\n\nWhen someone in the audience at the Apollo shouted that the \"super predator\" reference was code for \"black people,\" the Vermont senator said, \"That's exactly right.\"\n\nSanders and Hillary Clinton are competing to win the New York primary on April 19. Having performed poorly with minority voters in earlier contests, Sanders has been trying to forge stronger ties to the African-American community as the campaign moves to diverse states like New York. The event at the Apollo was one such effort, with Sanders sharing a stage with African-American supporters including entertainer Harry Belafonte and Erica Garner, daughter of Eric Garner, who died two years ago in a struggle with police who put him in a choke hold.\n\nWhen asked about Hillary Clinton, Belafonte, who is also a civil-rights activist, said, \"Hillary who? We've been there and done that.\"\n\nThe first question Sanders received from the moderator involved Clinton's extended back-and-forth with a pair of protesters in Philadelphia on Thursday. In that exchange, Clinton sought to explain his wife's use of the term \"super predator.\" He talked about gang leaders who were getting teenagers \"hopped up on crack\" and sending them out to kill other African-Americans.\n\n\"Maybe you thought they were good citizens; she didn't,\" Clinton told the protesters.\n\nIn the same event, Clinton also defended a bill he signed as president in 1996 overhauling the welfare system by imposing limitations on federal assistance and enacting new work requirements. When protesters said the welfare law increased poverty, Clinton said, \"Then why did we have the largest drop in African-American poverty in history when I was president?\" He blamed Republicans for subsequently undercutting the program by yanking money intended to cushion the law's impact.\n\nSanders was unsparing in his criticism of the welfare legislation, casting it as a cynical ploy to win votes.\n\n\"Do you all remember that?\" he asked the audience. \"The premise, which was a right-wing Republican premise, was that the problem was all these people were really living high off the hog.\"\n\nA consequence of the new law was that \"extreme poverty \u2026 went up,\" Mr. Sanders said.\n\nClinton signed the law as he was campaigning for re-election in 1996.\n\n\"Here are people who are helpless, who are barely making it economically,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"To go after them to win votes and cut the benefits of children and moms is unacceptable.\"\n\nClinton's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A day after his clash with the protesters, Clinton voiced regrets over the episode. He said he was not especially \"effective\" in dealing with the criticism.",
    " Title: US-Iran Nuclear Deal and Iran's Foreign Policy: A Look at the Complexities\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing US-led nuclear deal with Iran primarily focuses on Iran's nuclear program and does not address broader issues concerning Iran's relationship with the world. The debate surrounding the deal has revolved around Iran's role in the Middle East, with some arguing that the deal could embolden Iran's hostile stance, while others contend it could foster a more conciliatory foreign policy.\n\nJournalist Steve Coll, in a recent podcast on the New Yorker, compared Iran to Sunni Arab countries in the Middle East, which are predominantly pro-American but have populations that are deeply hostile towards the US. In contrast, Iran's elites are mostly hostile towards the US, while the population is ready for change.\n\nColl's observations were made during a visit to Iran on Quds Day, an annual event where hard-liners chant against Israel and America. He noted that many attendees were not genuine supporters but were students brought in for the event. He also mentioned that, despite the regime's anti-Western actions and rhetoric, the Iranian population is largely past the idea of a perpetual revolutionary struggle against foreign powers.\n\nHowever, the Iranian government has constituencies that believe in anti-Western policies, including security agencies, the clerical establishment, and hard-liners who wield significant influence. The Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has a history of bending to hard-liners, potentially due to his reliance on their support.\n\nThe comparison between Iran and Sunni Arab dictatorships is significant, as both have authoritarian elites with varying levels of support from their populations. This tension between Iran's anti-American elite and its more pro-normalization population is a challenge for the country's leadership and stability.\n\nThe instability of American foreign policy in the Middle East and the status quo in the region are highlighted by this contradiction. The things that make Iran's official anti-Americanism politically unviable in the long term hold true in Sunni Arab states, from Algeria to Bahrain.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Hears Arguments in Landmark Free Speech on the Internet Case, Elonis v. United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe nine justices of the Supreme Court heard arguments on Monday in a potentially significant case, Elonis v. United States, regarding free speech on the Internet. The case revolves around Anthony Elonis, who was convicted of making threats of violence and sentenced to nearly four years in prison for posting hostile messages on Facebook about his community and his then-estranged wife, after she obtained a protective order against him. Elonis claims his threats were not serious and were merely original rap lyrics.\n\nThe case is considered the first major test of free speech rights on the Internet, and the court's eventual ruling could apply to more traditional forms of communication. According to CNN correspondent Jan Crawford, after hearing complex and convoluted arguments from both Elonis' lawyers and government lawyers, the justices seemed skeptical of both sides.\n\nJohn Elwood, an attorney for Elonis, said after the arguments that he thought they went \"reasonably well\" but agreed the outcome would be \"very hard to tell.\" He stated that a victory for the government in this case could have far-reaching consequences for communications online, where the intent of one's message is not always clear.\n\nJeff Dion, deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said after Monday's arguments that the government made a strong case. Dion argued that throwing out Elonis' conviction would effectively \"make a rulebook on how to legally threaten your spouse.\" If Elonis wins, it would invalidate a majority of stalking statutes in the U.S., according to Dion.\n\nPaulette Sullivan Moore of the National Network to End Domestic Violence added that \"a threat is a threat,\" whether it comes via social media or otherwise. According to Scotusblog, the justices did not spend a lot of time analyzing whether the Internet was different from other forums of communication, although now and then a justice would throw in a presumably knowing reference to Eminem or to rappers more generally.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Plan to Name Supreme Court Nominee on July 9, Likely Candidates Revealed\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has announced his intention to announce his nominee for a new Supreme Court justice on July 9. During a flight from Washington to New Jersey on Friday, Trump stated that he has narrowed the potential candidates down to approximately five individuals, including two women. The vacancy arose following the retirement announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy earlier this week.\n\nThe president's nominee will need to be confirmed by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a narrow majority. Trump also discussed other political matters during the flight, including his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki next month, NATO spending, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nRegarding the WTO, Trump stated that the U.S. has been treated unfairly but did not mention any plans to withdraw from the organization. He also declined to discuss the Supreme Court candidates' positions on the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision, which legalized abortion in the U.S.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to appoint \"pro-life\" judges to the Supreme Court, a promise that has raised concerns among women's rights groups. Among the potential candidates, Brett Kavanaugh, an appeals court judge in Washington D.C. and a former clerk to Justice Kennedy, is considered a front-runner. Other likely nominees include Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame. Raymond Kethledge, a judge on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and a former clerk to Justice Kennedy, is another possible contender.\n\nIn other remarks to reporters, President Trump indicated that he would discuss allegations of Russian election meddling when he meets President Putin in Finland on July 16. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. election in Trump's favor, a claim the Kremlin has consistently denied. Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, which led to U.S. and EU sanctions, and the war in Syria, would also be discussed, according to Trump. He refused to rule out accepting the annexation when he meets Putin, stating, \"We're going to have to see.\" When asked whether U.S. sanctions on Russia might be lifted, Trump replied, \"We'll see what Russia does.\"",
    " Title: Trump Visits U.S.-Mexico Border, Threatens Tariffs on Mexican Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Calexico, California on Friday, reiterating his concerns about the influx of Central American migrants seeking asylum. Trump stated, \"We can't take you anymore. I'm sorry. Can't happen. So turn around,\" referring to the migrants.\n\nDuring a discussion with border officials, Trump criticized the asylum system, claiming that people are fabricating stories of violence at home to stay in the U.S. \"It's a scam. It's a hoax,\" Trump said. \"I know about hoaxes, I just went through a hoax.\"\n\nTrump's recent declaration of a border emergency aims to redirect funding for a border wall. He has been critical of the asylum system, with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen estimating that about 100,000 migrants crossed the border illegally or asked for refuge at legal border crossings in March, a level not seen in more than a decade.\n\nDespite the tough rhetoric, Trump has backed off a threat to close the border entirely, stating that Mexico has made progress in apprehending migrants and stopping their journey to the U.S. border. However, before leaving Washington, he reiterated a new threat: if the situation doesn't improve, he will impose tariffs of 25% on Mexican-made vehicles entering the U.S.\n\nTrump's nomination for Ron Vitiello, a veteran border official serving as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was withdrawn unexpectedly on Thursday. Trump commented, \"Ron's a good man, but we're going in a tougher direction.\" The move leaves the agency without a leader at a crucial time, and Trump didn't mention any potential replacements.\n\nTensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have risen due to Mexico's recent shift in migration policies. The administration of Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has begun offering humanitarian visas to Central American asylum seekers and has also cut back on deportations. The number of illegal immigrants detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection has risen in response.\n\nMexico hasn't commented on whether it has stepped up migrant apprehensions as Trump has asserted, but government officials have said they believe trade and migration issues should be kept separate. The U.S., Mexico, and Canada signed a new trade pact overhauling their 25-year-old trade zone in November, but the pact needs congressional approval and has encountered some opposition. Trump scoffed at the opposition as \"purely political.\"\n\nAfter the border tour, Trump was scheduled to hold a series of fundraisers in California and Nevada on Friday and Saturday and deliver a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference in Las Vegas.",
    " Title: U.S. and China: A Call for Collaboration in Achieving Mutual Dreams of Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a piece published recently, the author calls for President Barack Obama to support Chinese President Xi Jinping's efforts to achieve his vision of reform. The author recalls a personal encounter with Xi in 2012, where they discussed a photo album of Xi's father's 1980 visit to the United States, and notes similarities between Xi's \"Chinese dream\" and the aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nXi's \"Chinese dream\" encompasses goals such as poverty alleviation, national rejuvenation, and the eradication of corruption. The author suggests that when President Obama meets with Xi in California, they will have an opportunity to collaborate and define their shared vision for the future.\n\nDomestically, China has already begun to implement economic reforms, with Premier Li Keqiang committing to reducing government involvement in the economy and allowing market forces to guide growth. The National Development and Reform Commission has also proposed an absolute cap on greenhouse gas emissions and coal consumption. Xi's anti-corruption drive, his decision to follow in the footsteps of Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern trip, and his efforts to improve military-to-military relations with the United States are also indicative of his commitment to reform.\n\nInternationally, China is demonstrating a more responsible stance, with commitments to a denuclearized Korean peninsula, improved military-to-military relations, and progress on cyber hacking and auditing issues.\n\nThe author proposes several steps for the U.S. and China to take to further their relationship. They suggest that Obama and Xi should announce the commencement of negotiations for a free trade agreement with a three-year deadline for conclusion. They also recommend setting a one-year deadline for the completion of a bilateral investment treaty and the authorization of U.S. shale gas exports to China.\n\nProtection of intellectual property is another key issue, and the authors suggest establishing a bilateral task force to agree on specific policies that will ensure greater protection for intellectual property. Lastly, the authors propose that Obama should visit China within the next twelve months and address the Chinese people about his vision for the future of U.S.-China relations.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the importance of the U.S. and China working together to achieve their mutual dreams of reform and to create a new, more cooperative great power relationship. The author is Stephen A. Orlins, the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.",
    " Title: US Senate Committee Requests Second Investigation into Khashoggi's Murder, Focusing on Saudi Crown Prince\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee has requested a second investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The request, issued under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, was made by Republican Senator Bob Corker and Democrat Bob Menendez on behalf of the committee.\n\nThe letter, sent on Tuesday, calls for a specific investigation into the crown prince to \"determine whether a foreign person is responsible for an extrajudicial killing, torture or other gross violation\" of human rights. The request requires a response within 120 days.\n\nJamal Khashoggi was killed on October 2, 2018, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed Khashoggi's death on rogue agents but has denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. US media have reported that the CIA believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, President Donald Trump acknowledged that the crown prince \"could very well\" have known about Khashoggi's brutal murder, adding, \"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" He later stated that the CIA had not made a \"100%\" determination on the killing.\n\nFollowing the president's comments, the Saudi government has maintained that the death was the result of rogue agents and that the crown prince did not have knowledge of the operation.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, President Trump told Fox News that he had refused to listen to a recording of Khashoggi's murder provided by Turkey, calling it \"a suffering tape.\"\n\nThe request for a second investigation comes as many in the US Congress and other countries continue to call for greater clarity regarding the crown prince's role in the murder. Lindsey Graham, a senator from Mr. Trump's Republican Party, has predicted strong bipartisan support in Congress for sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including \"appropriate members of the royal family.\"\n\nIn a statement, President Trump wrote that \"we may never know all of the facts\" about Khashoggi's death and that the United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of the country, Israel, and other partners in the region. President Trump later said he would meet Mohammed bin Salman at a G20 meeting in Argentina next week if the crown prince attended.\n\nThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi has sparked international condemnation and has been a major crisis for Saudi Arabia. Many Saudis have expressed regret that the murder will cast a dark shadow over their country for many years to come. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted his disgust at the Trump statement, calling it disgraceful.",
    " Title: Stranded Americans in Yemen Await Evacuation as U.S. Weighs Safety Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nMuna Mansour, an American citizen from Buffalo, New York, is among dozens of Americans stranded in Yemen amidst ongoing conflict between warring parties. The United States has deemed it too dangerous to directly evacuate American nationals, leaving families like Mansour's in a precarious situation.\n\nMansour and her family of nine are currently cramped in a cargo hold with two other families, with limited resources and no clear plan for evacuation. Her grandchild sleeps curled around an oil drum during their journey from Aden to Djibouti.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began when Saudi Arabia, aiming to drive out the Shiite Houthi rebels, initiated airstrikes over three weeks ago. The Houthis, who had previously held Yemen's President under house arrest, have taken control of government buildings and some territory.\n\nThe bombings have caused significant damage in cities like Aden, trapping foreigners in the country. Muna recalls witnessing the evacuation of 200 Indians from the port, while American citizens remain stranded.\n\nThe State Department has stated that the security situation in Yemen makes an evacuation of citizens too risky. \"We have to make a decision based on the security situation and what is feasible to do,\" said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. \"Given the situation in Yemen is quite dangerous and unpredictable, doing something like sending in military assets even for an evacuation could put U.S. citizen lives at greater risk.\"\n\nA group of U.S. organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination League, have filed a lawsuit against the State Department and Defense Department over the government's stance on evacuations.\n\nMuna's ordeal began when she visited her sick father in Aden, only to find herself trapped in the city as fighting broke out around her. With Houthi forces to the north and the Gulf of Aden to the south, Aden is essentially besieged.\n\nMuna and her fellow Americans have waited for word on their evacuation, but to no avail. The first night on their boat had a festive air, but one woman was found crying, her 15-year-old son trapped on the other side of one of the many front lines that have etched themselves into the city's streets.\n\nU.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Christina Higgins met the stranded Americans at Djibouti Port. When asked about the sense of abandonment felt by the Americans, Higgins stated, \"We've had to weigh very, very carefully what is the safest way, the best way for us to help them.\"\n\nHiggins emphasized that each U.S. citizen will have to judge what is best for themselves and their families, with many choosing to shelter in place while others are being assisted in finding alternative means of travel out of Yemen.\n\nAs of now, there are no definitive records, but the 15 Americans on board the ship reported counting 75 more families waiting in Aden port who could not afford an \"exit/transport\" fee being charged to depart Aden. This fee, not an official tax, was being charged by local fishermen to ferry passengers to the boat to board.\n\nThe situation in Yemen remains dire for many American citizens still in danger, with no clear solution in sight.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Admits to Manipulating Online Polls at Donald Trump's Direction\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Michael Cohen, the former personal lawyer of U.S. President Donald Trump, admitted on Thursday to paying a data firm to manipulate online polling data \"at the direction of and for the sole benefit of\" Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen had paid the data firm RedFinch Solutions to manipulate two public opinion polls in favor of Trump before the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nCohen, in a Twitter post on Thursday, stated, \"As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it.\"\n\nThe attempts to influence the polls ultimately proved largely unsuccessful but shed light on the tactics of the Trump campaign and Cohen's role within it. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently referred to his polling numbers to help fuel his candidacy.\n\nCohen was sentenced last month to three years in prison for his role in making illegal hush-money payments to women to help Trump's campaign and for lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Russia. Cohen has said Trump had directed him to commit the campaign-finance violations, which Trump has denied.\n\nThe Journal said Cohen commissioned John Gauger, who runs RedFinch Solutions, to write a computer script to repeatedly vote for Trump in a February 2015 Drudge Report poll on potential Republican candidates. Trump ranked fifth in the Drudge Report poll, with about 24,000 votes, or 5 percent of the total, according to the Journal.\n\nCohen also commissioned Gauger to do the same for a 2014 CNBC online poll identifying the country's top business leaders, although Trump was unable to break into the top 100 candidates, the Journal reported.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the president has no knowledge of the polls being rigged. Trump tweeted about a CNBC poll on business leaders in 2014, calling it \"a joke\" and suggesting he was removed from the list because of \"politics.\"\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 was not immediately able to confirm the details of the newspaper report. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did representatives for RedFinch Solutions and the Trump Organization. Charles James, a lawyer for Gauger, declined to comment.\n\nGauger said Cohen paid him in cash out of a blue Walmart bag, although not for the total amount he was owed. Cohen also promised Gauger work on the Trump campaign that never materialized, according to the Journal.\n\nCohen worked for Trump for many years as his self-proclaimed fixer, and once said he would take a bullet for Trump. However, the relationship has since publicly soured. Trump has called Cohen a \"rat,\" while Cohen has cooperated with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia during the campaign. Both Trump and Moscow have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCohen has also agreed to testify publicly in front of the House of Representatives' Oversight Committee in a hearing scheduled to take place next month.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation of Michael Cohen's Business Dealings Revealed in Released Search Warrant\n\nArticle:\n\nThe FBI had been investigating President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, for nearly a year before agents raided his home and office, documents released Tuesday show. The search warrant, while heavily redacted, offered new details about the federal inquiry into Cohen's business dealings and the FBI raids of his Manhattan home and office.\n\nThe federal inquiry into Cohen had been going on since July 2017, far longer than previously known. Lanny Davis, an attorney for Cohen, stated that the release of the search warrant \"furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.\"\n\nThe FBI raided Cohen's Manhattan home and office last April, marking the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has threatened Trump's presidency and netted Cohen a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations. The federal agents, who also scoured Cohen's hotel room and safe deposit box, seized more than 4 million electronic and paper files in the searches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.\n\nBoth Cohen and Trump cried foul over the raids, with Cohen's attorney at the time calling them \"completely inappropriate and unnecessary,\" and the president taking to Twitter to declare that \"Attorney-client privilege is dead!\" A court-ordered review ultimately found only a fraction of the seized material to be privileged.\n\nThe raids on Cohen were triggered in part by a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is separately looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Tuesday's release of the search warrant came nearly six weeks after U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III partially granted a request by several media organizations, including The Associated Press, that the search warrant be made public due to the high public interest in the case.\n\nThe judge acknowledged prosecutors' concerns that a wholesale release of the document \"would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties,\" a ruling that revealed prosecutors are still investigating Cohen's illegal payments to two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump. The judge ordered prosecutors to redact Cohen's personal information and details in the warrant that refer to ongoing investigations and several third-parties who have cooperated with the inquiry. However, he authorized the release of details in the warrant that relate to Cohen's tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen's conduct that did not result in criminal charges.\n\n\"At this stage, wholesale disclosure of the materials would reveal the scope and direction of the Government's ongoing investigation,\" Pauley wrote in a ruling last month. Cohen pleaded guilty over the summer to failing to report more than $4 million in income to the IRS, making false statements to financial institutions, and campaign-finance violations stemming from the hush-money payments he arranged for porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen implicated Trump in his guilty plea, saying the president directed him to make the payments during his 2016 campaign.",
    " Title: College Students' Views on Free Speech: A Contradictory Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report on student views of free speech, published on May 5 by the Knight Foundation in partnership with Gallup, has raised concerns about the future of free speech in the United States, given the significant role colleges play in shaping the nation's leaders.\n\nThe report reveals a paradoxical trend: while an increasing number of students support restrictions on speech deemed offensive, they also believe that free speech and the First Amendment are under threat. The proportion of students who believe colleges should be able to restrict language containing slurs has risen from 69 percent in 2016 to 78 percent in 2019. Moreover, a surprising 71 percent (up from 63 percent) of students think colleges should be able to restrict the use of \"stereotypical costumes,\" a matter typically beyond the jurisdiction of college administrators.\n\nSimultaneously, however, a smaller proportion of students believe the First Amendment is secure\u201459 percent, compared to 73 percent in 2016. A majority of students also believe that the climate of their campus stifles free expression, while many acknowledge that liberals are freer to speak their mind than conservatives.\n\nThe seemingly contradictory findings suggest that large numbers of campus liberals are aware of the receding free speech in colleges and elsewhere, yet they continue to advocate for further speech restrictions. It is more likely that this paradox reflects a growing perception among liberals that \"hate speech\" and other insensitive forms of expression fall outside the bounds of protected free speech.\n\nThis is supported by the fact that staggering numbers of students continue to believe that \"hate speech\" is legally restricted. Only 30 percent of respondents answered affirmatively when asked if hate speech is protected by the First Amendment, with nearly half claiming that it is not. The outlook is even more dismal when examining Democrats, as only 23 percent know that hate speech is protected. While this could be interpreted as a mere misunderstanding of the First Amendment, it aligns with the large majorities in favor of college restrictions on insensitive forms of expression, implying that many college liberals believe their censorship preferences are also enshrined in law.\n\nAmerica's college students are its future politicians, media figures, teachers, and bureaucrats. Unfortunately, the report suggests that their tilt toward an authoritarian view of speech has only grown.",
    " Title: SNL Tackles Performative Activism: A Critique of Corporate and Individual Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nSaturday Night Live (SNL) addressed the topic of performative activism in its recent episode, critiquing both corporate and individual actions that may appear supportive of social causes but lack genuine commitment. The show's focus was on two sketches, one targeting the controversial Pepsi ad and another satirizing armchair activism.\n\nThe Pepsi ad, which featured Kendall Jenner joining a protest movement and offering a can of Pepsi to a police officer, was met with widespread criticism upon its release. In the SNL sketch, a fictional representative of the ad's creators, played by Beck Bennett, realizes the ad's tragic flaws, such as trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement, using diverse individuals as props, and ignoring historical police treatment of people of color.\n\nThe second sketch, \"Thank You, Scott,\" parodied armchair activism, where individuals express support for social causes through social media but do not engage in more substantial actions like making phone calls, writing letters, volunteering, or donating money. In the sketch, Louis CK's character, Scott, is praised for his minimal efforts, such as sharing an article on Facebook and adding \"Black Lives Matter\" to his Twitter bio.\n\nWhile the sketches serve as a reminder of the importance of genuine commitment and cultural sensitivity, they also highlight the challenges of navigating social issues in the digital age, where appearances can sometimes overshadow actual actions.",
    " Title: Trump Nominates Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Monday that he has chosen former campaign rival Ben Carson to become the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In a statement, Trump expressed his excitement about the nomination, praising Carson's intelligence and passion for strengthening communities.\n\nCarson, who had previously downplayed any role in the Trump administration, stated in a Monday statement that he felt he could \"make a significant contribution, particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need.\" He also tweeted that he would accept the position.\n\nAlthough Carson was rumored to be a contender for positions such as Veteran's Affairs, Education, or Health and Human Services, his nomination for HUD may initially seem unusual. However, Carson has spoken and written about the department and issues affected by its actions numerous times during his time as a primary candidate. He also hinted at a potential HUD job offer from Trump in a Facebook post last month.\n\nCarson ran against Trump during the Republican primary battle but endorsed the businessman after dropping out of the White House race in March. He became one of Trump's most visible surrogates. Carson's position in the cabinet requires Senate confirmation before it becomes official.\n\nCarson, who grew up in inner-city Detroit, has often recounted his childhood experiences in his books and motivational speeches. In his 1996 autobiography \"Gifted Hands,\" Carson wrote about the humiliation he felt using food stamps to pay for bread and milk, and how he began to excel at school only after receiving a free pair of glasses that allowed him to see the lessons written on chalkboards.\n\nCarson has not confirmed whether his family ever lived in federally-funded housing or received Section 8 subsidies to help pay rent. As a political figure, he has criticized such public assistance programs for creating \"dependency\" on the government among low-income minorities. In a 2015 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Carson stated, \"I'm interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society.\"",
    " Title: Treasury Department Delays Employer Mandate of Obamacare for One Year\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Treasury Department announced on Tuesday that a key part of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, will be postponed for one year. The employer mandate, or the shared responsibility rules, will not require businesses to offer health coverage to their employees or face penalties until 2015.\n\nThe announcement came as a surprise, as the White House was building momentum for its public education campaign and trying to signal that the health insurance exchanges would start enrollment on time in October. The delay in the employer mandate is not expected to derail the enrollment process, but it may affect public perception and provide critics with ammunition to discuss the law's implementation.\n\nThe administration insists that the new health insurance exchanges or marketplaces will start enrollment on time this October. The employer mandate is not central to the coverage push, as most large businesses already offer health benefits. However, the delay could mean that fewer people will obtain coverage next year.\n\nRepublicans have used the announcement to renew calls for the law's repeal and replacement. Repeal is unlikely as long as President Barack Obama is in office, but some groups have renewed their calls for defunding the health law. The delay could also resonate in the 2014 House and Senate campaigns.\n\nOne immediate question people are asking is whether this is the only delay the Obama administration will announce or if it is the first in a series of delays, with the individual mandate being a prime target. The White House and allies have stated that the main elements of the law will be ready to go in October, and they emphasize that the employer mandate is a segment of the law, but not its core.\n\nThe individual mandate, which survived a Supreme Court challenge last year, is expected to face resistance if it is delayed. Insurance companies would likely object to the delay, as they need the individual mandate to provide costly new services to cover everyone, sick and healthy, as the law requires. The employer mandate penalty for businesses with more than 50 employees was $2,000 per employee, but that has been put on hold after a noisy outcry from business groups and commentary about the law's impact on businesses during the economic recovery. Business groups have stated that the rules and regulations about employee coverage are cumbersome. The Treasury, which is responsible for this piece of Obamacare, said it had agreed to go back to the drawing board on Tuesday.",
    " Title: House Impeachment Managers Deliver Articles to Senate, Demand for Witnesses\n\nArticle:\n\nOn January 15, 2020, the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump were delivered to the Senate by House Clerk Cheryl Johnson and House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving. The impeachment managers, led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, also included Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Sylvia Garcia, Val Demings, Zoe Lofgren, and Jason Crow.\n\nThe Senate's decision on witnesses has become a contentious issue in the impeachment trial. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler stated that if the Senate does not obtain the witnesses and documents the House impeachment managers want, it is participating in an \"unconstitutional and disgusting cover-up.\"\n\nThe demand for witnesses and documents from the Senate is a point of contention, with the House wanting the Senate to continue the investigative work that the House began. This demand is seen as inconsistent with the Senate's pace and approach to the impeachment trial.\n\nThe House has been in an awkward situation since the pace of its investigation diverged from the pace of its impeachment. Speaker Nancy Pelosi wanted to devote more time to impeaching Trump over Ukraine, but the investigation took longer, causing the impeachment to take precedence. The House secured some meaningful witnesses, but a more deliberate process would have allowed for a more thorough investigation.\n\nThe House failed to subpoena key witnesses such as John Bolton, whose testimony is now said to be central to the integrity of a Senate trial. The release of new, disturbing Lev Parnas documents has provided a boost to the Democrats, but the House impeached before receiving these documents. If Speaker Pelosi had not delayed transmitting the articles, the Senate trial could have ended before the release of the documents.\n\nThe documents raise questions that would be natural to answer in an impeachment inquiry, but the inquiry had already ended. The Senate's decision on witnesses will depend on the political dynamics of the contest between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe impeachment trial is taking place in the run-up to an election, and both parties are engaging in political maneuvering. The Senate Republicans' argument for not calling witnesses is that the broad outlines of Trump's conduct are already known, and the Senate only needs to decide if his conduct rises to the level of removal. However, if Republicans maintain Trump did not engage in any misconduct, it raises the question why key witnesses such as John Bolton should not testify.",
    " Title: Reagan Daughter Denounces Father's Racist Remarks in 1971 Tapes as \"Ugliness\"\n\nArticle:\n\nPatti Davis, the daughter of former President Ronald Reagan, has denounced her father's recently uncovered racist remarks in a Washington Post op-ed, describing the comments as \"ugliness\" but asking for forgiveness. The recording, released by the National Archives and published Tuesday by The Atlantic, features Reagan, then-governor of California, referring to United Nations delegates from African countries as \"monkeys.\"\n\nIn the op-ed published Thursday, Davis wrote, \"There is no defense, no rationalization, no suitable explanation for what my father said on that taped phone conversation.\" The recording, made in October 1971 during a private phone call with then-President Richard Nixon, includes Reagan venting about delegates who voted against the U.S. to have the United Nations recognize the People's Republic of China.\n\nDavis, in her op-ed, asked the public to forgive her late father for words \"that should never have been uttered in any conversation,\" but that these remarks were an \"aberration.\" She wrote, \"The words he used in his conversation with Nixon can not be interpreted as anything but ugliness.\"\n\nDavis also stated that she never heard her father make such remarks while growing up, and that bigotry and racism were addressed in her family by making it clear that these were toxic and sinister beliefs that should always be called out and shunned.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time the former Republican president has been criticized for racist remarks. During his 1966 campaign for governor in California, Reagan told a crowd of supporters that, \"If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house, it is his right to do so,\" according to Politico. Reagan also helped create the \"welfare queen\" stereotype, contributing to a narrative that black women abuse taxpayer dollars to support lazy and lavish lifestyles.\n\nHistorians have also cited \"racist policies\" Reagan implemented during his presidency that disproportionately harmed people of color, laying the groundwork for his \"War on Drugs.\"\n\nThe previously unheard audio recording has surfaced during President Donald Trump's relentless Twitter attacks on four minority progressive congresswomen and Baltimore Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings. Trump has often referenced Reagan during his presidency and even shares a slogan Reagan used during his 1980 campaign, 'Make America Great Again.' Trump has repeatedly defended his statements, including tweeting that he doesn't have \"a racist bone in his body.\" A July Quinnipiac poll found that 51% of Americans view Trump as a racist.",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Speech: A Shift in Tone and Emphasis, but Few Specifics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from his usual free-flowing speeches, Donald Trump delivered a carefully crafted foreign policy address on Wednesday, focusing on a more measured tone and avoiding some of his controversial proposals. Notably absent from the speech were explicit mentions of his proposed border wall with Mexico, nuclear weapons for South Korea and Japan, or withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nTrump did criticize the Iran nuclear deal, but stopped short of promising to tear it up or demand a renegotiation on day one. Instead, he reiterated his stance that Iran would not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, a position mirroring President Obama's before the controversial agreement with Teheran.\n\nThe speech included a harsh critique of Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, but Trump did not commit to unwavering support for Israel or outline specific plans to protect Middle Eastern Christians from ISIS genocide. He did, however, promise to swiftly destroy the Islamic State and did not repeat his claim that President Bush lied about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction to justify the Iraq War.\n\nTrump's call for an \"America first\" policy, a slogan associated with isolationists who opposed aiding allies during World War II, raised questions about his understanding of American law and foreign affairs. He also pledged to prevent American companies from moving abroad and to pressure allies to pay more for their defense, but did not detail how he would achieve these goals.\n\nCritics of President Obama's foreign policy may welcome Trump's call for a more robust military, a tougher stance against Islamic radicalism, and an America-centric policy. However, his speech contained few concrete remedies for restoring economic strength, a key factor in America's ability to project power abroad, according to Trump.\n\nOne of the most critical sections of the speech was Trump's assessment of Hillary Clinton's performance as Secretary of State, where he accused her of misleading the nation about the Benghazi attack and failing to respond effectively during the crisis. This, Trump suggested, demonstrated Clinton's inability to lead in a crisis, a theme likely to be a recurring one if Trump secures the nomination.",
    " Title: Sequester Debate Unchanged as Economy Shrinks Due to Defense Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent news of the economy shrinking towards the end of the year, attributed to a 22.2 percent drop in defense spending, has been viewed by some as a warning of potential economic consequences if larger automatic reductions, known as the sequester, take effect from March 1. However, this news is not expected to significantly alter the ongoing debate over the sequester.\n\nIf Congress fails to reach an agreement to prevent the sequester, the Defense Department would face a $500 billion cut, while $700 billion would be deducted from other domestic discretionary programs. Steve Bell, a veteran of Capitol Hill who worked on the Senate Budget Committee for 39 years, including much of that time as a top aide, stated that there is a sense of resignation among many members of Congress regarding the potential impact of the sequester.\n\nBell, who is now with the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., said in an interview that the pro-defense people have lost momentum, while the big deficit hawks have gained momentum. He added that a strong minority consensus is emerging, stating, \"Let the sequester occur. It's the only spending cuts we're ever going to get out of this entire mess from the last four years.\"\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center has warned that the threat of future cuts could cause companies to take preemptive measures, such as layoffs and other actions. Steve Bell stated, \"The sequester, and its impact on defense, we believe, will lead to furloughs of civilian defense workers. It will lead to either the sale or bankruptcy of very small subcontractors, things that are occurring right now in the Washington, D.C., area. People are selling their small businesses to larger defense contractors because they can't stay in business. And we think the net effect will probably be, conservatively, a million lost jobs just from the defense sequester alone.\"\n\nSen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, described Wednesday's news as a \"clamorous klaxon horn sounding danger.\" In a statement, he said, \"We must avoid sequestration because of the damage it would do to the economy, to important domestic investments, and to our national security. Today's GDP report demonstrates what is at stake economically. Top economists have warned us that sequestration could send us back into recession, and we should heed their warnings.\"\n\nDefense contractors, who have much at stake, also expressed concern. Marion Blakey, president of the Aerospace Industries Association, stated, \"It's what we have been warning about for months and months, because we do know that the cuts to defense spending that are already in place through the Budget Control Act are causing our companies to pull back, laying off workers. That's going on right now. It has real effects in terms of their ability to invest in R&D, to train. There are a variety of aspects that all have an economic impact. We know if a sequester goes into effect, we're going to see a much more dramatic acceleration of job losses.\"\n\nBlakey cited a study by George Mason University economists that forecast 2 million lost jobs in the first year of a sequester. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a former Congressional Budget Office director, and a favorite of Capitol Hill conservatives, does not disagree that the sequester is a bad idea. However, he thinks too much is being made of the fourth-quarter GDP data.\n\nHoltz-Eakin notes that the third quarter saw defense spending rise robustly, and he expects the Commerce Department number-crunchers to eventually revise upward the fourth-quarter data. In an interview, he said, \"It would be better not to have [the sequester] happen, but this is not why. You can make too much of today's GDP report pretty easily... if you ignore the weird timing and look between midyear and now, defense spending dropped at about a 6 percent annual rate. And that's what we expect to be happening.\"\n\nThe U.S. military withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the Pentagon following orders to downsize over 10 years, explain part of what we're seeing, Holtz-Eakin said. \"Is the sequester a good idea? No. It was supposed to be such a bad idea that we'd do something good. The fact that it was a bad idea originally has not changed. It's still a bad idea. It should not happen.\"\n\nHowever, Holtz-Eakin's comments have made defense contractors and many others nervous. He said, \"I do not think that if the 2013 sequester happened, it would be the end of the world. I think the economy could still grow.\" But he said the 10 years worth of sequester cuts to defense and domestic discretionary spending is the wrong strategy. It's more like the European-style austerity that has helped throw many of those nations into recession. The focus, according to Holtz-Eakin, should be on entitlement cuts.\n\nThe reason we got the sequester in the first place was due to the competing and partisan views of reality in Washington. Wednesday offered little relief on that front. White House spokesman Jay Carney blamed Republicans for letting matters get to the present stage. He said in his Wednesday briefing, \"Talk about letting the sequester kick in as though that were an acceptable thing belies where Republicans were on this issue not that long ago, and it makes clear again that this is sort of political brinksmanship of the kind that results in one primary victim, and that's American taxpayers, the American middle class.\"\n\nTo which House Republicans attempted to hold up a mirror to President Obama. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in a statement, \"The President's own policies are causing our economy to stall. The President's sequester is already hurting our military and our economy. It's time for the President to work with us to replace the sequester with common-sense spending cuts and entitlement reforms.\"",
    " Title: Obama Proposes One-Year Extension for Cancelled Health Insurance Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has proposed a one-year extension for health insurance policies that would otherwise be cancelled due to the Affordable Care Act. The proposal aims to alleviate the controversy surrounding the cancellation of individual insurance policies and the subsequent blame game between the administration and the health insurance industry.\n\nAt a press conference on Thursday, Obama stated, \"The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be cancelled into 2014.\" The announcement follows a series of public backlash and criticism over the cancellation of individual insurance policies due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIndustry CEOs have been summoned to a White House meeting on Friday, which is expected to be filled with discussions about the responsibilities and accountability of both parties involved. The proposal has been met with skepticism from health insurers, state insurance commissioners, and leading actuaries, who question the feasibility of the extension.\n\nHealth insurance plans have already set their prices for the Affordable Care Act plans based on a specific number of customers and the right mix of healthy and sick individuals. If they do not receive the expected number of customers, they warn that the mix will be disrupted, and prices will increase, potentially creating a new challenge for the administration.\n\nKaren Ignagni, president and CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, the leading health insurance trade group, stated, \"Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers.\"\n\nCori Uccello, the senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, added, \"Changing the [Affordable Care Act] provisions could alter the dynamics of the insurance market, creating two parallel markets operating under different rules, thereby threatening the viability of insurance markets operating under the new rules.\"\n\nThe proposal comes as a political solution to a policy problem, according to Bill Pierce, a former Department of Health and Human Services official who has also worked in the health insurance industry. Pierce, now a senior director at APCO Worldwide, stated, \"You can not solve a policy problem with a political solution.\"\n\nObama acknowledged the administration's role in the rollout issues of the health care law, stating, \"What we want to do is to be able to say to these folks, you know what, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan.\" However, the feasibility and implications of the proposed extension remain uncertain.",
    " Title: Protesters Gather at Baton Rouge Convenience Store Following Fatal Police Shooting of Alton Sterling\n\nArticle:\n\nA day after the fatal shooting of Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old man, by police in the parking lot of a convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, protesters gathered at the site. The incident, which occurred at around 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, has sparked widespread outrage and calls for transparency.\n\nThe scene was marked by concentric rings of protesters, with the outermost ring consisting of young men driving cars around the block, blaring \"Fuck the police.\" In the next ring, neighbors gathered, sharing stories and memories of Sterling, and in the center, a trio of devastated people stood near the store's entrance.\n\nTawandra Carr, a neighbor who had a playful relationship with Sterling, was the last person to speak to him before the incident. At about 12:30 a.m., Carr approached Sterling in the parking lot, and the two pretended to argue before breaking into laughter. Sterling seemed in a good mood, according to Carr, unaware that an anonymous caller had told police that Sterling had threatened him with a pistol, and officers were on their way.\n\nSterling had packed up his wares for the night, but Carr persuaded him to sell her a bootleg copy of the movie \"Central Intelligence\" for two dollars. Suddenly, two police cars arrived from opposite directions and pulled into the parking lot. Carr's account starts to coincide with a video made by a bystander at this point.\n\nThe video shows the officers tackling Sterling onto the hood of a car and then to the ground, where they pin him. In the midst of overlapping yelling and cursing, one of the officers cried out, \"He's got a gun!\" and both officers drew their weapons.\n\nAbdullah Muflahi, who owns the Triple S Food Mart and had always allowed Sterling to sell his music and movies in the parking lot, arrived shortly after the incident. He pulled out his phone and started recording. The officers were on top of Sterling, and there was a cluster of two or three shots. The police then rolled off, and Sterling lay with blood pooling on his chest.\n\nAn officer appeared to reach into Sterling's pocket and pull out what Muflahi said was a gun. Muflahi kept his phone video a secret, fearing that the police would confiscate it. In short order, they did, taking the security camera footage from his store as well.\n\nVeda Washington, Sterling's aunt, arrived later. She had helped raise Sterling and took him in when his mother died in 1992 when he was a teenager. When she arrived at the scene, she alternated between chanting \"Black lives matter\" and wailing in mourning for the nephew she regarded as a son.\n\nThe officers involved in the shooting, Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake, have been placed on paid administrative leave, as is standard practice for officers involved in shootings. Salamoni's father is a high-ranking member of the Baton Rouge police, and in 2009, before he became a police officer, Salamoni was charged with disturbing the peace, but the charge was dropped. The other officer, Lake, was involved in another shooting in 2014.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, announced that the state was handing over the investigation to federal authorities after calls for transparency from community leaders and Sterling's family. By Wednesday night, the mood among protesters at the Triple S was tense, with people expressing anger, disillusionment with the police, and fear. However, the mood quickly shifted as gospel music played, and people started to sing along. Veda Washington, Sterling's aunt, took the microphone and called for peace in their protests.",
    " Title: House Passes Comprehensive Legislation to Combat Prescription Drug Epidemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a comprehensive bill on Friday aimed at addressing the prescription drug epidemic, which has resulted in more overdose deaths in recent years than car accidents. The bill passed with a vote of 400-5, marking the last of 18 bipartisan pieces of legislation the House passed this week to address the drug crisis.\n\nThe abuse of opioids, synthetic painkillers, has become a significant issue in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 28,000 people died from overdoses from these drugs in 2014, and overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999.\n\nThe legislation aims to combat the crisis in several ways, including helping pregnant mothers who suffer from addiction, increasing access to naloxone (a drug that can reverse the effects of an overdose), and creating a task force of patients, medical officials, advocacy groups, and federal agencies to establish guidelines for prescribing pain medication.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated at a press conference, \"This has been a very big week in the House. Addiction divides families. Addiction tears communities apart. Addiction takes lives.\" He continued, \"This week, action was taken. It was a bipartisan action.\"\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan has made the issue a top priority, highlighting the legislation multiple times throughout the week. In a press conference with House leadership, he invited Reps. Susan Brooks of Indiana and Robert Dold of Illinois, both of whom sponsored opioid measures that passed this week, to discuss the personal impact of the epidemic.\n\nThe Senate passed comprehensive legislation in March, authorizing $725 million in grants for state and local governments to strengthen drug monitoring, improve addiction treatment, and expand prevention, education, and law enforcement efforts. The bill the House passed on Friday consolidates the different measures passed throughout the week into one comprehensive package.\n\nThe House and Senate are expected to create a conference committee to iron out the differences between their measures and send the legislation to President Obama, who is expected to sign it. However, issues of funding remain, with the White House proposing $1.1 billion in new funding to combat the addiction problem, but the current legislation calling for a lesser amount without providing the funding.\n\nDemocrats in both chambers of Congress attempted to pass amendments that would have provided $600 million in funding, but Republicans blocked both efforts and plan to address the issue in the regular appropriations process later this year. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the author of the Senate's opioid legislation, has been actively pushing the House to act more swiftly and in a comprehensive way on this issue. Portman expressed confidence that the House and Senate versions can be consolidated into a single comprehensive bill and sent to the president's desk soon.",
    " Title: Buttigieg Accused of Plagiarism in Speeches Reminiscent of Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is facing accusations of plagiarism after a series of tweets and speeches that appear to mimic the language and phrasing of former President Barack Obama.\n\nOver the weekend, Buttigieg tweeted a series of statements that drew comparisons to a tweet from Obama in 2012. Buttigieg wrote, \"If we can light up a high school gym\u2014we can light a neighborhood. If we can light up a neighborhood\u2014we can light a city. If we can light up a city\u2014we can light up our country.\"\n\nA number of Twitter users compared this to a tweet from Obama in 2012, where the president wrote, \"One voice can change a room. And if it can change a room, it can change a city. And if it can change a city, it can change a state.\"\n\nCo-host of \"The View\" Meghan McCain commented, \"Oh COME ON! I know Pete thinks he's the next Obama but this is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Buttigieg campaign told Fox News that the tweet was in reference to an event earlier on the campaign trail where the lights went out and attendees used their cellphones as lights.\n\nParkland survivor and conservative activist Kyle Kashuv accused Buttigieg of making a habit of mimicking Obama and further claimed the presidential candidate was plagiarizing while sharing a mash-up of similarities between Buttigieg and Obama's speeches. Kashuv tweeted a video made by The Recount with the message, \"So it turns out Pete Buttigieg is just blatantly plagiarizing Barack Obama. Cmon man at least come up [with] your own platitudes...\"\n\nLiberals also noticed a pattern, with another clip of Buttigieg using similar language to Obama being shared by a writer for Common Dreams, a publication that identifies as \"providing breaking news & views for the progressive community.\"\n\nThe Buttigieg campaign has not yet responded to requests for comment on the plagiarism allegations.",
    " Title: White House Prevents CDC Director from Testifying on School Reopening Amidst Ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director, Robert Redfield, from testifying before Congress regarding the reopening of schools amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, it was announced that Redfield would not be allowed to speak at the hearing for the House Committee on Education and Labor's Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education scheduled for July 23.\n\nHouse Education Committee Chairman Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) criticized the White House's decision, stating, \"It is alarming that the Trump administration is preventing the CDC from appearing before the Committee at a time when its expertise and guidance is so critical to the health and safety of students, parents, and educators.\"\n\nScott also condemned the White House's \"lack of transparency\" at such a critical point during the pandemic as \"difficult decisions\" are being made regarding schools. He added, \"This lack of transparency does a great disservice to the many communities across the country facing difficult decisions about reopening schools this fall.\"\n\nThe White House's decision comes amid ongoing deliberation about reopening schools in the fall. As more than 38 states are seeing increases in coronavirus cases, President Donald Trump has continued to demand schools reopen in the fall. When the CDC released its guidelines for safely reopening schools, the president took to Twitter, lambasting their recommendations and demanding revisions.\n\nHowever, Redfield made it clear that the CDC does not plan to revise its guidelines but instead plans to provide more information. In a tweet on July 8, Trump stated, \"I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!\"\n\nAs of Saturday morning, there are more than 3.7 million known coronavirus cases in the United States, with the death toll surpassing 142,000 and over 1.7 million reported recoveries.",
    " Title: White House Decision on Encryption Access for Tech Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has made a decision regarding access to encrypted data on technology products, which extends beyond merely cooperating with companies like Apple and Google in criminal and national security investigations. The administration has determined that it will not compel these companies to breach the security of their products.\n\nInvestigators will now have to rely on alternative methods to obtain data stored in the cloud in unencrypted form or transmitted over phone lines, as these are covered by a law affecting telecommunications providers but not technology giants.\n\nLast year, FBI Director James Comey expressed concern after Apple introduced an operating system that encrypted nearly all data contained in an iPhone. The system was designed to ensure that Apple did not retain the keys, giving users control through the codes or fingerprints they use to access their phones. As a result, Apple, upon receiving a court order for data, could not access the encrypted information.\n\nComparing the system to a door law enforcement could not enter or a car trunk they could not unlock, Comey's concern about the so-called \"going dark\" problem received support from the director of the National Security Agency and other intelligence officials.\n\nAfter a year of study and extensive White House debate, President Obama and his advisers have reached a broad conclusion that an effort to compel companies to give the government access would fail, both politically and technologically.\n\nPeter G. Neumann, one of the nation's leading computer scientists and a co-author of a paper that examined the government's proposal for special access, stated, \"This looks promising, but there's still going to be tremendous pressure from law enforcement. The N.S.A. is capable of dealing with the cryptography for now, but law enforcement is going to have real difficulty with this. This is never a done deal.\"",
    " Title: Incumbents Struggle as Ebola, ISIS, and Stock Market Volatility Dominate Election Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final stretch before the November 4th election is proving to be a challenging one for incumbents, as domestic and overseas crises dominate the political landscape. President Barack Obama was forced to cancel several campaign appearances this week to oversee the Ebola response, highlighting the growing troubles that are upending plans for the final stretch before the election.\n\nThe current election cycle is particularly acute, with challenges ranging from the Ebola virus to ISIS jihadists to a volatile stock market. Instead of highlighting their accomplishments to constituents, incumbents are on defense.\n\nJulian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton University, noted that \"October 2014 is starting to remind me of October 2006, which in my professional time was the worst cycle for Republicans, and the best for Democrats.\" In 2006, Bush's Republicans, like Obama's Democrats, could not catch a break. Powerless in the face of the sectarian explosion engulfing Iraq and scarred by Hurricane Katrina, Bush limped into the elections and Democrats marched off with the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nToday, Democrats in tough elections do not want to be seen with Obama, and Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes has refused to say if she voted for the president. The gloomy October is making it easier for Republicans to press their case against Obama and incumbent Democrats.\n\nRepublican candidates are seizing on the Ebola crisis, with GOP Rep. Cory Gardner demanding action amid Republican calls for a travel ban covering the epicenter of Ebola in West Africa. In a Colorado Senate debate on Wednesday, Gardner said, \"If the president is not willing to put into a place a travel ban, then we should have 100 percent screening of the people who are coming from those affected areas.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Udall, trailing Gardner in the Rocky Mountain state, hit back by accusing his opponent of complicity in budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPotential Republican 2016 challengers are also pitching in, despite Obama's assurances that the chances of catching Ebola are \"extraordinarily\" low. Senator Rand Paul said in an interview with CNN Thursday, \"If someone has Ebola at a cocktail party, they're contagious and you can catch it from them.\"\n\nThe multiple crises have also played into a critique that the president is too passive and reacts to, rather than dictates, events. Few charges are as damaging for a president as the sense he has lost control, and the cascade of dramas over the last six weeks or so has often left the White House struggling to catch up.\n\nThere is also trouble for the White House abroad in the run-up to the mid-terms, and Republicans also see an opening against Obama and incumbent Democrats in the fight against ISIS. In one spot, New Hampshire senatorial candidate Scott Brown warned, \"Radical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country. President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat. Not me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, stock market losses complicate Democratic attempts to highlight what good economic news there is out there\u2014including increasingly robust jobs growth and a dip in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, the lowest level in six years.\n\nDespite being in the box seat in most Senate races, Republicans are hardly basking in popularity\u2014a fact encouraging to Democrats as 2016 looms. The Republican brand is also battered, following gridlock in Congress and a government shutdown last year, and the unfinished tussle between the establishment and the Tea Party.\n\n\"The story of the Republican Party under Obama, no matter how many problems the president faces, is that they have consistently managed to shoot themselves in the foot,\" said Zelizer, who is also a CNN contributor.",
    " Title: House Approves School Security Measures, No Action on Gun Control\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has approved a bill to allocate more funds for metal detectors, locks, and other school security measures, but has taken no steps towards tightening gun control laws, one month after a shooting at a Florida high school that resulted in the deaths of 17 individuals.\n\nOn Wednesday, lawmakers voted 407-10 in favor of legislation to allocate between $50 million to $75 million annually from 2019 through 2028 for school security and safety training. No parallel measure is currently pending in the Senate, where a more ambitious bill is being debated.\n\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, stated that the bill, on its own, is not sufficient to address the issue of gun violence. He called for a serious effort to pass legislation that expands background checks and bans military-style assault weapons.\n\nThe House bill does not allow any of the funding to be used for arming teachers or other school personnel. The White House has stated that the bill would be improved by lifting this restriction.\n\nSince the Parkland massacre, student protesters have successfully lobbied for tighter gun controls in Florida. Hundreds of them gathered outside the Capitol to urge Congress to take action on placing new limits on firearms and gun sales.\n\nIn the Senate, a bill to strengthen existing background checks of gun purchasers is being debated and enjoys broad bipartisan support, but has not been scheduled for debate. Congressional aides report that discussions are underway about folding the school safety and background check bills into a government funding bill that lawmakers aim to pass by March 23.\n\nEleven organizations, including some gun control and law enforcement groups, have written to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, urging the passage of the background checks bill this month.\n\nSince the Florida shooting, the Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration have considered measures to curb gun violence while trying to avoid crossing the powerful National Rifle Association lobby group or threatening the right to bear arms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. Neither the House nor Senate bills address many of the gun control initiatives backed by students, teachers, and families of shooting victims at the Florida school.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Katherine Posada, a teacher at the school, recounted the horror she experienced the day of the shooting and urged Congress to ban assault-style weapons like the AR-15 rifle used by Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the murders.\n\n\"Some of the victims were shot through doors, or even through walls \u2013 a knife can\u2019t do that,\" Posada said. \"How many innocent lives could have been saved if these weapons of war weren\u2019t so readily available?\"",

The women, whose disappearances generated significant attention in local media over the past decade, were discovered after Berry's frantic cries for help brought a neighbor to the door.\n\nAmanda Berry disappeared at age 16 on April 21, 2003, when she called her sister to say she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King. About a year later, Gina DeJesus vanished at age 14 on her way home from school. Police said Knight disappeared in 2002 and is 32 now. The three women were found inside a home where the shades were always drawn, and no one in the neighborhood seemed to have suspected that kidnapping victims might be inside.\n\nThree brothers in their 50s have been arrested in relation to the women's disappearances. They are 52-year-old Ariel Castro, 54-year-old Pedro Castro, and 50-year-old Onil Castro. As of midday Tuesday, authorities had not released any details about what they found inside the home or exactly what they've learned from the three women.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the women are being treated at a Cleveland area hospital, where they're reported to be in fair condition. The three suspects are expected to be charged within the next 36 hours.\n\nNeighbors have provided accounts of the women's discovery and the man who they would see coming and going from the home. Charles Ramsey, a neighbor, reported hearing screaming and seeing a young woman trying to escape from the house. Ramsey helped Berry escape by kicking and breaking the bottom of a door, allowing her to crawl out. Police arrested Ariel Castro at a nearby McDonald's restaurant and brought the other two women out of the house, witnesses said.\n\nA young child also emerged from the home, according to local news reports. As for Ariel Castro, the man who lived in the home, neighbors reported seeing him parking his red pickup truck behind his house, locking the gate, and entering through a back door. The house was often dark, with shades blocking the windows.\n\nAs this story develops, more details are expected to emerge. The three women are being treated at a Cleveland area hospital, and the three suspects are in custody and expected to be charged within the next 36 hours.",
    " Title: President Obama to Highlight Progress in Veterans Affairs, but Critics Point to Ongoing Scandals and Mismanagement\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Veterans Day, President Barack Obama will lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery and discuss his administration's progress in caring for veterans. However, critics of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) argue that little has changed, citing fresh scandals and persistent mismanagement.\n\nAccording to White House officials, Mr. Obama will emphasize progress in five areas for veterans, including reducing the backlog of benefits claims, increasing access to health care services, and decreasing homelessness among veterans. In conjunction with Mr. Obama's announcements, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe is set to declare that his state is the first to eliminate veterans' homelessness statewide.\n\nThe President will also call on Congress to act on three pieces of legislation to expand education benefits for veterans. However, problems within the VA continue unabated. An internal VA audit has found that secret waitlists occurred not only in Phoenix but at 110 VA facilities.\n\nVA officials have yet to correct a computer system error that led to tens of thousands of combat veterans being denied VA health care enrollment, despite the problem being brought to light in August. The administration has tried, under VA Secretary Robert McDonald, to move beyond the crisis that erupted in Phoenix in April 2014 over delayed health care for veterans and phony waitlists, which led to the resignation of former Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. The agency claims it has handled about 7 million more health care appointments for veterans in the past 12 months than in the previous year.\n\n\"Because of many of the reforms that Secretary McDonald has put into place, we have seen important progress made at the VA when it comes to ensuring that our veterans have access to the health care and benefits that they deserve,\" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nNearly 18 months after the waitlist scandal broke in Phoenix, the problems there are not resolved. An inspector general's report in October found that seven more Phoenix-area veterans died after delayed treatment and lapses in medical care.\n\nMr. McDonald also acknowledged during a House hearing last month that his department is suffering \"a leadership crisis.\" In September, for example, one of his top deputies quit under pressure from congressional investigators looking into a scandal over padding the salaries and relocation expenses of senior VA managers. Five VA officials invoked their Fifth Amendment rights at a House Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing last week in connection with the probe.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, said the VA is still suffering from a culture that fails to hold wrongdoing accountable.\n\n\"Until the VA rids itself of those who engage in scandalous behavior, the department will always be mired in scandal,\" Mr. Miller wrote in an op-ed in The Hill Tuesday. \"But unfortunately, indefensible civil service rules that put the job security of failing VA bureaucrats ahead of the safety of the veterans they are charged with serving are prolonging the agency's problems indefinitely.\"\n\nPete Hegseth, president of Concerned Veterans for America, says the VA under Mr. McDonald \"is not fundamentally serious about fixing the systematic problems plaguing the department.\"\n\nGovernment watchdogs in the past year have found numerous additional cases of VA whistleblowers facing retaliation, and of VA leadership failing to discipline those responsible for mismanagement or dangerous health care practices. The Office of Special Counsel wrote directly to Mr. Obama on Sept. 17 about continued problems at the Phoenix VA Medical Center, including the lack of training of emergency room nurses and substandard care at other facilities.\n\nOSC head Carolyn Lerner told the president that the lack of accountability for the problems in Phoenix \"sends the wrong message to the veterans served by this facility, including those who received substandard emergency care.\" Meanwhile, she said, the VA continues to go after employee whistleblowers with a vengeance.\n\n\"The VA has attempted to fire or suspend whistleblowers for minor indiscretions and, often, for activity directly related to the employee's whistleblowing,\" she told Mr. Obama. In a speech last week at the National Press Club, Mr. McDonald claimed that the VA has \"proposed disciplinary action against 300 individuals for manipulating scheduling.\"\n\n\"I just wish that there would be more fact-checking on some of the numbers that are used, because there are a lot of myths out there,\" he added. However, his claim is dubious. The VA's own statistics submitted to Congress showed that, as of last week, there were proposed disciplinary actions against 27 employees and one senior executive specifically for patient wait-time manipulation. Of those 27, three have been fired. Sharon Helman, the Phoenix VA medical center director, was fired for accepting improper gifts, not because of her role in the waitlist scandal. The department has proposed disciplinary action against 305 employees for various issues, including 20 probationary workers and other nonmedical employees such as food service workers and transportation supervisors. Funding for the VA has increased 73 percent since 2009, but examples of waste at the agency are rampant. Construction of a VA hospital in Denver is more than $1 billion over budget. An investigation earlier this year uncovered that a VA executive received almost $300,000 in relocation expenses to move from Washington to Philadelphia.",
    " Title: Public Opinion on Interpretation of U.S. Constitution Divided Along Party, Age, and Demographic Lines\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Senate debate over Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court has highlighted deep partisan and ideological divisions in Congress and the public regarding how the high court should interpret the Constitution.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in October, about half of the public (46%) believes the U.S. Supreme Court should make its rulings based on the Constitution's original meaning, while an identical share (46%) prefers decisions to be based on the Constitution's current meaning. This divide has remained relatively stable in recent years.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats hold starkly different views on this issue. Approximately 74% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor decisions based on the Constitution's original meaning, while 23% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents hold the same view. This gap is slightly wider than it was in February 2014, when 68% of Republicans and Republican leaners and 27% of Democrats and Democratic leaners favored the originalist approach.\n\nThere are significant differences in these views by age, race and ethnicity, education, and religious affiliation.\n\nAdults younger than 30 favor decisions based on the Constitution's current meaning by about a two-to-one margin (63% to 31%), while those ages 30 to 49 are more divided (44% original meaning, 45% current meaning). A 54% majority of those 50 and older prefer decisions based on the Constitution's original meaning.\n\nRacial and ethnic differences also emerge, with blacks (63%) more likely than whites (41%) to favor decisions based on the Constitution's current meaning. Adults with at least a college degree, particularly those with postgraduate degrees, are more likely than those with less education to favor decisions based on the Constitution's current meaning.\n\nWhite evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly favor decisions based on the Constitution's original meaning (79%), while the religiously unaffiliated are more likely to favor decisions based on the Constitution's current meaning (64%).",
    " Title: New CNN/ORC Poll Shows Mixed Reviews for President-elect Donald Trump's Transition and Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo weeks after the 2016 presidential election, a new CNN/ORC Poll reveals a divided American public regarding President-elect Donald Trump's performance during the transition and expectations for his presidency.\n\nA majority (53%) of Americans believe Trump will do a good job as president, while 40% approve of his ability to handle the economy, a figure that surpasses the confidence levels for former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan before their first inaugurations.\n\nThe poll indicates that Americans anticipate Trump will achieve several of his campaign promises, with 75% expecting him to repeal and replace Obamacare, 68% believing he will renegotiate NAFTA, and 60% predicting he will create good-paying jobs in economically challenged areas.\n\nHowever, opinions are more divided on other issues such as \"draining the swamp\" (51%), defeating ISIS (50%), and building a wall along the border with Mexico (48%).\n\nOverall, 66% of Americans believe a Trump presidency will bring change to the country, but only 43% expect it to be change for the better, a significant drop compared to the 63% who thought Obama would bring change for the better in November 2008.\n\nTrump's favorability ratings have risen post-election to 47% favorable and 50% unfavorable, with these ratings outpacing the previous high reached just after the Republican National Convention in July (43% favorable).\n\nRegarding Trump's transition, 46% approve of his handling, while 45% disapprove. These marks are lower than approval ratings for Obama, Bush, or Clinton during their transitions to the presidency.\n\nOn one point of concern, few say Trump's efforts have gone far enough to assuage their worries about potential conflicts of interest. About 60% say the arrangement Trump has proposed for handling his business while serving as president\u2014to have his adult children run the Trump Organization\u2014does not go far enough to prevent conflicts.\n\nThe poll suggests that Trump is shaping up to be one of the most polarizing presidents-elect in recent years. While there is relatively high confidence in his ability to deal with the economy, there is also an outsized lack of confidence and a diminished middle ground.\n\nOn handling foreign affairs, confidence in Trump is sharply downside-up, yet still, few land in the middle. Almost half (49%) say they have no real confidence, while 27% say they have a lot of faith in the president-elect. Just 23% say they have \"some confidence.\"\n\nOverall, Trump ranks toward the middle of the pack on providing leadership and making appointments, but his no-confidence numbers far outpace those for his predecessors. On providing real leadership, 33% have deep confidence, but 43% say they have no confidence. And thinking about appointing the best people to office, 32% say they have a lot of confidence in Trump, yet 45% say they have no confidence in him to choose appointees.\n\nThese numbers could shift as Trump fills out his cabinet and staff; polling measuring confidence in previous presidents-elect was conducted closer to their inauguration after many critical appointments had been made.\n\nSeveral demographic divides that emerged during the campaign appear to persist post-election. Women are less likely to see Trump as a good president than men, and residents of rural areas are more than twice as likely as urbanites to think Trump will do a good job. Among those in union households, a typically Democratic constituency where Trump had stronger appeal than most Republicans, 53% expect Trump to do a good job as president.\n\nOverall, the share saying things in the US are going well today has dipped from its late-October high, with 47% saying things are going well, down from 54% then. That shift is mostly partisan. While there has been an uptick in the share of Republicans who think things are going well (from 21% to 32%), the share of Democrats who say the same has dropped about twenty points (85% to 66%).\n\nAbout half of Americans overall say that four years from now, they expect the country to be better off than it is today, 46% say it'll be worse off, and just 3% say it'll be the same. That's worse than impressions of how the country would be after four years of Obama, but a little better than assessments of how it'd be doing four years into George W. Bush's presidency.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Criticism of Clinton's Campaign Success and Disputes Soft Foreign Policy Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday defended his criticism that Hillary Clinton's campaign success is largely based on her being a female candidate and dismissed assertions about him having a soft foreign policy.\n\nDuring an interview on \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday,\" Trump stated, \"The only card she has is the woman card.\" He further added, \"Even women don't like her. If she were not a woman, she would not even be in this race.\"\n\nTrump's comments come after his sweep in five Northeast primary contests on Tuesday, where he said, \"The only card she has is the woman's card. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.\"\n\nIn response to criticism that his foreign policy speech last week sounded like a liberal Democrat's, Trump argued, \"We need to knock off ISIS and get out of there.\" He continued to argue that overthrowing dictators has been a failed foreign policy strategy that has led to instability in the Middle East.\n\n\"Every move we've made in the Middle East has been wrong,\" Trump said, arguing that other countries should pay more to protect the world and that more taxpayer money must go to U.S. infrastructure.\n\n\"We can't have this anymore,\" Trump said. \"We are spending all of our money in the Middle East. We need to strengthen our military and pull back... In the meantime, our country is becoming Third World.\" Trump also stated, \"I will be tougher than Clinton.\"\n\nGOP primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told ABC's \"This Week\" that Trump's policy speech \"reflects a weak and naive approach to foreign policy.\"\n\nTrump also argued that his attacks on Clinton are no worse than those of her primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has questioned Clinton's qualifications.\n\nWhile both Clinton and Trump's favorability ratings among women are low, Trump's are worse, especially among female general election voters. However, Trump argued Sunday that his numbers will improve if and when he faces Clinton in the general election.\n\n\"Once I start on Hillary, the numbers will change,\" he said. \"Watch what happens with Hillary. Watch what happens with her numbers.\"",
    " Title: House Democrats Introduce Resolution to Block President Trump's National Emergency Declaration, Setting Up Potential First Veto\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats have initiated a move to counter President Trump's national emergency declaration along the U.S.-Mexico border by introducing a resolution to block the decree, potentially leading to the president's first veto. The resolution, proposed by Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), enjoys significant support from fellow majority Democrats in the House. As of Friday morning, Castro announced that the measure had 222 cosponsors, including Republican Rep. Justin Amash.\n\nIn a press call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Castro's resolution was described as a response to what Pelosi called the \"FakeTrumpEmergency\" and the border wall the president is seeking to fund. The level of support for the resolution all but guarantees its passage in the House. However, there is a possibility that the Republican-controlled Senate could also follow suit, potentially revealing a significant divide within the party over the president's decision.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has already expressed support for such a measure, and several other Republicans have voiced concern over the president's declaration. This scenario could see the resolution clearing the Senate, leading to a striking fissure in the party over the president's decision, and likely prompting Trump to issue his first veto.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues, Pelosi stated, \"We have a solemn responsibility to uphold the Constitution, and defend our system of checks and balances against the President's assault.\" She argued that the president's decision to bypass the constitutional legislative process to secure funding for the border wall violates the Constitution and must be terminated.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, maintains that the wall is necessary to protect the country from illegal immigration, crime, and drugs. He has highlighted construction already underway and pledged to continue with more as he braces for both a congressional and legal battle. In response to a lawsuit launched earlier this week by more than a dozen Democrat-led states, he criticized \"Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left.\"\n\nThe brief resolution filed Friday simply states, \"The national emergency declaration is hereby terminated.\" The House passed the measure during a short pro forma session, with Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) presiding over an almost empty chamber. Pelosi has promised that the House will \"move swiftly\" to pass the measure, predicting that the resolution will be referred to the Senate and then sent to the President's desk.\n\nTrump declared the emergency last Friday, a decision tied to his signing of a government spending package that averted a second shutdown. While that package included $1.4 billion for 55 miles of border barrier \u2013 significantly less than Trump sought \u2013 Trump aims to use the emergency declaration and other tools to secure billions more. The money would be transferred from a federal asset forfeiture fund, Defense Department anti-drug efforts, and a military construction fund. Federal officials have yet to identify which projects would be affected.",
    " Title: Obama Endorses Justin Trudeau for Canadian Election Amid Blackface Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for re-election on Wednesday, offering him support amidst the recent controversy over Trudeau's use of blackface. The endorsement comes as Trudeau seeks to remain in office following next week's elections, but his campaign has been impacted by the release of photos and videos showing Trudeau with his face painted black or brown for various costumes.\n\nTrudeau apologized for his actions, but admitted he could not confirm that those were the only instances he had worn blackface. In a tweet, Obama expressed his support for Trudeau, stating, \"I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.\"\n\nObama and Trudeau have been friends since Trudeau was elected in 2015, and their friendship has continued even after Obama left office in 2017. The endorsement, however, highlights a contrast with Obama's handling of U.S. presidential primaries, in which he has not publicly endorsed any candidate, not even his former vice president, Joe Biden.\n\nSome Canadians have expressed discomfort with Obama's endorsement as a form of foreign election interference. Drew Fagan, a professor of public policy at the Munk School of Global Affairs, described it as \"unusual.\" However, there is no evidence of actual interference at this time.\n\nElections Canada spokeswoman Natasha Gauthier told the BBC that determining foreign influence would require an examination of expenses, the parties incurring them, and their reasons. Obama has endorsed foreign leaders in the past, such as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",
    " Title: Senate Adopts Amended 'Gang of Eight' Immigration Framework\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has adopted the amended 'Gang of Eight' immigration framework, a bipartisan proposal aimed at overhauling the nation's immigration system. The vote, which took place on Monday, resulted in a 68-32 majority, falling short of the symbolically significant 70-vote threshold that some had anticipated.\n\nThe legislation required 51 votes to pass, and it significantly outperformed that minimum. Fourteen members of the Republican conference crossed party lines to support the bill, while every 'no' vote was cast by a Republican. The Senate's debate focused primarily on the Republican party, with Senators sitting at their desks and voting one by one as the roll was called. Vice President Biden presided over the chamber, admonishing the gallery against overt expressions of approval or disapproval.\n\nThe House of Representatives is now set to consider the bill, but House Speaker John Boehner has already stated his intention to disregard the Senate-passed bill. The House saga may not begin for some time, and even Senator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's main proponents, has signaled support for the creation and passage of a distinct House bill.\n\nRepublican 'ayes' in the Senate vote included Alexander (TN), Ayotte (NH), Chisea (NJ), Collins (ME), Corker (TN), Flake (AZ), Graham (SC), Hatch (UT), Heller (NV), Hoeven (ND), Kirk (IL), McCain (AZ), Rubio (FL), Murkowski (AK).\n\nHouse Deputy Whip, Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL), has described passing the Senate bill as a \"pipe dream\" in his chamber. House Speaker John Boehner has emphasized the need for immigration reform to be grounded in \"real border security.\" The immigration reform discussion now shifts to the House of Representatives.",
    " Title: Congress Approves Fiscal Crisis Package with Special-Interest Tax Breaks, Worth $76 Billion\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress has approved a last-minute deal aimed at preventing middle-class tax hikes, which includes over 50 temporary tax breaks for various industries, totaling approximately $76 billion. The tax breaks, extended for another year through the fiscal crisis package, have been criticized by lawmakers for including special-interest favors such as tax breaks for Hollywood, Puerto Rico rum producers, and the alternative energy industry.\n\nThe tax breaks include:\n\n1. A rule allowing TV and film producers to write off the first $15 million in production costs inside the U.S., valued at $248 million over 10 years.\n2. A provision allowing motorsport race tracks to more quickly write off improvement costs, valued at $78 million.\n3. A 50% tax credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance through 2013, worth $331 million.\n4. Increased tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, worth $222 million over 10 years.\n5. A tax credit of up to $2,500 for buying electric-powered vehicles, expanded to include electric-powered motorcycles, at a cost of $7 million.\n6. A tax credit for the production of wind, solar, and other renewable energy, at a cost of $12.2 billion.\n\nThe biggest of the tax breaks is a research and development tax credit, which helps U.S. manufacturers compete against foreign competition, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. Another provision helps restaurants and retailers expand by allowing them to more quickly write off the costs, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nWhile each industry defends their tax treatment as vital, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) stated that the inclusion of these tax breaks in the package feeds \"cynicism.\" McCain described the process as \"crammed into the bill literally in the middle of the night.\" He added, \"The American people deserve better and we have now earned their well-deserved disdain about the way we do business.\"",
    " Title: Release of Republican Memo Alleging FBI and DOJ Abuse in Russia Probe Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, on Saturday, claimed that the release of a previously classified Republican memo, which alleges bias by the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) during the 2016 presidential campaign, vindicates him in the ongoing Russia probe. Trump's tweet read, \"This memo totally vindicates \u2018Trump\u2019 in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. There was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) released the memo on Friday, alleging that officials at the FBI and DOJ used bias against Trump's campaign, ultimately leading to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate charges of collusion between aides working for then-candidate Trump and Russian officials.\n\nTrump approved the memo's release on Friday and said its revelations were a \"disgrace,\" adding, \"A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nReaction among lawmakers was divided. Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), also on the House Intelligence Committee, called for public hearings about the FBI and Justice Department actions that led to FISA warrants allowing the surveillance of former Trump adviser Carter Page.\n\nHowever, fellow Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona blasted the memo's release, saying it served \"no American interests\" to make the information public.\n\nDemocrats were mainly in unison in their condemnation of the Nunes memo, including House Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Adam Schiff of California who said it was \"deeply misleading and factually inaccurate.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also criticized the memo, releasing a statement on Friday calling it a \"desperate attempt to distract the American people from the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal.\"\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee are pushing to release their own memo and, in a statement on Friday, said the Nunes document failed to provide \"vital context.\" Trump said Friday he \"would be inclined\" to allow a Democratic rebuttal if it passed a \"security and legal review,\" according to a White House statement.\n\nDemocrats contend the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine the Mueller criminal probe that was launched in May 2017 as an outgrowth of an earlier FBI investigation.\n\nJerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Trump's decision to allow the release of the memo was \"part of a coordinated propaganda effort to discredit, disable and defeat the Russia investigation.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Nadler circulated a memo to House Democrats disputing the conclusions of the Nunes memo and arguing that Page was a lawful target of surveillance. \"Carter Page was, more likely than not, an agent of a foreign power. The Department of Justice thought so. A federal judge agreed,\" Nadler wrote in the memo.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown: Uncertainty Surrounds Duration and Resolution\n\nArticle:\n\nAs of the current writing, there are no ongoing negotiations regarding the federal government shutdown, which marks the first such event in 17 years. The Democratic-controlled Senate rejected a House bill on Tuesday morning that called for a House-Senate conference to resolve the disagreement. Senate Democrats rejected the House request due to Republican efforts to tie continued government funding to attempts to restrict the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Sen. Harry Reid, argue they are not opposed to revising Obamacare but are unwilling to do so under the threat of a government shutdown or debt default. \"No matter how many times they try to extort the American people and the Democrats here in the Senate, we're not going to re-litigate the health care issue,\" Sen. Reid said on the Senate floor. \"We're not going to do that. If they have problems with [Obamacare], we'll be happy to sit down and talk with them about a reasonable approach to do that, but we're not going to with a gun to the heads of the American people.\"\n\nSpeaker John Boehner and his House Republican conference have yet to offer a clear path out of the current crisis. Boehner stated in the House, \"Our country has big problems. Today our government has big problems.\" The duration of the shutdown remains uncertain, with predictions from Stan Collender, a partner at communications firm Qorvis and a former senior Capitol Hill aide, suggesting the shutdown could last at least a week.\n\nDemocrats, for the time being, appear to have a unified front, which tends to provide more leverage in politics. In contrast, some Republicans have expressed doubts about the House GOP strategy. If Democrats maintain their position that negotiations will not begin until the House passes the Senate's \"clean\" spending bill and reopens the government, Speaker Boehner would need to compromise, relying on some of his Republicans and House Democrats to pass the spending bill. This could potentially lead to another House GOP revolt against his leadership.\n\nDemocrats also seem to have the advantage of public opinion, according to a new Quinnipiac poll, which found far more people opposing an Obamacare-induced government shutdown than favoring it\u201472 percent to 22 percent. Republicans may struggle to blame the shutdown on Democrats due to decades of anti-government rhetoric. Even now, with the shutdown newly in effect, the Republican message that Democrats are to blame is being muddied by GOP rhetoric.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Race Intensifies as Labor Day Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the summer comes to an end, the race for the 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential nomination is set to intensify, with former Vice President Joe Biden's lead facing increased pressure. Biden, 76, has maintained a comfortable lead over his competitors, but his campaign has been marked by doubts over his age, fitness for office, and his ability to represent a party that has grown increasingly liberal.\n\nThe Democratic field, lacking a clear consensus candidate, is fractured along ideological and generational lines. While Biden enjoys widespread name recognition due to his eight years as Barack Obama's vice president and a long Senate career before that, he may suffer as voters focus on other candidates. This could open the door for his closest competitors, U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, or another rival, to gain momentum.\n\nDemocratic operative Joel Payne, who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, described Biden as the weakest front-runner in a contested primary in a long time, attributing his standing largely to voters' familiarity with him rather than his performance on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Democratic field has shrunk slightly in the past month, with U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand dropping out last week. However, 20 contenders continue to vie for the nomination. Ten Democrats will square off on Sept. 12 at a debate in Houston.\n\nDelacey Skinner, a Democratic strategist, noted that most people don't know many of the candidates. Jeff Link, a longtime Democratic strategist in Iowa, likened the primary-season campaign to an American football game, with Labor Day marking the start of the second half.\n\nBiden has faced criticism for his gaffes and episodes of faulty memory, sparking concerns over his age and his capacity to challenge Trump if he is the party's nominee. Biden is also viewed skeptically by some Democrats who see him as an out-of-touch moderate in a party moving leftward.\n\nBeyond Biden, the story of the contest's first few months has been the rise of Elizabeth Warren, whose relentless campaign schedule and formidable state-level organization have made her a serious threat to win the nomination. She has particularly emerged as a rival to Biden in Iowa, a state he needs to win to reinforce his argument that he is the candidate best equipped to take down Trump.\n\nHowever, questions persist about Warren's ambitious liberal agenda and her ability to attract moderate and black voters, as Biden does. Skinner believes Warren can expand her appeal beyond siphoning liberal voters from Sanders and other candidates on the left.\n\nAll top-tier contenders have faced questions about their ability to unite a deeply divided party and ultimately defeat Trump. Sanders, a self-described \"Democratic socialist,\" has seen his support slide compared to his 2016 presidential bid. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris had a seemingly breakout moment in the first Democratic debate in June but has since fallen back in the polls.\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, drew attention early in his campaign, but concerns persist about his lack of national experience and his handling of race relations and policing in his city.\n\nJoe Zepecki, a Democratic strategist in the general election battleground state of Wisconsin, noted that flawed candidates are common at this stage of the campaign, and eventually, the party will coalesce behind a nominee.\n\nWhile this may be true, the enduring questions surrounding Biden's age and fitness for office may mean Democrats will lack the \"safe\" choice they have had in the past, whether the candidate has been Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, or Clinton in 2008 and 2016.\n\nIowa's Link said the 2020 race remains fluid, and even lower-tier contenders such as U.S. Senator Cory Booker or former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke could still make a charge. The objective for candidates at this stage, Link said, is to \"organize, organize, organize - and get hot at the end.\"",
    " Title: The Weekly Standard Ceases Publication: A Tribute to a Writer's Magazine\n\nArticle:\n\nThe conservative political and cultural magazine, The Weekly Standard, announced its closure today, marking the end of a publication that has been a hub for conservative political opinion writing, clear-eyed political journalism, and a unique blend of cultural criticism for over two decades.\n\nFounded in the mid-1990s, The Weekly Standard was more than just a platform for conservative political discourse. It was a writer's magazine, defined by the distinct intelligences of the extraordinary people in its orbit. The magazine was known for its blend of gloriously middlebrow cultural criticism, unabashed idealism about America, seasoned realism about politics, and a sharp yet always sympathetic disdain for the ridiculous humanity of the elite institutions' inhabitants.\n\nThe magazine's personality was, in many ways, embodied by its longtime editor in chief, Bill Kristol. Known for his political philosophy and his ability to quote the great romantic poets on a dime, Kristol was deeply immersed in the minutia of the political moment, open to crazy ideas, always speaking half in jest, and somehow friends with practically everyone.\n\nThe Standard's strength lay in its ability to bring in great writers and let them be great. From the elitist anti-elitism of David Brooks' cultural writing in its early days to the sharp young-fogey heterodoxy of Matt Continetti's political writing in its middle age, the magazine was an incredible incubator of great writing.\n\nThe magazine's in-house writers, such as Christopher Caldwell, John Podhoretz, Matt Labash, Jon Last, Andy Ferguson, and many others, have defined the magazine's tone and made it special. The Standard was also a good venue for outside writers, spotting talent and providing a platform for their work.\n\nThe magazine's back-of-the-book section, dedicated to books, culture, faith, philosophy, and technology, was particularly noteworthy. This section showcased long, discursive essays on old books and new ideas, on faith and philosophy, on culture and technology. The Standard understood that politics is downstream of culture, and its back-of-the-book section reflected this understanding.\n\nThe Weekly Standard was a nursery of genius, as Thomas Paine once said, and the magazine offered proof of this statement. This article gives its thanks to The Weekly Standard and its writers for their contributions to political discourse and literary excellence.",
    " Title: States Scramble to Protect Abortion Rights as Supreme Court Prepares to Hear Abortion Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in the case Roe v. Wade, enshrining the constitutional right to an abortion. However, with a conservative-leaning Supreme Court and mounting attacks on abortion rights, states across the country are taking steps to protect a woman's right to choose in the event that the historic court decision is overturned.\n\nBonyen Lee-Gilmore, who works on state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood, stated, \"The reality is that the balance of the Supreme Court is not in our favor. We have to be prepared [if] Roe falls. That's just part of the reality of living under the Trump administration.\"\n\nThe effort to protect abortion rights began last year when New York became the first state to enshrine the right to an abortion in its state law, effectively codifying Roe v. Wade. Since then, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Vermont have passed similar laws, while Michigan, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia are considering codifying the right to an abortion. In 2019, statehouses passed more legislation protecting or expanding abortion access than in the entire previous decade.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the confirmation of two conservative justices to the Supreme Court in 2018, red states have been taking the opposite approach, preparing for a post-Roe world. In 2019, four states\u2014Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee\u2014passed legislation known as trigger laws, which would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and 12 states passed abortion bans. In total, eight states now have trigger laws on the books, and 20 have laws that could be used to restrict the right to an abortion if Roe were overturned.\n\nAndrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, stated, \"States are going in widely divergent directions when it comes to both abortion rights and abortion access. We have a group of states last year that were tripping over each other in a race to the bottom to try to ban abortion outright, and then we also had a real record year on the other side.\"\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, roughly 25 million women of reproductive age live in a state where abortion could be banned if Roe is overturned. Millions more are already forced to jump through hoops to access abortions, including 72-hour waiting periods, mandatory counseling, and invasive ultrasound procedures.\n\nIn March, the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since the confirmation of conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The case concerns a 2014 Louisiana law, which requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, a stipulation that opponents of the bill argue would leave the state with only one provider for a population of more than 4.5 million. Although the justices are not expected to overturn Roe outright in this case, legal experts argue that if the court were to rule in favor of the law, access to abortion in states like Louisiana could exist in name only.",
    " Title: Obama Criticizes Justice Department's Decision to Drop Flynn Charges, Cites Risk to Rule of Law\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has criticized the Justice Department for dropping charges against Michael Flynn, his ex-national security adviser, stating that it puts \"the rule of law is at risk.\" The comments were made during a private conversation with former members of his administration, a recording of which was leaked to Yahoo News and reported on Saturday.\n\nIn the web conversation with the Obama Alumni Association, Obama expressed concern over the Justice Department's decision, stating, \"The news over the last 24 hours I think has been somewhat downplayed \u2014 about the Justice Department dropping charges against Michael Flynn... That\u2019s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic - not just institutional norms - but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.\"\n\nHowever, Obama misstated the charges against Flynn, who was accused of making false statements to the FBI, not perjury. In 2017, Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the then-Russian ambassador but later sought to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\nObama cited the Flynn case as a critical reason to vote for his former Vice President, Joseph R. Biden, in the November election against President Trump. He told the group, \"So I am hoping that all of you feel the same sense of urgency that I do.\"\n\nA former president criticizing internal Justice Department decisions is rare, as former chief executives typically avoid wading into political waters. Obama's comments were among his strongest attacks on the Trump administration so far, suggesting that he may become more outspoken as this year's election approaches.\n\nOn Thursday, the Justice Department dropped the case against Flynn, stating that the FBI's 2017 interview with Flynn was not conducted with \"a legitimate investigative basis\" because three weeks earlier, the bureau sought to close the probe, saying it had not uncovered any wrongdoing. Anti-Trump former FBI agent Peter Strzok pushed to keep the case open, according to bombshell court documents released earlier this month.\n\nPresident Trump has pointed the finger at the Obama administration for the Flynn prosecution, which he has repeatedly blasted as corrupt. \"He was targeted by the Obama administration to try to take down a president,\" the president said of Flynn on Thursday. \"And I hope a big price is going to be paid.\"\n\n\"The Obama administration Justice Department was a disgrace, and they got caught. It\u2019s treason,\" Mr. Trump continued.",
    " Title: State Department Delays Release of Clinton Emails Due to Classified Information\n\nArticle:\n\nThe State Department has admitted that the process of reviewing potential classified information in former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's emails has caused a delay in their release, leading to a violation of a federal judge's orders. John F. Hackett, the top open records officer for the department, stated that the government only recently realized the extent of classified information in Mrs. Clinton's communications and is currently working to ensure they are not disclosing sensitive information.\n\nThe department was supposed to have released 15 percent of Mrs. Clinton's emails by the end of July, but as of now, less than 12 percent have been released, with approximately 1,721 pages still to be published. This falls short of the goal set out by Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this year.\n\nMrs. Clinton and her allies have consistently maintained that she did not conduct any classified business on her personal email account, which she used instead of an official secure State Department account. However, an inspector general has found information that should have been classified at the time Mrs. Clinton was sending it. As a result, the State Department is now having to redact all of that information from the released emails.\n\nAll of Mrs. Clinton's messages are government records and should have been stored at the State Department for open records searches. Her unique arrangement of using a private email server meant that, for six years, those messages were not part of the official record, and the State Department was not able to conduct a full, responsive search.\n\nThe State Department only demanded Mrs. Clinton return her emails to the department in 2014, nearly two years after she left office. She complied in December 2014, turning over 55,000 pages, constituting about 30,000 messages. She claimed to have expunged another 32,000 messages that were purely private, and maintains she is now in compliance with the law.\n\nMr. Hackett estimates that the State Department can make up the 1,700-page deficit over the next two months, releasing 6,106 pages of emails in August and another 7,156 in September. This will still leave more than 60 percent of the messages to be released from October through January, the deadline when Judge Contreras has ordered all 30,000 messages to be public.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Allegedly Paid Technology Expert to Manipulate Online Polls for Trump in 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen paid a technology expert to manipulate online polls in Trump's favor in 2015, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. John Gauger, the owner of Red Finch Solutions and chief information officer at Liberty University, said Cohen offered him $50,000 to manipulate two news sites' polls, the Journal reported Thursday, citing a government document and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nGauger said Cohen handed him a Walmart bag loaded with about $12,000 in cash during a 2015 meeting at Cohen's Trump Organization office. Cohen also reportedly threw in a boxing glove he said was once worn by a Brazilian mixed-martial arts fighter. However, Cohen never paid Gauger the remainder of the promised $50,000, the Journal said.\n\nCohen did not deny the report in a tweet Thursday morning, saying, \"What I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of Trump.\"\n\n\"I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it,\" wrote the man who once said he would \"take a bullet\" for the president.\n\nCohen did deny giving Gauger cash. \"All monies paid to Mr. Gauger were by check,\" he said, according to the Journal.\n\nGauger did not appear to have much success at moving the needle in the polls he was paid to manipulate. In January 2014, Cohen asked Gauger to sway a CNBC online poll on the top American business leaders with a program that could vote for Trump repeatedly, the Journal report said. But Trump did not break into the top 100.\n\nIn February 2015, Cohen asked Gauger to boost Trump in a Drudge Report poll on potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates, according to Gauger. Trump ended up coming in fifth with 5 percent of the vote.\n\nCohen also asked Gauger to create a Twitter account with the handle @WomenForCohen that would be run by a female friend of Gauger's to portray Cohen as a \"sex symbol\" and hype his statements in favor of Trump's presidential campaign, the Journal reported.\n\nGauger said the last time he spoke to Cohen was in April 2018, after the lawyer's office, home, and hotel room were raided by the FBI. \"It\u2019s not a big deal,\" Gauger said Cohen told him about the investigation.\n\nLast month, Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison after pleading guilty to crimes related to tax evasion, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress. Although Gauger said Cohen never paid him the full promised amount, Cohen did ask the Trump Organization in January 2017 to reimburse him $50,000 for \"tech services,\" prosecutors for the Southern District of New York said when Cohen was charged in August. The request was made in a handwritten note, along with his bill for the $130,000 in hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels. That payment comprised one of the campaign finance violations to which Cohen pleaded guilty. He claims the payment, which constituted an illegal campaign contribution, was made at Trump's direction.",
    " Title: Tillerson: All Options on Table in Dealing with North Korea, Diplomatic and Military\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has stated that while the U.S. does not wish to engage in military action against North Korea, all options, including military intervention, remain on the table if a significant threat arises. Tillerson made these remarks during a visit to South Korea on Friday, a day after stating that diplomatic efforts have failed to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.\n\nTillerson's Asia tour began in Japan and will conclude in China. The top American diplomat is traveling without a press contingent. In South Korea, Tillerson declared, \"The policy of strategic patience has ended.\" He further stated, \"We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, economic measures. All options are on the table.\"\n\nRegarding potential military action, Tillerson said that while the U.S. would prefer to avoid armed conflict, \"If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, then that option's on the table.\"\n\nJoseph DeTrani, former special envoy for six-party talks with North Korea, told NPR's Audie Cornish, \"I think he's being very straight with China, and the regional allies in the Asia region\u2014South Korea and Japan\u2014that we're looking at negotiations all the way to preemption. If there's an imminent strike against the United States, we have to look at all options on the table.\"\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear threat and recent missile tests have cast a long shadow over Tillerson's trip. In a news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday, the Korean peninsula was mentioned more than 40 times.\n\nOn Friday, concerns about North Korea prompted a missile evacuation drill on Japan's coast, where more than 100 residents of a town heard sirens and were told to take cover in an exercise that is seen as unprecedented.\n\nDeTrani told NPR, \"We've got to be as creative, we've got to be as forward-leaning as possible to give North Korea those off-ramps so they realize there are opportunities available to them that will not be available if they continue on the path of building nuclear and missile capabilities.\"\n\n\"And part of that will be international legitimacy\u2014normal relations with the United States\u2014but also part of that will be having a better relationship with the country that, whether they like it or not, they're tethered to, and that's the People's Republic of China,\" DeTrani added.\n\nTillerson will head to China this weekend, where he is expected to push Beijing to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. He is also expected to plan for a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet with President Trump at Trump's private club in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, next month, although this has not been formally announced yet.\n\nFor its part, China wants its relations with the U.S. to remain stable, so as not to distract from a leadership reshuffle this fall.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Address Controversial Issues During Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to begin its next term on Monday, with a series of contentious issues that neither President Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney appear eager to discuss. The justices' docket includes the racially polarizing question of affirmative action, same-sex marriage, and the federal government's terrorist surveillance program.\n\nThe case on the University of Texas's affirmative action program, scheduled for argument on October 10, could reintroduce an issue that has been absent from the national political discourse for over a decade. The first presidential debate, focusing on domestic issues, is set for exactly one week before this case. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 11.\n\nRichard Taylor, a business diversity advocate and former Massachusetts transportation secretary under Romney, expressed doubt that either candidate would publicly comment on these issues. \"I\u2019ve got to believe at this point in the campaign neither the president or Governor Romney is going to want to give a quote on any of this,\" Taylor said.\n\nIn court briefs, the Obama administration has supported the University of Texas's right to run its affirmative action program, which is being challenged by Abigail Fisher, a white undergraduate applicant who was denied admission. However, Obama aides have a history of being cautious about engaging in debates over race, particularly those related to education-related affirmative action.\n\nA federal government policy statement on the use of race in education was delayed for three years due to protracted interagency debates before its release in December 2019. John Brittain, a civil rights activist and law professor at the University of the District of Columbia, noted the administration's reluctance to address race and equality, stating, \"The administration had a paralysis of analysis... Overall, the Obama administration just has a reluctance to take on race and equality, and when they do so everything is so carefully sanitized and scrubbed to make sure it\u2019s the least offensive thing possible.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's docket could potentially influence the presidential race, as it did last term with the 5-4 decision upholding the crux of Obama's signature health law. However, it is unlikely that the justices will rule on any of these issues before the election.",
    " Title: President Obama Signs Bipartisan Budget Bill, Ending Fiscal Brinkmanship for Two Years\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed a bipartisan budget bill on Thursday, marking an end to the cycle of fiscal brinkmanship for the next two years. The Senate approved the spending measure last week, following its passage in the Republican-dominated House. The president also signed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2014.\n\nThe bill, signed while Obama was vacationing in Hawaii, reduces across-the-board cuts already scheduled to take effect, restoring about $63 billion over two years. It includes a projected $85 billion in other savings. The deal prevents another government shutdown for nearly two years.\n\nThe bill authorizes appropriations for Department of Defense programs and related spending at other agencies. The act sets out a Pentagon base budget of $526.8 billion in the 2014 fiscal year.\n\nHowever, the defense authorization does not go as far as the president wants in closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. As in past years, Obama attached a signing statement complaining of \"unwarranted and burdensome restrictions\" on transferring detainees out of the prison. Although the law eases those restrictions a bit, making it easier to transfer detainees to foreign countries, Congress still does not allow the White House to move detainees to U.S. soil, making it nearly impossible to close the prison.\n\nObama has stated that the restrictions are \"unwise\" and insists that \"the executive branch must have the authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees.\"",
    " Title: Candidates Campaign in Final 24-Hours, Employing Rock Superstars in Battleground States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final 24-hour stretch of the 2012 Presidential Campaign, both candidates, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, focused their efforts on a select group of voters in a few key states. The candidates traversed six states on Monday, with Mitt Romney starting his day with a rally in Orlando, Florida.\n\nRomney declared, \"One final push is going to get us there!\" before moving on to Virginia, Ohio, and New Hampshire. Both campaigns have transformed the final day of campaigning into a musical extravaganza, with each candidate enlisting popular musicians to support their campaign messages.\n\nBruce Springsteen accompanied Obama on his tour through Wisconsin, Ohio, and Iowa, while Jay-Z is expected to join Obama in Ohio. Romney, on the other hand, was supported by The Marshall Tucker Band in Columbus, Ohio, and Kid Rock in Manchester, New Hampshire, in the evening.\n\nIn Madison, Wisconsin, Obama, with a hoarse voice, urged voters to help him \"finish what we started.\" He criticized Romney for attempting to \"repackage the same old, bad ideas\" as change and used the Clinton administration's economic record of the '90s as evidence that Democratic ideas \"work.\"\n\n\"This should not be that complicated. We tried our ideas, they worked. We tried their ideas, they didn't work,\" Obama said.\n\nRomney, in Florida, continued to emphasize that Obama is hindering the economic recovery and that his removal from office would unleash the potential of America's entrepreneurs.\n\n\"The door to a brighter future is open, it's waiting for us. I need your vote, I need your help,\" Romney said. \"Tomorrow, we begin a new tomorrow.\"\n\nRomney claimed his campaign has gained momentum in recent weeks and transformed into a \"movement.\" Indeed, Romney saw a significant increase in the polls following his first debate against Obama. However, the race remains close at the national level, and in the battleground states where the election will be decided, voters are evenly split.\n\nBy most estimates, Obama enters Election Day with a slight advantage in the electoral vote count. The RealClearPolitics electoral map shows states likely to vote for Obama are worth 201 electoral votes, while those likely to vote for Romney are worth 191. A total of 270 electoral votes is required to win.\n\nThe toss-up states include Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Ohio, with 18 electoral votes, is considered crucial for either candidate, and both candidates were campaigning there on Monday.\n\nA poll released Sunday in The Pittsburgh Tribune showed the race in Pennsylvania locked at 47 percent in the final week. The president's team, however, considered the Pennsylvania move a \"Hail Mary\" and a sign that Romney still does not have a clear pathway to reaching the required electoral votes.\n\nBoth candidates pledged to govern in a bipartisan manner for the next four years as they attempted to reach independent and undecided voters.\n\n\"I want all parties to work together,\" the president said at a rally in Hollywood, Florida. \"We're not Democrats and Republicans first. We're Americans first... As long as I'm president, I will work with anybody, of any party, to move this country forward.\"",
    " Title: Trump Appeals to Supreme Court to Block Release of Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting it to reverse a court order mandating his accountants to hand over eight years of tax returns. This move marks a significant escalation in Trump's efforts to keep his financial records private.\n\nThe federal appeals court in New York last week upheld a subpoena issued to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his personal and corporate financial records from 2011 to 2018. In their petition to the Supreme Court, Trump's personal lawyers described the records request as \"politically motivated\" and argued that the subpoena should not be allowed to infringe upon the immunity the Constitution grants to the president.\n\nJay Sekulow, Trump's lawyer, stated, \"We have filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Second Circuit decision regarding a subpoena issued by the New York County District Attorney.\" The petition asserts that the subpoena violates the U.S. Constitution and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\nA three-judge panel of the Second Circuit last week allowed Manhattan prosecutors to obtain Trump's financial records as part of a grand jury investigation. Cyrus Vance Jr., the Democratic district attorney for New York County, agreed not to enforce the subpoena because Trump's lawyers vowed to quickly appeal to the Supreme Court. Vance's office is investigating payments allegedly made to silence two women who claim they had affairs with Trump.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that the president has blanket immunity from criminal prosecution. During a recent oral argument before the circuit court, Trump's personal lawyer William Consovoy argued that the president could not be prosecuted even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nThe three judges on the circuit court panel, all Democratic appointees, did not rule on all of Trump's broad claims of immunity and whether the president could be prosecuted. However, they ruled that any immunity Trump had did not cover a subpoena to his accounting firm.\n\nTrump has faced criticism for not voluntarily releasing his tax returns, breaking with a decades-long tradition of presidents doing so. This Supreme Court petition represents a final attempt by Trump to keep the documents hidden.\n\nThis case is one of two legal battles over subpoenas for Trump's financial records that were expected to reach the Supreme Court. In a separate case in Washington, D.C., a federal appeals court on Wednesday cleared the way for House Democrats on the Oversight Committee to pursue Trump's financial records from Mazars. Trump's lawyers indicated they would also appeal that decision to the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: SpaceX Launches First Private Rocket to Carry American Astronauts into Orbit\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Saturday, a rocket ship built by Elon Musk's SpaceX company, carrying two American astronauts, blasted off from Earth, marking a new era in commercial space travel and the first time in nearly a decade that the United States has launched astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil. NASA's Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode into space aboard a Falcon 9 rocket and a sleek, white-and-black Dragon capsule, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used for the Apollo moon missions. Minutes later, they safely entered orbit.\n\nThe mission, named Demo-2, is scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months. After their return to Earth in a \"Right Stuff\"-style splashdown at sea, the astronauts will have completed the first crewed flight by a private company.\n\nThe mission unfolded amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and racial unrest in the U.S. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine expressed hope that the flight would serve as a morale-booster for the nation. \"Maybe there's an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,\" he said before launch.\n\nWith the successful launch, SpaceX, founded by Musk, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat previously achieved only by three governments: the U.S., Russia, and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Since retiring the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nThe mission is the latest milestone for NASA's commercial crew program, a partnership between the agency, SpaceX, and Boeing. The first attempt on Wednesday was scrubbed at the last minute due to bad weather. Space exploration and adjacent businesses, such as space tourism and long-haul travel on Earth, are expected to grow into a more than $800 billion industry in the next decade.\n\nNASA has also partnered with private companies for its Artemis program, which aims to land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024. In addition to SpaceX, NASA has selected a team led by Blue Origin, founded by Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, and Dynetics, a subsidiary of Leidos Holdings, to work on the landing systems for the Artemis program.\n\nThe commercial crew program's future launch dates are not yet scheduled, according to NASA. After a series of flight tests by both Boeing and SpaceX this year and in 2019, NASA is now free to focus on building spacecraft and rockets for deep space missions while the companies focus on providing human transportation services to and from low-Earth orbit.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Mormon Faith Remains a Campaign Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's Mormon faith has emerged as a significant aspect of his presidential campaign, with the media scrutinizing his religious beliefs and their potential impact on voters. Despite the Latter-day Saints (LDS) Church having a significant presence in the Senate, Romney's Mormonism remains a mystery and potential obstacle for many voters.\n\nThe White Horse prophecy, attributed to Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, has gained attention due to its connection with Romney's political aspirations. This prophecy, which predicts the rise of Mormons in times of economic and constitutional crisis, has been a topic of conversation among church members and has been linked to important themes in mainstream Mormonism, such as the belief in the divinely inspired Framers and the special role of Mormons in preserving the Constitution.\n\nHowever, Romney has been cautious about discussing his religious beliefs in detail, referring to his faith as similar to that of other Americans. This has left journalists and observers searching for clues about Romney's religious views. The attention given to Mormon views of the Constitution provides a glimpse into how this issue may play out on the campaign trail.\n\nThe White Horse prophecy, which predicts the preservation of the U.S. Constitution by Mormons, is a controversial and well-known aspect of the prophecy. This prophecy is known to many church members and continues to be a topic of conversation among Mormons today. Romney has mentioned the divine influence on the Constitution several times during his campaign, suggesting a belief in its divine inspiration.\n\nThe prophecy is one of the most debated aspects of Romney's Mormon faith, even among believers. Like Mormonism itself, which has a distinctively American heartbeat, the prophecy is intertwined with American history and politics. The prophecy warns of trouble in the Middle East and anti-Mormon sentiment in the government, predicting the near-destruction of the U.S. Constitution. However, it also predicts the preservation and saving of the Constitution by the White Horse, who will stand by the Constitution as it was given by divine inspiration. The prophecy also mentions a Black Horse, which is commonly interpreted as representing American blacks, who will side with England and France, but eventually submit to the White Horse as the religion fulfills its world-conquering destiny in an Armageddon-style war with the Russians, while keeping an eye on the looming threat of China.\n\nIn conclusion, Mitt Romney's Mormon faith remains a significant and controversial aspect of his presidential campaign. The White Horse prophecy, with its predictions of economic and constitutional crises and the role of Mormons in preserving the Constitution, has gained attention and is a topic of conversation among church members and political observers. Romney's beliefs and potential connection to the prophecy remain a mystery, with the candidate being cautious about discussing his religious views in detail. The prophecy's connection to American history and politics, as well as its role in shaping the beliefs of Mormon church members and leaders, provides a unique insight into the intersection of religion and politics in the United States.",
    " Title: Doug Jones' Victory in Alabama Senate Race Reflects Trends in Recent Democratic Wins\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic victory, Democrat Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a statewide office in Alabama since 2008, defeating Republican Roy Moore in a special election on Tuesday to fill the Senate seat previously held by Jeff Sessions. Jones secured 49.9% of the votes, while Moore garnered 48.4%. This marks the first time a Democrat has won a Senate race in Alabama since 1992, when GOP Senator Richard Shelby was still a Democrat.\n\nThe Alabama Senate special election exhibited several unique factors, including a GOP nominee accused of pursuing relationships with teenage girls, a controversial figure in the state, a mid-December vote, and a Democratic nominee who outspent his GOP rival by a significant margin during the general election phase of the campaign.\n\nHowever, the Alabama results also reflect trends observed in prior elections, such as the race for governor in Virginia this year, that could indicate favorable conditions for Democrats in the 2018 mid-term elections, where control of the House of Representatives and now the Senate will be at stake.\n\nThis emerging Democratic advantage includes energized support from non-white voters, elevated party turnout in metropolitan areas, and stronger performance in well-educated suburban communities. Conversely, Republican turnout in white rural counties, which provided a significant boost to Donald Trump in 2016, has reportedly lagged in two key contests, the Virginia gubernatorial election and Tuesday's Alabama Senate race.\n\nJames A. Barnes, a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the 2018 Almanac of American Politics, provided insights into the Alabama Senate race and its implications for the upcoming mid-term elections.",
    " Title: WIRED Concedes \"Right-Wing Stunt\" Contains Valid Concerns About WHO's Handling of COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nA technology magazine, WIRED, published an article on Sunday that acknowledged a \"right-wing stunt\" as containing a valid notion regarding the World Health Organization's (WHO) handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tweet from WIRED read, \"A right-wing stunt to pin the blame for Covid-19 on the World Health Organization actually contains a useful notion. There is at least some reason to suspect that WHO knowingly and consequentially misled us.\"\n\nThe article, written by WIRED's \"Ideas Contributor,\" expressed surprise at finding himself in agreement with conservative views, citing a call from Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) to investigate the WHO to determine if the United States should freeze their significant, taxpayer-funded contribution. The author describes his unexpected alignment with conservatives, stating that he is not in favor of cutting WHO funding or conducting the investigation immediately, but he is not as sure as Scott that WHO is guilty as charged.\n\nThe article points out the WHO's controversial tweet from January that claimed there was no evidence from China suggesting human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, despite ample evidence to the contrary. The author suggests that the \"right-wing stunt\" could be seen as an assessment of evidence and consequences that led to a lack of faith in the WHO.\n\nAs the global Wuhan coronavirus pandemic continues, people of all political stripes have shifted significant blame to the Chinese Communist Party for concealing the nature of the disease. Blame has then naturally trickled down to the WHO, who seemed to have, for whatever reason, a vested interest in protecting the CCP.\n\nWhile the media has consistently criticized President Trump for his response to the outbreak of the Wuhan Coronavirus in the U.S., particularly in the early days, it is difficult for even his most unflappable foes to ignore the errors and misguidance of the WHO.",
    " Title: Understanding Trump's Communication Style: Serious, Not Literal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an article for The Atlantic last September, reporter Salena Zito noted a distinct difference in the way news media and Trump supporters interpret the statements made by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. The media tends to take Trump's more outlandish statements literally but not seriously, while his supporters do the inverse.\n\nThis distinction, often referred to as the \"seriously, not literally\" approach, has been credited as a key to understanding Trump's communication style. Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, highlighted this at a post-election conference at Harvard, stating, \"You guys took everything Donald Trump said so literally. The American people didn't.\"\n\nPeter Thiel, a major Trump backer, made a similar point at the National Press Club in October, stating, \"The media always is taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously... I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously, but not literally.\"\n\nTrump himself has hinted that he agrees with this interpretation. Last week, he admitted that he never meant his statement in April, \"We're not going to let Carrier leave,\" literally. He explained, \"I said, 'Carrier will never leave.' But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in.\"\n\nThe press's treatment of Trump as a joke, not appreciating the fact that for many voters, the media's scorn is a badge of honor, is a point of criticism in this distinction.\n\nWhile this distinction is a useful analytical tool for understanding candidate Trump's communication, it is questionable as a prescription for how to treat an actual president or president-elect of the United States.\n\nFor instance, when Trump claims millions of people voted illegally, or speaks on the telephone with the president of Taiwan, how should the news media go about interpreting these statements \"seriously but not literally\"?\n\nPerhaps the \"seriously, not literally\" distinction should not be taken too literally. Perhaps what Trump supporters really mean is that he should get a free pass whenever his mouth gets him in trouble.\n\nTrump has stated, \"I know words, I have the best words.\" He has also claimed he could be more presidential than anybody, except maybe Abraham Lincoln. He would be well-advised to take his own words seriously, if not literally.\n\nWhat a president says matters. Credibility\u2014with citizens, allies, enemies, and markets\u2014is a finite resource, easily depleted when you think you'll never be held to account for what you blurt out.",

Bush was kept in the dark about the interrogations, asserting that Bush was informed of everything he needed to know.\n\nThe Democrat-led Senate intelligence committee released the report on Tuesday, which criticized the CIA's interrogation practices as \"brutal and far worse\" than the agency represented to lawmakers. The report also claimed that the techniques were not effective and that the CIA provided \"inaccurate\" information about the practices to Congress and the White House.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the head of the intelligence panel who ordered the release of the report, alleged on the Senate floor that the CIA techniques in some cases amounted to \"torture.\" She argued that the report's release was necessary to uphold a just society governed by law and to prevent similar actions in the future.\n\nThe White House and President Obama supported the decision to release the report, despite concerns from lawmakers and some within the administration that it could lead to a backlash against Americans.

The Supreme Court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices appointed by Trump, has already provided victories on some policy issues for the Republican president, such as upholding his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nHowever, as the focus of some of the major legal challenges shifts from Trump's policies to the president himself, there could be disappointments for him, particularly if the Supreme Court upholds the ability of Congress to pursue investigations of the president, according to some legal experts.\n\nConservative legal scholar J.W. Verret, an expert in corporate and securities law at George Mason University in Virginia, stated, \"That means upholding lower court decisions finding proper legislative purpose in recent inquiries regarding tax and financial fraud subpoenas.\"\n\nTrump and his administration have defied a series of subpoenas issued by the Democratic-led House of Representatives, seeking testimony from current and former administration officials, as well as documents covering matters such as his tax returns, banking records, family business interests, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump's actions to impede the inquiry.\n\nThe president and his lawyers have defiantly challenged the oversight authority of Congress, a stance that Democrats have framed as an attack on the separation of powers. Trump has sued to try to block enforcement of certain subpoenas, losing thus far in lower courts. House Democrats, who are divided on whether to launch the impeachment process, appear poised to press the matter by bringing their own court actions to try to enforce their subpoenas.\n\nOther lawsuits, including one brought by congressional Democrats, also accuse Trump of violating an anti-corruption provision in the Constitution, called the emoluments clause, by continuing to accept payments from foreign governments through his businesses, including a downtown Washington hotel.\n\nSome of Trump's losses in lower courts are already on appeal, and potentially could come before the Supreme Court with decisions issued during the heat of the election season.\n\nStuart Gerson, a Republican former Justice Department official and former acting U.S. attorney general, said the Supreme Court might be skeptical if the aim of subpoenas by Democratic lawmakers is merely to \"educate the American people and build up a tide for impeachment that doesn't exist now.\"\n\n\"There's no black and white,\" Gerson added. \"It will be 'win some, lose some,' and the Supreme Court, I think, given its precedent, will define a middle ground.\"\n\nWilliam Consovoy, Trump's lead lawyer on cases involving his business dealings, did not respond to a request seeking comment. The White House declined to comment for this story.\n\nTrump has professed his faith in the Supreme Court and the importance of a president's role in making lifetime appointments to the top U.S. judicial body. Trump has said his promise to name conservative justices was a \"main reason\" why he was elected in 2016. His two appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, have deepened the conservative hold on the court.\n\nAside from the travel ban, Trump's policy victories at the Supreme Court have included implementation of his ban on most transgender people in the U.S. military and blocking Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from being deposed in a lawsuit over the contentious plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. His administration has sought to bypass lower courts by rushing certain appeals of adverse rulings to the high court.\n\nTrump's lawyers have justified stonewalling subpoenas by arguing that the Democratic demands exceed congressional authority, are overly broad, or improperly invade Trump's private affairs. Federal judges have rejected those arguments, citing Supreme Court precedent that Congress has broad authority to investigate corruption or improper conduct in the workings of government.\n\nIf federal appeals courts uphold judges' rulings that side with Congress, Verret predicted the Supreme Court would deliver \"either a 9-0 outcome in support\" of the lower courts or would simply refuse to hear the administration's appeal, leaving the lower court rulings intact.\n\n\"This goes to precedent involving core congressional oversight power,\" Verret added.\n\nPeople exit and stand outside of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 17, 2019. \u2588\u2588\u2588/Leah Millis\n\nThe Supreme Court's first taste of the fight between Trump and congressional Democratic could come in two fast-moving cases. Trump is trying to block subpoenas for financial records issued to his accounting firm, Mazars LLP, and two banks with which he has done business: Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. Judges in Washington and New York, respectively, ruled that the subpoenas could be enforced. Trump has appealed in both cases and could seek to bring them to the Supreme Court if he keeps losing in lower courts.\n\nThe emoluments issue also could be heading toward the justices. The Supreme Court will likely have the final say concerning potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump's Washington hotel and other business interests \"because courts have never had to deal with this in 200-plus years,\" said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a law professor at Stetson University College of Law in Florida.",
    " Title: Paris: 12 Killed in Attack on Satirical Newspaper Charlie Hebdo\n\nArticle:\n\nA terrorist attack occurred on Wednesday in Paris, France, at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, resulting in the deaths of 12 people, including the editor and a cartoonist. This is France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande described the attack as \"a terrorist attack without a doubt.\" He stated that several other attacks have been thwarted in France \"in recent weeks.\" No immediate claim of responsibility for the attack has been made.\n\nIn response, France raised its security alert to the highest level and increased protective measures at houses of worship, stores, media offices, and transportation. Top government officials are holding an emergency meeting, and Hollande plans a nationally televised address in the evening. Schools across the French capital have closed their doors.\n\nWorld leaders, including President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have condemned the attack. However, supporters of the militant Islamic State group have celebrated the slayings as well-deserved revenge against France.\n\nThe Islamic State group has repeatedly threatened to attack France. Just minutes before the attack, Charlie Hebdo had tweeted a satirical cartoon of the extremist group's leader giving New Year's wishes. Another cartoon, released in this week's issue and entitled \"Still No Attacks in France,\" had a caricature of an extremist fighter saying \"Just wait \u2014 we have until the end of January to present our New Year's wishes.\"\n\nThe 12 dead included two men who went by the pen names Charb \u2014 the editor and a cartoonist \u2014 and the cartoonist Cabu, according to Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office. Two police officers were also among the dead, including one assigned as Charb's bodyguard after prior death threats against him, a police official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.\n\nMultiple masked men armed with automatic weapons attacked the newspaper's office in central Paris. Nearby worker Benoit Bringer told the iTele network that the attackers went to the second floor and started firing indiscriminately in the newsroom. Christophe DeLoire of Reporters Without Borders described the incident as \"the darkest day of the history of the French press.\"\n\nVideo images on the website of public broadcaster France Televisions showed two gunmen in black at a crossroads who appeared to fire down one of the streets. A cry of \"Allahu akbar!\" \u2014 Arabic for \"God is great\" \u2014 could be heard among the gunshots.\n\nThe attackers left in a waiting car and later switched to another vehicle that had been stolen, according to Luc Poignant of the SBP police union.\n\nUS officials have been in close contact with the French since the attack, according to Obama's top spokesman, Josh Earnest. \"We know they are not going to be cowed by this terrible act,\" Earnest said.\n\nOn social media, supporters of militant Islamic groups praised the move. One Twitter user who identified themselves as a Tunisian loyalist of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State group called the attack well-deserved revenge against France.\n\nElsewhere on the Internet, the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie was trending as people expressed support for the weekly and for journalistic freedom.\n\nCharlie Hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and other controversial sketches. Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the prophet on its cover. Nearly a year later, the publication again published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations from around the Muslim world.\n\nWednesday's attack comes on the same day as the release of a book by a celebrated French novelist depicting France's election of its first Muslim president. Hollande was due to meet with the country's top religious officials later in the day.",
    " Title: Senate Expresses Concern Over Trump's Trade Policy, Votes to Involve Congress in Section 232 Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate took a symbolic step on Wednesday to express concern over President Donald Trump's trade policy, voting to include language in a government funding bill that would provide a role for Congress in tariffs implemented for national security reasons, known as Section 232 of the trade laws.\n\nThe nonbinding vote, which saw 88 senators voting in favor and 11 against, underscores the depth of concern on Capitol Hill regarding Trump's tariff strategy. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) stated that the vote is significant, as many senators have discussed their anxiety about tariffs with the president and his Cabinet.\n\nThe president has used Section 232 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including imposing financial penalties on key trading allies such as the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. However, Republicans have been wary of using legislation to push back against Trump before the midterm elections.\n\nSenate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) attempted to attach legislation requiring congressional approval for tariffs applied for national security reasons to both a defense policy bill and the farm bill, but was blocked both times. Corker stated after the vote that he would continue to push for the Senate to pass stand-alone legislation on Trump's tariff authority.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) added that Congress has to rein in the abuse of presidential authority and restore Congress's constitutional authority in this regard. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has stated he will bring up tariff legislation in the committee, and some GOP senators on the panel have voiced support for narrowing Section 232 of the trade law.\n\nTrump allies have warned lawmakers against passing legislation, arguing it would undercut the president's negotiating ability. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) criticized senators before the vote, stating that they were tying Trump's hands. Perdue was one of the 11 Republican senators who voted no.\n\nThe other Republican senators who voted no were Sens. John Barrasso (Wyo.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Dean Heller (Nev.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), James Inhofe (Okla.), Jim Risch (Idaho), and Tim Scott (S.C.).",
    " Title: Iraq War's Legacy Looms Large in Obama's Syria Decision-Making\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's response to the escalating conflict in Syria appears to be influenced significantly by the events in Iraq, according to former administration officials and analysts. The legacy of the Iraq War is a significant factor in the president's and his advisers' approach to the Syria crisis, as they aim to avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nThreats of chemical weapons use in Syria have prompted the administration to balance the need for a strong response against Obama's repeated \"red line\" statements regarding the use of nerve agents or poison gas by President Bashar Assad's regime.\n\nGreg Craig, a foreign policy adviser on Obama's 2008 campaign and his first White House counsel, noted the impact of the Iraq history, stating, \"He does not want to jump to conclusions or shoot from the hip.\"\n\nThe administration's caution is rooted in the memory of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) 2003 statement, made to President George W. Bush, that Iraq had nuclear weapons. No such weapons were ever found, and the CIA also reported, incorrectly, that Saddam Hussein had an active chemical and biological weapons program.\n\nFormer Clinton national security adviser Sandy Berger, now with the Albright-Stonebridge Group, commented, \"This is actually pretty good example of the kind of situation where it pays to learn the lessons of Iraq.\" Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert with the Monterey Institute of International Studies, added, \"My sense is that they are reluctant to get involved on the basis of evidence that is not, to use a familiar term, a \u2018 slam dunk.'\"\n\nA White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the impact of the Iraq War on the administration's decision-making, stating, \"Given our own history with intelligence assessments, including intelligence assessments related to weapons of mass destruction, it\u2019s very important that we are able to establish this with certainty and that we are able to present information that is airtight in a public and credible fashion to underpin all of our decision-making.\"\n\nThe official further emphasized the need for \"a threshold that is demanded given how serious this issue is.\" The challenges faced by U.S. troops in Iraq may also be a key factor in Obama's reluctance to commit more resources to Syria by directly arming rebels or setting up a no-fly zone.",
    " Title: GOP Presidential Hopefuls Adapt Stances on Common Core, Immigration, and Israel\n\nArticle:\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday challenging the federal Common Core education curriculum. This move positions him among other GOP hopefuls who have recently recalibrated their positions on various issues to align with conservative primary voters.\n\nJindal, who initially endorsed Common Core in 2010, now views it as an example of federal overreach. His change in stance follows similar shifts by other potential 2016 candidates, such as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have revised their positions on immigration and foreign assistance, respectively.\n\nAccording to Darrell M. West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institute, these changes are strategic adjustments to the evolving political climate within the Republican Party. \"They are adapting to new GOP winds and trying to put themselves in the strongest possible position,\" West said. \"This means getting tough on the Common Core, which conservatives hate. It also means becoming more negative on comprehensive immigration reform and making sure they are supportive of Israel.\"\n\nIn the case of Jindal, he has been signaling an increasing aversion to the Common Core, under pressure from conservative and tea party activists in his state. On Wednesday, Jindal filed a lawsuit alleging that the Obama administration illegally coerced states into adopting the standards, which 44 states and the District of Columbia have adopted.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio made a bold statement on immigration a day prior to Jindal's announcement, declaring that there is \"no realistic path forward on comprehensive [immigration] reform for the foreseeable future.\" Essentially, he declared his own legislation dead and suggested a piecemeal approach to addressing the issue, starting with stemming the flow of illegal immigrants into the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Rand Paul has been attempting to reassure voters that he has never supported cutting aid to Israel, despite previous statements to the contrary. The ongoing war in Gaza has fueled a strong response from the party's pro-Israel voices.\n\nFlip-flops in political stances are not uncommon, and often occur well in advance of primary elections. For instance, Mitt Romney was pro-choice as a candidate for governor of Massachusetts but became pro-life ahead of his 2008 and 2012 bids for the GOP presidential nomination. Former Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002 before running against it in the 2008 Democratic primary.\n\nMichael McKenna, a GOP consultant, views these shifts as a testament to the democratic process. \"These shifts are part of what makes popular sovereignty so great \u2014 those who want to get elected have to (ultimately) express the will of the majority of the electorate, or they don't get elected,\" McKenna said in an email. \"And usually people like to do it when not too many folks are watching the evolution. Because it can get misconstrued as being indecisive or, worse, pandering.\"",
    " Title: Hearings Stir Debate on Intellectual Humility, Uncertainty, and Bigotry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings have sparked a debate on intellectual humility, uncertainty, and the potential for bigotry in public discourse. At the center of this controversy lies the question of events that allegedly occurred at a party 36 years ago, for which there is no corroborating evidence.\n\nThe hearings have raised crucial questions about how to handle uncertainty, weigh conflicting testimonies, and measure the credibility of testimonies in light of cognitive science's findings on human beings' inaccuracies in detecting falsehoods. The events of a person's high school years have also been a subject of discussion, with some questioning whether they should define an individual's adult life.\n\nIn the midst of this debate, some have quickly taken sides, either supporting or criticizing the individuals involved. If initial evidence did not provide a clear answer, some have found new reasons to reinforce their initial positions.\n\nThe polarized nature of the discourse has led to an increase in base mobilization, where persuasion is no longer a priority in public conversations. Statements are made to rally one's own group, rather than to seek understanding or truth. For instance, Senator Cory Booker has been criticized for his histrionic approach to the evidence, while Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of stoking culture war rage to mobilize the Republican base.\n\nThis polarization has also led to an epidemic of bigotry, as individuals make assumptions about disfavored groups based on stereotypes. Instances of bigotry have led to miscarriages of justice in the past, such as the conviction of Alfred Dreyfus in 1894, the Central Park Five in 1990, and the Duke lacrosse case.\n\nIn the past month, thousands of people have formed opinions about Kavanaugh's behavior based on their perceptions of \"privileged\" individuals, while others have rallied behind him due to perceived hostility from the \"Left.\" This polarization and the potential for bigotry in decision-making have become significant concerns in the ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Protests in Ferguson Continue Amidst Tension and Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the city of Ferguson, Missouri, tensions remain high as protests continue following the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Despite the violence and looting that occurred late Monday, many protesters remain undeterred, expressing their desire for justice.\n\nOutbreaks of violence were reported, including the flipping, vandalizing, and setting on fire of a police cruiser, as well as the use of pepper gas and arrests by law enforcement. National Guardsmen in riot gear were stationed at the Ferguson Police Department, with protesters and police separated by a single lane of road.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans such as \"We are not your enemy\" and \"We just want justice,\" while some residents armed themselves to protect their properties. Volunteers helped clean up vandalized stores and eateries, and boarded up broken windows and doors.\n\nMissouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered additional National Guardsmen to the area, increasing their numbers from 700 to 2,200. He stated, \"We are bringing more resources to Ferguson and other parts of the region to prevent a repetition of the lawlessness experienced overnight. We must do better and we will.\"\n\nDemonstrations in Ferguson devolved into chaos on Monday night, with buildings burned, stores looted, and shots fired. Protests also took place in several other states, with activists chanting slogans such as \"They have given us no justice! We will give them no peace.\"\n\nAuthorities are hopeful that the majority of protests in the weeks following Brown's death will remain peaceful. St. Louis police are investigating the death of a man found shot and set on fire, which they have not ruled out as being linked to the violence in Ferguson.",
    " Title: Activist Groups Advocating for Open Borders Endorse Democratic Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIllegal alien activist groups, such as United We Dream Action, are endorsing Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the 2020 primary elections. The endorsements come as these candidates aim to gain support in key Super Tuesday primaries in states with significant illegal alien populations, including California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, and North Carolina.\n\nUnited We Dream Action, an organization with illegal aliens among its membership, announced dual endorsements for Warren and Sanders, praising their support for ending all deportations of illegal aliens. The endorsement video states, \"After four years of Trump, there\u2019s absolutely no question that detention camps need to be closed, deportations need to be stopped, and the enforcement machine needs to be taken apart brick by brick.\"\n\nBoth candidates support key provisions of the 'Free to move, free to stay' platform, including shutting down for-profit detention camps, reducing the budgets for ICE and CBP, stopping and reviewing deportations in the first 100 days, issuing executive orders to protect immigrants, dismantling the \"racist enforcement machine,\" and supporting legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship without provisions to harm immigrants.\n\nThe endorsement is particularly beneficial for Warren and Sanders in California, a state with the largest illegal alien and foreign-born population in the country. By election day in November, one-in-five of all California voters will have been born outside the U.S.\n\nIn North Carolina, Sanders is receiving assistance from the open borders lobbying organization Mijente and the Hispanic American Democrats of Mecklenburg County. Members of each group have been canvassing for Sanders, with Oliva Chapela stating, \"You don\u2019t know how many Latinos that I have canvassed and knocked that literally when I tell them about Bernie, they are like \u2018Yeah, of course.\u2019\"\n\nIn prior primaries, such as the Iowa Democrat Caucus, illegal aliens and noncitizens have organized for Sanders, as reported by various media outlets.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders have endorsed a platform that includes decriminalizing U.S.-Mexico border crossings, amnesty for the majority of the 11 to 22 million illegal alien population, and taxpayer-funded healthcare for all illegal aliens, noncitizens, and foreign nationals.\n\nJohn Binder, a reporter for \u2588\u2588\u2588, reported on the endorsements and can be followed on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.",
    " Title: Biden Campaign Advisers Request Removal of Rudy Giuliani from TV News Channels\n\nArticle:\n\nSenior advisers to Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, have written to major TV news channels requesting the exclusion of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, from their programming. The letter, disclosed by The Daily Beast, was penned by Anita Dunn, a former acting White House communications director under Barack Obama, and Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager.\n\nIn the letter, Dunn and Bedingfield argue that Giuliani, who is deeply involved in the Ukraine scandal that has prompted an impeachment inquiry, is spreading false and debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump. They contend that by giving him airtime, the networks are allowing him to introduce increasingly unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\n\nGiuliani has been a frequent presence on network and cable news shows since the emergence of an anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleging that Trump was seeking help from the Ukraine government in his 2020 re-election bid. Under US election law, it is illegal to solicit or gain electoral benefit from any foreign entity.\n\nGiuliani's comments on the Ukraine matter have become increasingly contentious, with some pundits questioning his mental state. He has been involved in heated exchanges with fellow guests on Fox News and has made contradictory statements regarding his involvement in the Ukraine investigation. He has also invoked wild conspiracy theories involving Hillary Clinton, the philanthropist George Soros, and other right-wing bogeymen.\n\nThe most consistent theme in Giuliani's on-air comments has been his attempt to smear Biden, who has been a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the presidential election next year. On ABC's This Week on Sunday, he repeated claims that in 2016, the then-vice president pressured Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor because he was investigating corruption in a gas company on whose board sat Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nHowever, in fact, the investigation into the company, Burisma, was dormant by 2016. Top officials in the Ukraine government have made clear that no evidence of corruption relating to either Biden was found.\n\nIn their letter, the two Biden aides write, \"We demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\" They also touch on the controversy over Giuliani's actual relationship to Trump and his freelance role in US foreign policy, stating that he \"is not a public official, and holds no public office that would entitle him to opine on the nation's airwaves.\"\n\nDunn and Bedingfield also demand that if Giuliani does appear, \"an equivalent amount of time [should be given] to a surrogate for the Biden campaign.\" In response, Giuliani described the letter as an instance of \"the usual left-wing censorship.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Struggles to Reach Consensus on Key Cases, Suggesting Delayed Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Members of the U.S. Supreme Court appear to be grappling with finding a resolution for a significant case, as suggested by Justice Stephen Breyer during a March 28 oral argument. Breyer's comment, made in a closely watched case concerning the redrawing of electoral districts to maintain one party's power, highlights the apparent difficulty the nine justices are experiencing in issuing rulings at their usual pace.\n\nWith five conservatives and four liberals, the court's ideological divide may make finding common ground challenging. President Donald Trump's appointee Neil Gorsuch, who marks his first anniversary as a justice on Tuesday, has restored the court's conservative majority after a 14-month period of ideological parity.\n\nDuring their current term, which began in October and runs through the end of June, the justices must address more weighty and complex cases than usual. One of their most significant cases \u2013 deciding the legality of President Donald Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries \u2013 will not be heard until April 25.\n\nTo date, the high court has issued only 18 rulings in cases already argued this term, lagging behind its normal pace. Numerous major cases remain unresolved, including one on Wisconsin electoral boundaries heard in October and a similar case heard last month involving the same practice of \"partisan gerrymandering\" in Maryland.\n\nOther major cases include a divisive case pitting gay rights against religious liberty, involving a Christian baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, as well as cases concerning fees paid by non-members to unions representing public employees, the right of workers to bring class-action claims against employers, the ability of police to obtain cellphone location data to tie criminal suspects to crimes, and a California law regulating Christian-based anti-abortion facilities.\n\nSupreme Court experts anticipate the justices will issue a larger-than-normal number of 5-4 rulings in the coming months, increasing the chances of conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often sides with the court's four liberals in major cases, casting the deciding votes.\n\n\"It's reasonable to suggest there are going to be fewer unanimous decisions and more division,\" said Nicole Saharsky, a lawyer who frequently argues cases before the court.\n\nThe court usually issues rulings more quickly when the justices are unanimous. To date, it has issued 11 unanimous rulings and seven with dissenting votes, including three that were 5-4. The court's most contentious rulings are typically issued in June.\n\nPart of the slowdown in rulings may be related to the presence of Gorsuch, who has shown signs of being a conservative voice on the bench. Gorsuch has also demonstrated a willingness to question the reasoning of his colleagues, a practice that can delay rulings.\n\n\"There could just be new dynamics one way or another,\" said John Elwood, who has argued multiple cases before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe impasse over partisan gerrymandering was first evident when the court heard arguments on Oct. 3 in a challenge by Democratic voters to Republican-drawn state legislative districts in Wisconsin. Five months later, the justices appeared no closer to resolving the matter when they heard the similar Maryland dispute involving a Democratic-drawn U.S. House of Representatives district.\n\nThe court seemed similarly divided in the worker class action case argued on Oct. 2, the first day of the term. The justices will have to decide whether workers can be forced by companies to sign agreements waiving the right to bring class-action claims against their employer.\n\nBased on the Dec. 5 oral argument, Kennedy will also be the deciding vote in the case of whether the Denver-area Christian baker can be penalized under a Colorado anti-discrimination law or whether the U.S. Constitution's promise of free speech protects him.\n\nThe nine justices have not always been at odds with each other, even on contentious matters. There was no dissent when the court, in February, rejected Trump's bid to immediately end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children.\n\nThe court also showed no divisions when it declined to intervene in another electoral boundaries fight, this time in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe slow pace of rulings may, in part, be due to scheduling, said Kannon Shanmugam, another regular Supreme Court lawyer.\n\n\"The court has had hard, divisive cases earlier in the term,\" he said. \"It's not surprising it might take a while.\"",
    " Title: Giuliani Clarifies Statements on Trump's Payment to Stormy Daniels and James Comey Firing\n\nArticle:\n\nRudy Giuliani, the latest addition to President Donald Trump's legal team, released a statement on Friday to clarify his comments made in several interviews this week regarding the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels and the firing of James Comey.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Wednesday, Giuliani revealed that Trump reimbursed his personal attorney Michael Cohen for the $130,000 payment made to Daniels in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\nIn his statement, Giuliani did not walk back the statement that Trump reimbursed Cohen. However, he attempted to clear the air on several other potentially problematic statements.\n\n\"These are my views,\" Giuliani's statement began. \"First: There is no campaign violation. The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President's family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.\"\n\nGiuliani's comments on Fox & Friends on Thursday seemed to imply that the payment had political implications. He said, \"It wasn't for the campaign,\" but then added, \"Imagine if that [allegation] came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton?\"\n\nThis remark raised questions of whether the payment was campaign-related, and possibly a campaign finance violation, which Trump's legal team denies.\n\nGiuliani continued in his statement, \"Second: My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President's knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters.\"\n\nTrump, last month, had denied having any knowledge about the payment to Daniels in the weeks leading up to Election Day. While Giuliani said this week that Trump made the reimbursement, he also said Thursday that Trump did not know all the details until about 10 days ago.\n\nGiuliani also clarified a comment he made about the firing of James Comey. Giuliani had suggested that Trump fired Comey because he \"would not, among other things, say that [Trump] wasn't a target of the [Russia] investigation.\"\n\n\"It is undisputed that the President's dismissal of former Director Comey\u2014an inferior executive officer\u2014was clearly in his Article II power,\" Giuliani said Friday. \"Recent revelations about former Director Comey further confirm the wisdom of the President's decision, which was plainly in the best interests of our nation.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Trump defended Giuliani, saying, \"When Rudy made the statements\u2014Rudy is great, but Rudy has just started and he wasn't familiar with everything. He's a special guy and he understands that this is a witch hunt.\"",
    " Title: NSA's Data Collection: Amassing Metadata from Telephone and Email Traffic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) has been accumulating databases of \"metadata,\" which includes logs of all telephone calls and similar data on email traffic, following the September 11 attacks. The email data collection program was discontinued in 2011, although it appears that the same data may now be gathered through alternative means.\n\nAccording to recently disclosed documents, America's phone and Internet companies grew apprehensive of NSA demands as the years passed, fearing customer backlash due to their records being shared with the government. In response, the NSA devised a solution: storing the data itself. This reportedly led to the creation of a vast data storage center in Utah, leveraging the declining cost of storage and the advancement of sophisticated search software.\n\nThese extensive databases were once referred to as \"bit buckets\" in the industry\u2014collections of electronic data waiting to be sifted through. James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained, \"They park stuff in storage in the hopes that they will eventually have time to get to it, or that they'll find something that they need to go back and look for in the masses of data. Most of it sits and is never looked at by anyone.\"\n\nAn obscure passage in one of the Snowden documents, rules for collecting Internet data that the Obama administration wrote in secret in 2009 and that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved, suggested that the government was concerned about its ability to process all the data it was collecting. The rules allowed the government to hold on to the data if it could not keep up with the processing. The rules stated that \"the communications that may be retained\" for up to five years \"include electronic communications acquired because of the limitation on the NSA's ability to filter communications.\"\n\nA private expert who occasionally advises the NSA on this technology commented, \"This means that if you can't desalinate all the seawater at once, you get to hold on to the ocean until you figure it out.\"",
    " Title: Iran Nuclear Deal: A Cautious Assessment of Its Impact on War Prospects\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent nuclear agreement between six world powers and Iran, known as the Lausanne framework, has been met with skepticism and criticism, particularly from hawkish factions. The deal, it is argued, is reminiscent of the 1938 Munich Agreement, where British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain is said to have appeased Adolf Hitler, leading to the outbreak of World War II.\n\nHowever, a careful examination of the Lausanne framework reveals a different narrative. The Iranians have agreed to significant concessions, including the reduction of their nuclear centrifuges by 68 percent for at least a decade, a limit on uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent for 15 years, and a 97 percent reduction in their current stockpile of low-enriched uranium. The once-secret enrichment plant at Fordo will be converted to a \"research center,\" and the heavy water reactor at Arak, capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, will be redesigned and rebuilt to prevent this.\n\nDespite these concessions, Iran's history of deception and support for terror groups like Hezbollah and murderous regimes like Syria remains a concern. To address this, the U.S. and its allies have demanded regular and intrusive access for international inspectors, not just of Iran's nuclear facilities, but of their supply chains. Sanctions that have crippled a broad swath of the Iranian economy will remain in place and be lifted gradually and only when the U.S. and others are satisfied that their demands are being met.\n\nCritics of the deal accuse President Obama of selling out Israel, comparing him to Neville Chamberlain. However, this comparison is misleading. Iran is not a vanquished power, and the demands placed on Iran are far from the complete disarmament that Chamberlain demanded of Germany in 1938. Diplomacy and arms reduction is a process of gradualism, with each side cautiously taking interim steps and searching for common ground.\n\nFurthermore, the Obama administration has taken steps to support Israel's security, such as increased funding for the Iron Dome missile defense system and the provision of bunker buster bombs to Israel. Former Reagan foreign policy advisor Elliott Abrams and Ehud Barak, Netanyahu's former defense minister, have praised the Obama administration's efforts in this regard.\n\nWhile the deal is not perfect, and the Iranian government's intentions remain suspect, the Lausanne framework provides a means of monitoring Iran's nuclear activities more closely than any other country in the world. If Iran cheats, the world will be able to detect it, and further action can be taken. The deal, therefore, offers a cautious hope for avoiding war in the Middle East.",
    " Title: Media Response to President Trump's Helsinki Summit Clarification Remains Critical\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's attempt to clarify his statements made during the Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin has been met with skepticism and criticism from the mainstream media. The president's explanation that he misspoke during the summit, stating that he meant to say \"would not\" instead of \"would,\" has been widely dismissed and, in some cases, mocked.\n\nThe president's demeanor during his clarification was less than enthusiastic, and he added that in addition to Russian hackers, it could have been \"other people\" interfering in the 2016 election. This statement drew particular skepticism, with some media outlets and personalities questioning the authenticity of his remarks.\n\nCNN's Erin Burnett described Trump's explanation as a \"dog ate my homework\" alibi, while The Washington Post observed that Trump's delivery of the statement was classic, offering a dual message to both those who insist on respecting the nation's systems and mores and those who support Trump for his willingness to disrupt traditional politics.\n\nAnother clarification was made after the press ran with a terse Trumpian response\u2014 \"no\"\u2014to ABC reporter Cecilia Vega's question about whether he believes Russia is still meddling in American politics. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later stated that Trump was simply saying \"no\" to the idea of taking questions, not addressing Moscow's current capabilities.\n\nThe New York Times questioned whether this latest episode would be an indelible stain or simply fade into the next one, while some commentators have gone as far as to accuse Trump of being a traitor. This is a charge that reveals the deep-seated disdain some journalists hold for Donald Trump.\n\nIt is important to note that the media's response to President Trump's statements and actions is a reflection of the ongoing political discourse and does not necessarily indicate a consensus or unified position among all media outlets or journalists. The media's role is to report on events and provide analysis, and it is up to the reader or viewer to form their own opinions based on the information presented.",
    " Title: Walker's Position on Birthright Citizenship Remains Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate surrounding the end of birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants has been a hot topic in recent political discussions, with Donald Trump advocating for its termination. This issue is not new to the conservative political sphere, and several candidates, including Scott Walker, have expressed support for the idea.\n\nHowever, Walker's stance on the matter remains unclear. In an interview with NBC's Kasie Hunt, his response seemed to be more of a dodge rather than a clear affirmation of support. When asked directly if he supports ending birthright citizenship, Walker responded:\n\n\"Well, like I said, Harry Reid said it\u2019s not right for this country\u2014I think that\u2019s something we should, yeah, absolutely, going forward\u2014HUNT: We should end birthright citizenship? WALKER: Yeah, to me it\u2019s about enforcing the laws in this country.\"\n\nHis campaign later clarified his statement, asserting that enforcing the laws, securing the border, and implementing E-Verify would end the birthright citizenship issue.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with CNBC's John Harwood, Walker stated that he has no opinion on the issue, only expressing his intention to secure the border before addressing birthright citizenship. This response has been met with confusion, as it contradicts the assertive, anti-establishment stance that Walker's campaign had recently adopted.\n\nThe lack of clarity in Walker's position on this constitutional issue has raised questions about his ability to take a firm stance on key political matters. This is among the more notable instances of ambiguity in recent political discourse, following Jeb Bush's statement that he could not give his opinion on the Iraq war due to potential offense to the troops.",
    " Title: TSA's Effectiveness in Airport Security Called into Question as Research Suggests Alternatives\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has recently concluded a month-long contest aimed at shortening the time travelers spend in airport security lines. The TSA plans to award $15,000 in prize money to the applicants with the best ideas, but one suggestion, disbanding the TSA and liberalizing security, has been proposed.\n\nAir travel has been a common experience for individuals since late 2001, and the check-in procedures have become cumbersome. Before flying, passengers must present ID, undergo searches of their person and property, and limit what they bring in their carry-on luggage. Many airports recommend passengers arrive no later than 90 minutes to two hours before their departure time to clear security.\n\nThe TSA's policies have been a subject of debate, with some considering them an unacceptable invasion of privacy, while others argue they are necessary for security. However, a report from the RAND Corporation states that air travel is incredibly safe. Between 2001 and 2011, more than 6 billion enplanements occurred, and during that time, more people died in incidents related to mechanical failures on aircraft than in security-related scenarios. When security-related incidents did occur, perpetrators were often apprehended by passengers, not by airport security.\n\nIf security is needed, how does the TSA perform compared to alternatives? One of its main jobs is to detect explosives. An internal agency report in 2011 found TSA was largely ineffective in this regard. When tested, agents at two of the nation's busiest airports failed to detect fake bombs 60 percent or 75 percent of the time. Compare these rates to those of private airport security. The Government Accountability Office reported that private screeners missed fake explosives only 40 percent of the time, and this was in 1990, when security technology was much less advanced than today.\n\nThe TSA's poor performance can be attributed to its bureaucratic structure. Unlike for-profit firms, the agency does not face the right incentives. In a market setting, private firms contend with profit and loss. Earning a profit signals that a firm is providing a valuable service to the public and should continue its activities. A loss conveys the opposite. This profit-and-loss mechanism gives private firms incentives to please their customers and invent new and better ways to provide their services.\n\nA bureaucratic organization such as the TSA, however, does not face such feedback. Instead, a bureaucracy looks to increase its share of government funds. It does so in two ways. First, it tries to signal to the larger government that its work fulfills major government objectives and should be expanded. TSA officials do this by claiming their agency prevents acts of terrorism. Second, a bureaucracy expands by exhausting its budget and demonstrating that it can not accomplish its goals with the resources given. In the context of the TSA, this implies the organization has an incentive to get worse, not better, by continuously expanding its budget and security procedures. If the TSA were to rapidly improve speed and efficiency, this would show the government that the agency could do the same job with fewer resources. Budgets would be cut, and personnel would be released. Unlike a private firm facing competitive pressures, the TSA does not benefit from reducing costs, improving performance, and increasing speed.\n\nThe TSA's recent contest may show that the organization knows it's less than loved by travelers, but we shouldn't expect it to radically improve our flying experience. The contest won't change the underlying incentives it faces. The TSA, a government-run bureaucracy, lacks the incentives to adapt, innovate, and cut costs. If we are really looking to increase airport security and reduce air-travel time, we should abolish it.\n\nAbigail R. Hall, a research fellow at the Independent Institute, a nonpartisan research and educational organization based in Oakland, Calif., made these suggestions.",
    " Title: Obama's Visit to Hiroshima: Focus on Nuclear Disarmament and the Loss of Innocent Lives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2009, President Obama expressed his aspiration for a world without nuclear weapons. However, the reality of nuclear proliferation, particularly by North Korea, has posed a challenge to this vision. As Obama's presidency nears its end, he has chosen to revisit this ideal in Hiroshima, a city that serves as a reminder of the devastating impact of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe administration has stated that the president's trip will focus on the future, but it is fraught with potential for misinterpretation. In describing the visit, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes emphasized that the president would highlight the loss of innocent lives, not only from the \"extraordinary loss of life of innocent Japanese civilians\" at Hiroshima but also the overall \"toll that war takes on innocent life.\" Rhodes described Hiroshima and Nagasaki as symbols of \"the toll of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nHistoric context, however, appears to be absent from Rhodes' narrative, and potentially from the president's visit. This context includes the 2,403 innocents killed at Pearl Harbor and the millions of American, Allied, and Japanese casualties spared by the rapid culmination of the war in August 1945.\n\nObama's presence in Hiroshima could also undermine burgeoning efforts at Japanese-South Korean reconciliation. The visit may affirm the Korean view that Washington has \"chosen\" Tokyo over Seoul and now accepts revisionist history depicting Japan as the victim.\n\nHiroshima represents not just the tragedy of a weapon of war, but also the consequences of aggressive regimes and the wars they impose. The Axis Powers may be gone, but modern-day despots remain. More important than an end to nuclear weapons, President Obama should instead call upon all nations to unite against totalitarian regimes that still seek to impose their will over weaker neighbors.",
    " Title: Congress Repeals Auto Lending Guidance Regarding Discrimination Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been criticized by some as potentially discriminatory, President Trump has signed a bill that repeals a guidance document issued by the Obama administration in 2013 regarding auto dealers' ability to mark up interest rates on auto loans. The repeal allows car dealerships to once again negotiate higher interest rates on auto loans, a practice that has been linked to racial disparities in lending.\n\nThe Obama administration's rule was implemented in response to reports indicating that black and Hispanic car buyers were paying higher interest rates on their loans compared to white car buyers. These \"indirect\" loans originate from a third-party financial institution, which returns a portion of the higher interest rate back to the car dealership.\n\nSupporters of the practice argue that it provides car dealers and lenders with the flexibility needed to offer discounted auto loans to their most favorable customers.\n\nThe auto lending rule is unique because it was a guidance document, not a regulation, and was not technically subject to the normal regulatory process. As a result, it was not submitted to Congress for review, and interested groups never had the opportunity to provide comments on the rule.\n\nThe repeal of the rule was made possible by the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a law that allows Congress to overturn agency regulations. The CRA typically allows 60 legislative days for Congress to overturn a rule, but, as a guidance document, the auto lending rule did not go through the normal regulatory process.\n\nThe House voted 234 to 175 to repeal the rule, and the Senate voted 51 to 47. The votes were largely along party lines, with Democrats voting to keep the rule in place. Under the CRA, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is barred from issuing any similar rule unless Congress grants it specific authority.",
    " Title: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Proposes Journalistic Rating Website Amid Media Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter on Wednesday to express his discontent with the media, issuing a series of tweets that criticized the \"hypocrisy of big media companies\" and floated the idea of a website where the public could rate journalists and articles for credibility.\n\nMusk began by stating, \"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them.\" He continued by claiming that journalists are under constant pressure to maximize clicks and earn advertising dollars, or risk being fired.\n\n\"Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn't advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among the world's biggest advertisers,\" Musk said.\n\nIn response to a Twitter user's comment on his remarks, Musk suggested, \"the media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.\" Musk also discussed creating a site, possibly called Pravda, where people could rate the core truth of any article and keep track of the credibility of a journalist or news outlet. He also created a poll, asking followers to choose whether the website was a good idea.\n\nPravda was the name of a Communist newspaper in the former Soviet Union.\n\nRecent backlash towards Musk's company, Tesla, due to a number of crashes involving its vehicles, has been a topic of discussion. In one incident in Utah this month, the driver of a Tesla that crashed into a truck at 60 mph told police that she had the vehicle's autopilot feature turned on. Musk reacted at the time, tweeting that it was \"super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front-page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in the past year get almost no coverage.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's comments, Musk also responded to individual reporters, including one who drew a comparison to President Trump. In response to a reporter who said Musk was continuing \"his slow transformation into a media-baiting Trump figure screaming irrationally about fake news,\" the Tesla CEO replied, \"Thought you'd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks 'You're just like Trump!'\"\n\nMusk continued, \"Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no one believes you anymore. You lost your credibility a long time ago.\" To another journalist, who wrote that \"blaming the messenger is the hot new thing everyone's doing,\" Musk replied, \"Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he's above criticism.\"\n\n\"Try being truthful & the public will believe you again,\" Musk said.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Despite his presence, administration officials confirm that Pence is voluntarily maintaining a distance from others due to precautionary measures.\n\nPence has tested negative for COVID-19 since his exposure. Notably, President Trump's personal valet and Vice President Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, have also tested positive for the virus. The President has had contact with both individuals within the past week.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy's top admiral and three key members of the Coronavirus Task Force are self-isolating or working from home following potential exposure to COVID-19. These individuals include Dr. Anthony Fauci, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, and FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn.\n\nOn ABC's \"This Week\" program, Lawrence Alan Kudlow, director of the United States National Economic Council, was asked about potential measures for White House staffers. Kudlow replied, \"We will take the advice of the White House medical unit, which is the best in the business. There may be [precautions]. I do not want to rule anything in or rule anything out.\"\n\nSenior White House Adviser Kevin Hassett admitted, \"It is scary to go to work. You know, it's a small, crowded place. It's, you know, it's a little bit risky. But you have to do it because you have to serve your country.\"\n\nNew White House guidelines include testing anyone who sees the president, increasing the use of masks, and more rigorous screening of anyone who enters the White House grounds. Chief of Staff Mark Meadows asserts that enough is being done to protect the president, stating, \"I can tell you, this is probably the safest place that you can come to.\"\n\nThe White House has already implemented daily Coronavirus tests for the president, vice president, and those closest to Trump. After Pence's press secretary tested positive, President Trump expressed that he was \"not worried\" about the virus spreading in the White House.",
    " Title: Trump Withdraws U.S. from Trans-Pacific Partnership, Signs Executive Orders on Trade, Taxes, and Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday, formally withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal. The TPP involved the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, but Congress had not ratified the agreement despite strong support from business groups and former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe withdrawal puts Capitol Hill and foreign governments on notice that the president will demand better deals on a one-on-one basis. Trump declared that the move was a \"great thing for the American worker.\"\n\nTrump's populist stance on trade has shaken up alliances in Washington. He received applause from union leaders during a meeting at the White House, but prominent Republican lawmakers have vowed to defend their party's traditional support for open markets and free trade.\n\nIn addition to the TPP withdrawal, Trump signed executive orders freezing nonmilitary federal hiring and reinstating the Mexico City Policy, which limits federal funding for abortions abroad. The abortion rule has been routinely adopted by Republican administrations and canceled by Democratic administrations since President Reagan enacted it in 1984.\n\nTrump's actions on the TPP and the Mexico City Policy have received mixed reactions. While some, such as Senator Bernie Sanders, have applauded the TPP withdrawal, others, like Senator John McCain, have criticized it as a \"serious mistake\" that will have lasting consequences for the U.S. economy and strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn the coming days, Trump is expected to sign an executive order to begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. Trump has blamed NAFTA for the massive exodus of manufacturing jobs from the U.S. since it went into effect in 1994.\n\nAt a breakfast meeting with business executives, Trump said he wanted American firms to \"make our products here again.\" He plans to reduce corporate tax rates from the current 35 percent to as low as 15 percent, but he said rolling back federal regulations that impede business growth would have a bigger impact. Trump also plans to cut income taxes for middle-class families.\n\nSeated around the conference table were the top executives from Dell Technologies, Ford Motor Co., Lockheed Martin Corp., Dow Chemical Co., Under Armour Inc., Whirlpool Corp., Johnson & Johnson, U.S. Steel Corp., SpaceX, International Paper, and Corning Inc.",
    " Title: GOP's Potential Divide on Susan Rice's Secretary of State Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe potential nomination of Susan Rice as the next U.S. Secretary of State could lead to a public confrontation between President Barack Obama and his 2008 election opponent, John McCain. However, the Republican Party's unity in opposing Rice's nomination remains uncertain.\n\nIf Obama decides to nominate Rice, a close friend and the current U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, it could create a significant showdown between the president and McCain, who has been the most vocal critic of Rice within the GOP and has pledged to block her nomination.\n\nThe crux of McCain's criticism revolves around Rice's role in the aftermath of the September 11 Benghazi attack, which resulted in the death of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans. In the days following the attack, Rice, as the public face of the White House's response, communicated a preliminary assessment that the incident was a spontaneous response to a demonstration.\n\nMcCain argues that Rice either showed incompetence by sticking to the CIA-approved talking points for several days or was engaged in a willful cover-up. In response, McCain has vowed to do everything in his power to block Rice's nomination and suggested that no Clinton replacement at State should be approved until the full details of the Benghazi attack are known.\n\nHowever, McCain's efforts to rally the Republican Party against Rice seem to be meeting resistance. Notably, McCain's closest Senate ally, Lindsey Graham, declined to join in threatening to filibuster Rice during a recent interview, stating that he would wait to hear Rice's explanation before making a decision.\n\nOther Republican senators, such as Marco Rubio and Joe Lieberman, have also expressed reluctance to pre-judge Rice's nomination. This suggests that, should Rice be nominated, a filibuster might not be the outcome, as was the case with Condoleezza Rice's secretary of state nomination eight years ago.\n\nIn conclusion, while John McCain is vocal in his opposition to Susan Rice's potential nomination, the Republican Party's unity in blocking her nomination remains uncertain. The outcome of Rice's nomination process could mirror Condoleezza Rice's nomination eight years ago, with the opposition party making noise but not actually filibustering.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Rules President Trump Cannot Block Twitter Users for Political Views\n\nArticle:\n\nA U.S. district judge has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users for their political views, citing a violation of the First Amendment. The ruling was made by U.S. district judge Naomi Reice Buchwald on Wednesday.\n\nIn her decision, Judge Buchwald wrote, \"We then proceed to the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment claims. We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account\u2014the \u2018interactive space\u2019 where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President\u2019s tweets\u2014are properly analyzed under the \u2018public forum\u2019 doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe judge further stated, \"We reject the defendants\u2019 contentions that the First Amendment does not apply in this case and that the President\u2019s personal First Amendment interests supersede those of plaintiffs.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in July 2017 by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York, along with seven individual Twitter users, against President Trump.

    " Title: GOP Struggles to Break Away from Fox News' Influence After 2012 Election Loss\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the 2012 presidential election, some Republican strategists have pledged to distance themselves from Fox News, aiming to address the party's perceived reliance on the right-wing news channel. This self-proclaimed \"grand experiment\" of aligning a political movement with a cable news network was deemed a failure in 2012, but there is little indication that enough Republicans will have the courage or desire to break free from Fox News' influence.\n\nThe network's hardline, conservative approach, which has garnered it several million viewers, was effective in catering to a dedicated, right-wing audience. Fox News is projected to generate over $1 billion in profits this year. However, in terms of supporting a national campaign and facilitating a nationwide conversation about the country's future, Fox News' performance this year was markedly poor.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, often found himself in trouble when he adopted Fox News' rhetoric, damaging his presidential prospects. Instances of this include misrepresenting facts surrounding the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, parroting the Fox talking point about the \"47 percent\" of voters who are lazy and shiftless, and Romney's puzzling embrace of reality TV show host-turned Fox News commentator Donald Trump.\n\nFox News viewers were not spared either. Throughout the year, they were fed a steady diet of misinformation about the candidates and were misled about the state of the race. This misinformation left Fox viewers disheartened on Election Night when Romney's supposed landslide failed to materialize.\n\nThe coverage of the campaign by Fox News has been widely criticized as an editorial and political fiasco. The coverage failed to sway the election in favor of the Republican candidate and remained detached from campaign reality for months at a time.\n\nFollowing another lopsided loss to President Obama, Republican strategist Mike Murphy urged Republicans to adopt a view of America that is not derived from \"Rush Limbaugh's dream journal.\" The Fox News dream journal bears a striking resemblance to Limbaugh's.\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle columnist Jon Carroll questioned whether Romney's defeat marked the end of the Fox News era, suggesting that the Fox model may have reached its limits in terms of ratings and electoral success.\n\nConservatives should have considered the long-term implications of handing control of a political movement to figures like Roger Ailes and his misinformation machine. They should have thought twice about allowing irresponsible media outlets like Fox News to supersede leadership within the Republican Party.\n\nAs Fox News became the de facto leader of the Republican Party, the driving electoral force, and with Ailes entrenched in his kingmaker role, candidates had to court Fox News in search of votes and the channel's coveted free airtime. The Republican Establishment is synonymous with figures like Rush Limbaugh, Roger Ailes, Karl Rove, and their media products, from Hannity to Levin.\n\nNew York magazine labeled Ailes \"the head of the Republican Party.\" This is why a GOP source told the magazine, \"You can't run for the Republican nomination without talking to Roger. Every single candidate has consulted with Roger.\"\n\nThis meant that campaigns were forced to become part of the channel's culture of personal destruction and to wrap themselves in Fox News' signature self-pity. Candidates, including Mitt Romney, often adopted the right-wing narrative that the conspiratorial press was out to sabotage their campaigns.\n\nThe right-wing bubble was a comfortable place to inhabit for those who viewed Obama as a historic monster or required constant reminders of this fact. The bubble was the place where followers were fed the feel-good GOP narrative about Obama's presidency being a disaster, that Americans suffered from 2008 buyer's remorse, and that the president's re-election defeat was all but pre-ordained.\n\nThe one-part-panic, one-part-denial message may have appealed to obsessive Obama-haters, but it did not prepare conservatives for the reality of the campaign season. And it cost the GOP a lost year in the Fox News bubble.",
    " Title: U.S. and Mexico to Hold Talks Amid Threat of Tariffs and Border Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nTop officials from the United States and Mexico will commence negotiations on Monday in an attempt to avoid President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports from Mexico and address the influx of migrants at the border. The president is currently in London for a pre-planned overseas trip, leaving others to address a potential trade crisis.\n\nThe extent of what Mexico can do, and what will be considered sufficient, to appease the president remains unclear. Trump's Republican allies have warned that tariffs on Mexican imports could negatively impact U.S. consumers and the economy.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Trump taunted negotiators for a swift resolution, stating, \"Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border. Problem is, they\u2019ve been \u2018talking\u2019 for 25 years. We want action, not talk.\"\n\nOn Monday, Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez will engage in talks with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Two days later, delegations led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will also meet in Washington.\n\nTrump has issued similar high-stakes threats in the past, only to back off at critical moments. However, a top White House official warned that the president is \"deadly serious\" about the tariffs. Trump has threatened 5% tariffs on Mexican imports starting June 3.\n\nThe president claims Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades but that the abuse will end with the imposition of tariffs on Mexican imports. His frustration with the flow of migrants is not new, but it is a subject he often revisits, as he did last week after special counsel Robert Mueller's rare public statement on the Trump-Russia report.\n\nThe tariff threat comes as the administration has been pushing for the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which aims to update the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some Republicans have expressed concern that the tariffs could derail that effort.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana called the tariffs a \"mistake\" and said it was unlikely Trump would impose them. Republicans on Capitol Hill and GOP allies in the business community have expressed serious unease with the tariffs. Some see this latest threat as a negotiating tactic and doubt Trump will follow through. Earlier this year, Trump threatened to seal the border with Mexico only to change course.\n\nThe president \"has been known to play with fire, but not live hand grenades,\" Kennedy said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"It's going to tank the American economy,\" he said. \"I don't think the president's going to impose these tariffs.\"\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly tried to dissuade Trump from trade wars and have questioned the White House's ability to rely on executive authorities to impose some of the tariffs as national security issues. At the same time, Trump's efforts to revamp immigration laws have garnered little support in Congress.\n\n\"I think what the president said, what the White House has made clear, is we need a vast reduction in the numbers crossing,\" Kevin McAleenan, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, suggested that Mexico could take several steps to decrease the record numbers of migrants at the border. He proposed that the Mexican government could seal its southern border with Guatemala, crack down on domestic terrorist organizations, and make Mexico a safe place for migrants seeking to apply for asylum.\n\nEconomists and business groups have raised alarms over the tariffs, warning that they will impair trade and increase the costs of many Mexican goods that Americans have come to rely on. However, Mulvaney downplayed those concerns, stating, \"American consumers will not pay for the burden of these tariffs.\"\n\nHe also suggested that the tariffs were an immigration issue, separate from the trade deal the United States is trying to negotiate with Mexico and Canada. Several top GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns that Trump's tariff threat could upend that deal. The chairman of the Finance Committee, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, said last week the tariffs would \"seriously jeopardize\" passage of that agreement, which needs approval in Congress.",
    " Title: U.S. Drone Shot Down in Yemen, Missile Fired at American Drone in Gulf of Oman Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of recent events, a U.S. MQ9 Reaper drone was fired upon by Iranian forces on Thursday, following the alleged Iranian attack on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. This incident occurred after a distress call from the MV Altair tanker, a Marshall Islands-flagged but Norwegian-owned crude oil tanker, at 6:12am local time. The drone arrived eight minutes later, but a missile, believed to be a modified SA-7, was fired at it at 6:45am local time, missing the drone.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the first distress call from the MV Altair tanker went out at 6:12am local time. The unmanned MQ9 Reaper drone arrived eight minutes later. At 6:45am local time, a missile was fired at the drone, but missed. The U.S. military stated that the missile was fired from Iran's mainland. The drone was fired upon after it arrived on station to assist the Norwegian tanker.\n\nIn addition, U.S. officials reported that a U.S. MQ9 drone was shot down in Yemen by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in recent days.\n\nThese events come amid heightened tensions in the region following the attack on oil tankers, which has put the U.S. and Iran on the brink of a direct conflict. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for the \"blatant assault\" on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman earlier Thursday.\n\nPompeo stated, \"This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.\"\n\nPresident Trump stated on \"Fox and Friends\" Friday morning that the attack had \"Iran written all over it.\" He added, \"Iran is a nation of terror and they've changed a lot since I've been president, I can tell you.\"\n\nU.S. officials released a video on Friday, allegedly showing Iran's Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded limpet mine from one of the vessels. The black-and-white footage, as well as still photos released by the U.S. military's Central Command on Friday, appeared to show the limpet mine on the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, before a Revolutionary Guard patrol boat pulled alongside the ship and removed the mine, Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban said.",
    " Title: Congressional Democrats Coalesce Around Biden Ahead of Texas Campaign Tour\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, who switched his support from Julian Castro to Joe Biden in September, has been leading a quiet effort to rally the Congressional Hispanic Caucus behind Biden's candidacy. This move comes as the Biden campaign has announced endorsements from a group of former Castro supporters in Texas since Castro endorsed Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe list of endorsements includes state representatives Rafael Anchia, Ryan Guillen, Eddie Lucio III, Oscar Longoria, and Armando Martinez. Previously, Biden's team announced the support of former San Antonio Mayor Phil Hardberger, state Sen. Jose Menendez, state representatives Rhetta Bowers and Garnet Coleman, and Dallas County Clerk John Warren. He also has the support of Texas representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Filemon Vela.\n\nBiden, who currently has the most endorsements from black and Hispanic members of Congress and congressional Democrats overall, is expected to campaign in Texas this week with fundraisers scheduled in Dallas and Houston. According to a CNN poll in December, Biden garnered 35 percent support in Texas, 20 points ahead of Bernie Sanders, his nearest competitor.\n\nRepresentative Colin Allred, a Democrat from a battleground district, recently endorsed Biden, joining a growing number of moderate Democrats who are backing the former vice president. Allred compared Biden's appeal to that of former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, stating that they also had the ability to win over disaffected Republicans and independents while also turning out the Democratic base.\n\n\"I know that Joe Biden is very popular in my district, and he will certainly win my district in 2020, and I think that that's probably the case across the country,\" Allred said, explaining why other moderate Democrats are getting behind the former vice president. This endorsement comes as vulnerable House Democrats are reportedly coalescing around Biden amid fears that a more liberal nominee could cost them their seats.",
    " Title: Founding Fathers' Warnings on Partisan Outrage Resonate in Modern Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Founding Fathers, in their warnings about the emergence of political parties, have found a modern echo in the current political landscape. George Washington, one of the Founding Fathers, referred to political parties as \"factions,\" a term pronounced with disdain. In his writings, Washington expressed concerns about the wrangling of political parties, which he believed would agitate the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms.\n\nThomas Jefferson, another Founding Father, shared similar sentiments, stating that he would not go to heaven with a party if he could not. The modern political scene, with its partisan divisions, mirrors the concerns expressed by these historical figures.\n\nThe article notes that political parties have become conglomerates of factions, each with a narrow focus on issues that cater to their specific interests. One such faction is made up of feminists, gays, and blacks, while another is a group of voters who prioritize issues such as religion, gun rights, and traditional values.\n\nThe article suggests that the problem arises when factions take over political parties, leading voters to confuse loyalty to faction and party interests with loyalty to the nation's interests. Elections, in this context, become a contest to determine which factions have gained control over which parties.\n\nThe article also discusses the dangers of electing a candidate solely based on their identity, citing examples such as the election of Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama, who were perceived as representing specific demographics. The article warns that such decisions can lead to unintended consequences, as was the case with Carter's presidency and the impact of Obama's election on race relations.\n\nThe article concludes by reiterating the Founding Fathers' original American ideology, which emphasized the subordination of narrow and selfish interests to the greater good. The article suggests that the current political landscape, with its focus on factions and self-interest, has strayed from this original ideology, leading to a breakdown in the political process and a search for the common good that has failed. The article warns that the nation may be on a path towards becoming a collection of self-interested factions, with the common good taking a backseat.",
    " Title: Second Round of ObamaCare Signups Begins Amid Improved Shopper Experience and Legal Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second round of ObamaCare signups commences this Saturday, with a goal of enrolling 3 million Americans and re-enrolling the approximately 7 million individuals who enrolled during the fall of 2013. This enrollment period, which concludes on February 15, is expected to offer an improved shopping experience for consumers, but it faces challenges from Capitol Hill and federal court.\n\nPresident Obama and top administration officials have set a target of enrolling 9.1 million people in 2015, marking a 28% increase from the previous year. This round will see 77 new health insurance providers participating, a sign that they view the marketplaces as a business opportunity.\n\nThe first enrollment period was marred by technical issues, with federal and some state-run ObamaCare websites crashing, failing to fully register some customers, and providing incorrect information. These problems were largely resolved within several weeks, and federal officials have stated that the federal site is now improved and ready for the new enrollment period.\n\nHowever, the Affordable Care Act continues to face opposition, with 56% of Americans in a recent Associated Press-GfK poll stating they would prefer to repeal the law completely, compared to 41% who would implement it as written. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is reportedly planning hearings and investigations during the lame-duck congressional session on issues such as premium increases and the law's impact on the federal deficit.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge on the law's tax credits, which make premiums affordable for millions. The court is not expected to hear the case until the spring, after the 2015 open enrollment period is over.\n\nWebsite outages are a possibility during this year's enrollment period, but a full-scale meltdown seems less likely. HealthCare.gov has been revamped to handle peak loads and beyond, and will serve as the online portal for coverage in 37 states, while the remaining states run their own insurance exchanges. Consumers can also apply in person or through call centers.\n\nThe pool of potential customers is estimated to be 23 to 27 million people who do not have access to affordable coverage on the job. For most newcomers, the online application process has been simplified, with the number of computer screens reduced from 76 to 16. Navigation is easier, and window shopping is available without first having to create an account.\n\nPremiums for 2015 are a wild card, with the average increase expected to be modest. However, prices can vary dramatically from state to state, even within regions of a state. Many returning customers could face premium increases if they do not shop around.\n\nThe administration is seeking to lower expectations, with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell's target being a total enrollment of 9.1 million people in 2015. This sign-up period will be the first time that renewal has been tried for current customers, and it also overlaps for the first time with tax-filing season.\n\nFor those already signed up, coverage will renew automatically if they do nothing, but this may not produce the best result. Returning customers could miss out on lower-premium options and get stuck with outdated and possibly incorrect subsidies. In most cases, they have until December 15 to update their income information or switch insurance plans, in order to have the changes take effect on January 1.\n\nThe tax issues will emerge during next year's filing season. Current customers who received tax credits this year will have to file new tax forms to prove they received the correct amount. Too much subsidy, and their tax refunds will be reduced. Too little, and the government will pay them.\n\nPeople who remain uninsured risk a penalty that will be deducted from their tax refunds. Millions may qualify for waivers, but getting exemptions could involve a paperwork ordeal. Community-based counselors helping uninsured people report strong interest, but they express concerns about this year's abbreviated sign-up season.",
    " Title: Former Vice President Dick Cheney Warns of North Korean Crisis to GOP Lawmakers\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney, in a meeting with GOP lawmakers on Tuesday, offered a blunt assessment of the ongoing crisis in the Korean peninsula, stating, \"We're in deep doo doo.\" The concern stems from the unpredictable and potentially unstable North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe situation in North Korea has become a matter of global concern, with the United States and its allies closely monitoring the region. According to recent U.S. intelligence, North Korea is believed to have completed preparations for mobile ballistic missile launches, and these missiles are reportedly ready for launch.\n\nThe Obama administration has indicated that a North Korean missile test could occur at any time. U.S. satellites are monitoring the Korean peninsula, and missile defense systems have been deployed in Japan and around Tokyo. Some Chinese tour groups have also canceled visits to North Korea.\n\nAdmiral Samuel J. Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, has characterized the crisis as a \"clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability.\" The volatile situation has left many wondering about North Korea's next move, as Kim Jong Un seems to have few options that do not involve a missile launch.\n\nThe potential for a military response from the United States remains a possibility, should North Korea proceed with a missile launch. The response would need to be forceful and unequivocal, sending a clear message that the U.S. is not playing games and means business.\n\nThe situation in North Korea remains a pressing concern for those living in areas within range of potential missile launches, including the West Coast of the United States. The crisis continues to unfold, and the world awaits Kim Jong Un's next move.",
    " Title: The Evolution of the Civil Rights Movement: A Reflection on the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nFifty years after the historic March on Washington, the contemporary civil rights movement faces criticism for its perceived shift from a grassroots, justice-focused movement to a politically-motivated, fundraising entity. The article, written by an unnamed author, argues that the modern civil rights movement, in part due to its success in dismantling segregation, has become preoccupied with imagined slights and manufactured controversies, rather than addressing the welfare of real people.\n\nThe author compares the two eras, highlighting the stark contrast between the challenges faced by Martin Luther King Jr. and the current state of the movement. King, who faced physical threats and violations of civil liberties, is contrasted with Al Sharpton, whose career is described as a catalog of the ridiculous and outrageous in pursuit of media attention.\n\nThe article notes King's profound engagement with biblical prophets and Reinhold Niebuhr, and his belief that \"unearned suffering is redemptive.\" In contrast, Sharpton's career is marked by incidents such as falsely accusing a man of rape and denouncing a Jewish businessman as a \"white interloper.\"\n\nThe author argues that the fight against segregation has been won, but the contemporary civil rights establishment struggles to acknowledge this. They suggest that cultural breakdown, rather than officially sanctioned discrimination, is a significant factor in the struggles of black Americans.\n\nThe article concludes by criticizing the contemporary civil rights establishment for using the charge of racism to shut down argument and deflect uncomfortable conversations, rather than fostering dialogue and progress. The author suggests that the modern movement is a testament to the legacy of the great movement's degeneration, rather than a continuation of its ideals.",
    " Title: Kerry Emerges as Frontrunner for Secretary of State Position\n\nArticle:\n\nWith John Kerry reportedly being the only serious candidate for the Secretary of State position, following the withdrawal of Susan Rice, the appointment of Kerry is the \"working presumption\" according to a senior State Department official. However, White House officials have stated that the decision is not finalized, as the current lineup, which includes Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and Michael J. Morell as the permanent C.I.A. director, is perceived as reminiscent of past national security teams.\n\nIf appointed, John Kerry would be the first white man to serve as Secretary of State since Warren Christopher in early 1997. His predecessors include Madeleine K. Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Hillary Clinton. Kerry's colleagues in the Senate have expressed confidence in his ability to pass through confirmation hearings, with Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, already referring to him as \"Mr. Secretary.\"\n\nThe composition of President Obama's team has come under renewed scrutiny following Rice's withdrawal. If she remains as the ambassador to the United Nations, she will continue to be part of Obama's cabinet and national security team. Rice is also considered a potential successor to Thomas E. Donilon as national security adviser. However, Donilon is not expected to leave his post for a year or two, unless he is named White House chief of staff.\n\nMich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense for policy, is still a candidate for the first female Defense Secretary. However, internal discussions suggest that the challenge of the next few years, which includes working with Congress to reduce the defense budget and eliminate major cold war-era weapons systems, requires a candidate like Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, who is seen as better able to win votes from his former colleagues.\n\nFlournoy has also been mentioned as a possible C.I.A. director, but Michael Morell, who ran the analysis division of the agency, is the favorite of C.I.A. officials. John Brennan, a close aide to Obama and a former agency station chief in Saudi Arabia who has directed counterterrorism activity from his basement White House office, is also a candidate for C.I.A. director. However, officials note that his current post already gives him sway over all 18 intelligence agencies.\n\nJohn Kerry has worked hard to strengthen his relationship with President Obama. Although Obama has at times considered Kerry long-winded and a throwback to a previous generation of diplomats, aides said, Kerry impressed Obama and Donilon when he was sent to deal with Hamid Karzai, the unpredictable president of Afghanistan, after Karzai's supporters rigged a presidential election in 2009 and refused a second round of voting.\n\nKerry also visited Pakistan several times to ease recurrent tensions, including a two-week visit after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials tried to get Kerry to write what they called a \"blood oath\" that the United States would never take action to seize Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. Kerry found a diplomatic way out, saying the United States had no \"designs\" on Pakistan's weapons.",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign's Internal Strategy Documents Reveal Friendly Relationships with U.S. Media and Manipulation Strategies\n\nArticle:\n\nInternal strategy documents and emails among Hillary Clinton's campaign staff have shed light on friendly and highly useful relationships between the campaign and various members of the U.S. media, as well as the campaign's strategies for manipulating those relationships. The documents were provided to a source identifying himself as Guccifer 2.0, who was reportedly responsible for prior significant hacks, including one that targeted the Democratic National Committee and resulted in the resignations of its top four officials.\n\nOn Friday, Obama administration officials claimed that Russia's \"senior-most officials\" were responsible for that hack and others, although they provided no evidence for that assertion. As these internal documents demonstrate, a central component of the Clinton campaign strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the campaign wants circulated.\n\nAt times, Clinton's campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be quoted \"on background\" and what should be described as \"on the record.\" A January 2015 strategy document\u2014designed to plant stories on Clinton's decision-making process about whether to run for president\u2014singled out reporter Maggie Haberman, then of Politico, now covering the election for the New York Times, as a \"friendly journalist\" who has \"teed up\" stories for them in the past and \"never disappointed\" them.\n\nNick Merrill, the campaign press secretary, produced the memo, according to the document metadata. That strategy document plotted how Clinton aides could induce Haberman to write a story on the thoroughness and profound introspection involved in Clinton's decision-making process. The following month, when she was at the Times, Haberman published two stories on Clinton's vetting process; in this instance, Haberman's stories were more sophisticated, nuanced, and even somewhat more critical than what the Clinton memo envisioned. But they nonetheless accomplished the goal Clinton campaign aides wanted to fulfill of casting the appearance of transparency on Clinton's vetting process in a way that made clear she was moving carefully but inexorably toward a presidential run.\n\nGiven more than 24 hours to challenge the authenticity of these documents and respond, Merrill did not reply to our emails. Haberman declined to comment. Other documents listed those whom the campaign regarded as their most reliable \"surrogates\"\u2014such as CNN's Hilary Rosen and Donna Brazile, as well as Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden\u2014but then also listed operatives whom they believed were either good \"progressive helpers\" or more potentially friendly media figures who might be worth targeting with messaging. The metadata of the surrogate document shows the file was authored by Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director of the campaign.\n\nAs previously reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588, pundits regularly featured on cable news programs were paid by the Clinton campaign without any disclosure when they appeared; several of them are included on this \"surrogates\" list, including Stephanie Cutter and Maria Cardona.\n\nThe Clinton campaign likes to use glitzy, intimate, completely off-the-record parties between top campaign aides and leading media personalities. One of the most elaborately planned get-togethers was described in an April, 2015, memo\u2014produced, according to the document metadata, by deputy press secretary Jesse Ferguson\u2014to take place shortly before Clinton's official announcement of her candidacy. The event was an April 10 cocktail party for leading news figures and top-level Clinton staff at the Upper East Side home of Clinton strategist Joel Benenson, a fully off-the-record gathering designed to impart the campaign's messaging.\n\nA separate email chain between Clinton staff (one that was not among those provided by Guccifer 2.0 but appeared on the DCLeaks.com site earlier this week) contains plans for a separate off-the-record media get-together in May. Food and drinks were provided by the campaign for the journalists covering it, on the condition that nothing said would be reported to the public. Many of the enduring Clinton tactics for managing the press were created by the campaign before she even announced her candidacy. A March 13, 2015, memo from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook provides insight into some of the tactics employed by the campaign to shape coverage to their liking. In particular, Mook was concerned that because journalists were assigned to cover Clinton, they needed to be fed a constant stream of stories that the campaign liked. As he put it, a key strategy was to \"give reporters who must cover daily HRC news something to cover other than the unhelpful stories about the foundation, emails, etc.\"",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Straddles Delicate Line in Administration's Response to Anti-Racism Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence is attempting to inject a more conciliatory tone into the Trump administration's response to anti-racism protests, while maintaining a delicate balance that does not reveal a dissonance with President Donald Trump's \"law and order\" positioning.\n\nDuring a White House meeting with state attorneys general, police union representatives, and local sheriffs, Pence offered a refined version of Trump's stance that economic stability is the solution to racial injustice. However, he acknowledged that the economy alone cannot deliver racial justice.\n\nPence's ability to adapt to the times and modify his posture as needed is one of his defining characteristics, setting him apart from his defiant boss. This trait could potentially benefit the administration during this period of social unrest.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's hard-line comments, Pence has been engaging in quiet outreach to affected communities. For instance, he met privately with prominent black conservatives to solicit their thoughts on how the administration should proceed. This approach is emblematic of the challenge Republicans face as they grapple with Trump's incendiary rhetoric on race and the simultaneous desire to build a big-tent coalition.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Pence clung to a pro-police stance, aligning with the tough-on-crime platform he and Trump ran on. However, the killing of George Floyd has highlighted differences between the president's strategy and that of his deputy.\n\nPence's absence during Trump's visit to St. John's Episcopal Church, where the president waved a Bible in front of the historic house of worship that had been partly burned during riots, raised questions among White House officials and outside allies. Pence's decision to stay back at the White House was attributed to deference, as it was considered a presidential moment.\n\nThe differences between Trump's hard-line comments and Pence's quiet outreach to affected communities underscore the challenge Republicans face as they navigate Trump's incendiary rhetoric on race and the desire to build a broad coalition. This was further illustrated by the contrast between Trump's comments about former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Senator Mitt Romney's participation in a faith-based protest against police brutality.\n\nRev. Charles Harrison, a Pence ally, expressed concerns about the president's remarks regarding tone but is hoping to discuss race relations with Pence soon. Harrison, who worked closely with Pence during his time as Indiana governor, praised Pence's openness to conversations about race relations.",
    " Title: Nearly Half of U.S. COVID-19 Deaths Occur in Long-Term Care Facilities, According to Research\n\nArticle:\n\nA new analysis of state-reported data by the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP) reveals that nearly half of all COVID-19 fatalities in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Across 39 states that report the location of COVID-19 deaths, 42 percent have occurred in nursing and residential care facilities.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 2.1 million Americans live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, which is 0.6 percent of the total population. The 42 percent figure may be undercounting nursing home deaths, as some states, such as New York, exclude from their nursing home death tallies those who die in a hospital, even if they were originally infected in an assisted living facility.\n\nResearchers at the International Long Term Care Policy Network, a global organization that shares research and best practices, found that 40.8 percent of reported COVID-19 fatalities across 18 countries took place in nursing homes.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to the high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes. Most residents of nursing homes are elderly or infirm, with many suffering from long-term ailments or weakened immune systems. People live close together, sharing living quarters and common spaces like cafeterias. There is also evidence that the coronavirus spreads more efficiently indoors.\n\nSome states made policy choices in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic that may have made nursing homes even more vulnerable to the disease. Governors in some states, including Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania, prevented nursing homes from turning away patients with active COVID-19 infections. These policies likely helped spread the disease to some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nOther states, like Florida, have locked down nursing homes and prioritized shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) to those facilities, putting them on the same level as hospitals. That may help explain why Florida has had fewer overall deaths than other large states\u2014despite 40 percent of those deaths occurring in nursing homes\u2014and it's something other states should copy.\n\nAs states emerge from total lockdowns and begin to restart their economies, policies must adapt to reflect the growing body of evidence about COVID-19 vulnerabilities. We now have a better idea about the overall fatality rate of the disease\u2014about 0.3 percent, lower than was feared at earlier stages in the crisis. We also know more about how the disease spreads and which populations need the most protection.\n\nAvik Roy, president of FREOPP, writes that the concentration of deaths in nursing homes should give younger, healthier Americans more confidence about returning to some semblance of normal life and should inform public policy decisions about how to slow the disease's spread. These data have implications for policy making as states look to safely reopen their economies.\n\nRoy states, \"The fact that nearly half of all COVID-19 deaths have occurred in long-term care facilities means that the 99.4 percent of the country that doesn't live in those places is roughly half as likely to die of the disease.\" This suggests that schools and many businesses can be reopened without the risk of huge spikes in hospitalizations or deaths, according to Roy, and that states must learn from their earlier missteps in handling nursing home outbreaks. These data have implications for policy making as states look to safely reopen their economies. The coronavirus is going to be a long-term problem, but the next step in fighting it is for governments to lift economically ruinous lockdowns when possible and focus on saving the lives most at risk.",
    " Title: Media Matters Pressures Advertisers to Withdraw Support from Fox News Host Sean Hannity\n\nArticle:\n\nLeft-wing activist group Media Matters is using allegations surrounding Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore as a means to pressure advertisers of Fox News host Sean Hannity. Moore is accused of making sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl while he was a 32-year-old attorney, in addition to pursuing romantic relationships with other teenage girls around the same time.\n\nMedia Matters is reportedly smearing Hannity to his sponsors, accusing him of defending child sex abuse. Hannity has explicitly stated that anyone guilty of what Moore is accused of doing has no place in politics.\n\nOver the weekend, Media Matters operatives pressured several advertisers into pulling their ads from Hannity's show. In one instance, Angelo Carusone, Media Matters' president, tagged a sponsor of Hannity's show while claiming that Hannity defends \"sexually preying on children.\"\n\nIn response to one such tweet from Carusone, coffee company Keurig announced that it would be pulling ads from Hannity's show. Another sponsor, Realtor.com, announced that it would not be running ads on Hannity in the future. 23andMe also stated that it is not currently running TV ads on Hannity.\n\nMedia Matters has been targeting Hannity's advertisers for months, launching a \"Stop Sean Hannity\" campaign in August. The group published a list of Hannity's sponsors and urged left-wingers to let advertisers know that they \"will get burned if they continue to associate with Hannity.\"\n\nPreviously, Media Matters targeted Hannity's advertisers in May after the Fox News host pushed a conspiracy theory surrounding murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich. That campaign caused several advertisers, including military insurance group USAA, to pull their ads from Hannity's show. Conservative activists responded by targeting the advertisers for MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and other liberal hosts. USAA eventually reinstated its advertisements on both MSNBC and Fox News.\n\nMedia Matters' effort to defund Hannity comes after they and other left-wing activists successfully pressured Fox News into firing Bill O'Reilly following sexual harassment allegations against the host.",

Bolton, and his associate deputy director Michael Duffey.\n\nSchumer stated that these individuals have direct knowledge about President Trump's decision-making regarding the withholding of aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"To conduct a trial without the facts is saying we are afraid. We have something to hide,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe two leaders are expected to meet \"soon\" to agree on rules and procedures for the trial, which is anticipated to begin next month.

    " Title: Kanye West Distances Himself from \"Blexit\" Campaign and Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nRapper Kanye West, who previously wore a MAGA cap and shared the stage with President Trump at the White House, has distanced himself from the \"Blexit\" campaign, a push to encourage black voters to leave the Democratic Party. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, West stated that he had no association with the \"Blexit\" campaign and that he was disassociating himself from politics.\n\nIn one tweet, West clarified that he had introduced Candace Owens, the black conservative promoting the \"Blexit\" campaign, to the person who designed the campaign's logo. However, the logo designer did not want their name associated with the campaign, so Owens used West's name instead.\n\n\"I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it,\" West tweeted.\n\nIn another tweet, West expressed his disillusionment with politics, stating, \"My eyes are now wide open and now realize I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative!\"\n\nWest had previously outlined a political platform on Twitter, expressing support for creating jobs, prison reform, common-sense gun laws, and accountability for those who misuse power. He also expressed compassion for people seeking asylum and parents fighting to protect their children from violence and war.\n\nWhile West's political platform did not seem MAGA-compliant on the surface, it is unavailable to determine whether this shift in stance is a result of his distancing from the \"Blexit\" campaign or a broader change in political beliefs.",

Police department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Johnson indicated he parked his car after feeling lightheaded. Officers checked on Johnson's well-being and did not observe any signs of impairment.\n\n\"There were no charges of intoxication, no information of intoxication as far as I know,\" Guglielmi said.\n\nGuglielmi says Johnson requested the investigation because he believes officers and the superintendent \"ought to be held to the highest standard.\"\n\n\"So what that means is they're going to interview the officers, they're going to look at all available evidence just to make sure that this is above-board and happened as described,\" Guglielmi said.\n\nThe 59-year-old Johnson underwent kidney transplant surgery in August 2017. His son Daniel was the donor.\n\nGuglielmi said Johnson visited a doctor earlier this week regarding a medication change. He said the superintendent on Wednesday expressed concerns about feeling exhausted. Guglielmi says Johnson visited a doctor Thursday to be evaluated on issues concerning his blood pressure.\n\nJohnson was hospitalized in June after doctors found a small blood clot in his lung during a stress test done as Johnson approached the two-year anniversary of his transplant. The clot was treated with medication and rest.\n\nJohnson was appointed superintendent in March 2016 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. His predecessor, Garry McCarthy, was fired days after the release of a video of the 2014 fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke. Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder last year and is serving a nearly seven-year prison sentence.",
    " Title: Time Magazine Names Pope Francis Person of the Year 2013\n\nArticle:\n\nTime magazine has named Pope Francis as its Person of the Year for 2013. This marks the third time a pope has received this honor, with Pope John Paul II being chosen in 1994 and Pope John XXIII in 1963. The Argentine pontiff, who was known as the \"slum cardinal\" for his visits to the poor and his preference for subway travel as archbishop of Buenos Aires, beat out other contenders such as former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and gay rights activist Edith Windsor for the award.\n\nThe selection was made by Time's editors, who considered suggestions from the magazine's more than 2 million Twitter followers. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi stated that Pope Francis, the first non-European pope in 1,300 years, the first from Latin America, and the first Jesuit, was not seeking fame.\n\nIn a statement, Lombardi said, \"It is a positive sign that one of the most prestigious recognitions by the international media has been given to a person who proclaims to the world spiritual, religious, and moral values and speaks out forcefully in favor of peace and greater justice.\"\n\nPope Francis's style is characterized by frugality. He shunned the spacious papal apartment in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace to live in a small suite in a Vatican guest house, and he prefers a Ford Focus to the traditional pope's Mercedes. A champion of the downtrodden, he visited the island of Lampedusa in southern Italy in July to pay tribute to hundreds of migrants who had died crossing the sea from North Africa.\n\nIn September, Francis gave a groundbreaking and frank interview, in which he said the Vatican must shake off an obsession with teachings on abortion, contraception, and homosexuality, and become more merciful. In July, Francis told reporters he was not in a position to judge homosexuals who are of good will and in search of God, marking a break from his predecessor, Benedict, who said homosexuality was an intrinsic disorder.\n\nWith the Catholic Church marred in recent years by sex abuse scandals, Francis formed a team of experts on Thursday to consider ways to improve the screening of priests, to protect minors, and to help victims. However, Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), a victim advocacy group, said in a statement Wednesday that more action was needed.\n\n\"After nine months of essentially ignoring the church's most severe crisis, (Pope Francis) hastily announced last week that he'll appoint an abuse study panel,\" Blaine said. \"He has not, however, made a single child safer.\"",
    " Title: Economic Impact of Federal Government Shutdown on National Park Communities\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing federal government shutdown, currently in its eighth day, is causing economic hardships for communities surrounding national parks, particularly those that rely on tourism. The small town of Terlingua, Texas, located near Big Bend National Park, is one such community.\n\nThe Big Bend Natural History Association, a nonprofit organization, estimates it will lose approximately $35,000 per week in sales from its bookstores in closed park buildings due to the shutdown. The Far Flung Outdoor Center, a local resort and outfitter, has reported a half dozen cancellations at its dozen cabins.\n\nGreg Henington, owner of the Far Flung resort and a local outfitter, stated, \"The uncertainty is what hurts us the most.\" While the overall economic impact of the shutdown is limited, communities dependent on national parks for economic activity are experiencing fewer visitors and less spending at area businesses such as hotels, restaurants, outfitters, and bookstores.\n\nThe National Parks Conservation Association estimates that, during this time of year, there are usually half a million visitors a day to the nation's 400 parks. This traffic generates roughly $18 million daily for nearby communities, from the Everglades in Florida to Yosemite in California, according to the nonprofit group.\n\nKathryn Petralia, co-founder of Kabbage, an online small business lender, noted, \"They need every dollar that comes in the door.\" Kabbage is providing loans to small- and medium-size businesses that may experience delays in obtaining Small Business Administration loans due to federal staffing cuts.\n\nNational Park Service officials did not respond to a request for comment, and SBA officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nIn Macon, Georgia, about 157,000 people a year visit the Ocmulgee National Monument Native American site and spend an estimated $9 million, according to the National Parks Conservation Association. However, with Macon's largest tourism attraction now closed, visitors unable to see artifacts including ancient ceremonial and burial mounds in the monument during a holiday lights show this month.\n\nGary Wheat, chief executive officer of Visit Macon, the city's tourism booster, stated, \"We see a lot of repeat travelers, but if you're not open, you risk losing those people from coming back.\"\n\nIn Port Angeles, Washington, near Olympic National Park, the main road to a winter play area called Hurricane Ridge has been closed since the federal shutdown due to a lack of staff to plow a mountain road. As a result, the Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area has remained closed during one of its busiest weeks of the year, costing about $5,000 a day in lost revenues and prompting the furlough of about 16 part-time workers.\n\nJohn Fox, like most of the other workers, relies on the ski area as a second job. \"It would be nice income for the holidays for everyone to have,\" said Mr. Fox, 33 years old, whose main job is as a ferry worker in Port Angeles. \"It's very disappointing, but it's definitely out of our hands.\"\n\nBig Bend National Park has also been disrupted during a seasonally busy time. Nearly 10% of the park's 440,000 annual visitors come in December when desert temperatures are mild. Although much of the park was initially kept open, officials closed the campgrounds \"due to sanitation and resource impact concerns,\" according to a notice on the park's website.\n\nOther national parks are experiencing a buildup of uncollected garbage and sewage. In an email last week, a National Park Service spokesman stated the agency would follow a contingency plan of closing areas if issues arise such as garbage buildup.\n\nMr. Henington, the outfitter, expressed concern that people will avoid Big Bend altogether if the federal shutdown continues. \"People will just think it's not worth going out there,\" he said.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Republican Primary Results Suggest Deep Divide Within GOP\n\nArticle:\n\nTed Cruz's victory in the Wisconsin Republican primary has solidified his position as the \"anti-Trump\" candidate in the presidential nomination race, according to analysts. Cruz beat Donald Trump by 13 points, securing 48 percent of the vote compared to Trump's 35 percent. However, Cruz's victory does not indicate unity within the Republican Party, as he claimed in his victory speech.\n\nThe analysis suggests that Cruz's win was largely due to anti-Trump sentiment rather than pro-Cruz support. More than half of Cruz's supporters, and two-thirds of Ohio Governor John Kasich's supporters, expressed fear of a Trump presidency, rejecting the leading candidate in the race.\n\nGovernor Kasich underperformed in Wisconsin with only 14 percent of the vote, but he remains adamant about taking his campaign to the convention as the only \"mainstream\" Republican still in the race. This has resulted in a split of the anti-Trump vote.\n\nIn the event of a general election between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, only 61 percent of GOP primary voters said they would vote for Trump, with 19 percent saying they would vote for a third-party candidate, 10 percent saying they would vote for Clinton, and 8 percent saying \"no one.\"\n\nIf it's Cruz vs. Clinton in November, only 66 percent of Wisconsin Republicans said they'd back Cruz, with 18 percent saying they'd vote third party, 6 percent saying Clinton, and 6 percent saying \"no one.\"\n\nThese numbers indicate a deep divide within the GOP between Trump supporters and Republican voters who oppose him. If Trump is not the nominee, many of his supporters say they will abandon the party altogether, especially if they believe Trump is treated unfairly at the convention.\n\nIn the event of a contested convention, if Trump arrives without a majority of the delegates, it becomes easier to deny him the nomination. However, denying Trump could potentially split the party, while not denying him could make him the face of the party.\n\nThe next test comes in two weeks with the New York primary, home turf for both Trump and Clinton, who, like Trump, needs to overcome an embarrassing defeat in Wisconsin. If either underperforms, it will be clear that Wisconsin was a turning point. Both will be damaged, but still on track to head to their respective conventions with the most delegates. The math, at this stage in the race, is almost impossible to overcome.",
    " Title: Deputy Attorney General Appoints Former FBI Director as Special Counsel for Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to oversee the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into any alleged collusion between the Trump 2016 campaign and the Russian government. In a press release on Wednesday, Rosenstein stated, \"In my capacity as acting Attorney General, I determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a Special Counsel to assume responsibility for this matter.\"\n\nRosenstein clarified that his decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted. He stated, \"What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.\"\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rosenstein emphasized the independence and integrity of the U.S. Department of Justice, stating, \"Each year, the career professionals of the U.S. Department of Justice conduct tens of thousands of criminal investigations and handle countless other matters without regard to partisan political considerations.\" He added, \"Considering the unique circumstances of this matter, however, I determined that a Special Counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome.\"\n\nRosenstein concluded, \"Our nation is grounded on the rule of law, and the public must be assured that government officials administer the law fairly. Special Counsel Mueller will have all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation, and I am confident that he will follow the facts, apply the law, and reach a just result.\"",

McInnes, who was already banned by various social media platforms, had nearly a quarter-million subscribers on his YouTube channel.\n\nIn August, Twitter suspended McInnes' account before a \"Unite the Right\" rally in Washington, D.C. At the end of October, Facebook and Twitter banned McInnes and Facebook groups affiliated with the Proud Boys, one day after the Daily Beast reported on McInnes' promotion of his infamous Oct. 12 speech at a New York Republican club, which ended with his Proud Boy followers brawling in the street with left-wing activists.\n\nTo promote his speech, which celebrated the decades-old murder of a Japanese socialist, McInnes posted pictures of himself on Instagram in racist \"Asian eyes\" glasses. In the aftermath of the event, McInnes\u2014who recently made his account private\u2014posted a picture of the Japanese assassination with a Nike slogan superimposed over it: \"Just do it.\"\n\nOn Saturday, The Blaze announced McInnes would not be working with them, although roughly one week before the outlet had announced he would be hosting a show. McInnes, who before becoming an alt-right darling was best known for co-founding Vice, was poised to host \"Get Off My Lawn,\" a show that was reportedly similar to his \"Get Off My Lawn\" podcast.\n\nIn mid-November, The Washington Post reported that a Washington state sheriff's office had issued a report saying the FBI considered the Proud Boys to be an extremist group. The office of Clark County Sheriff Chuck E. Atkins said in the report, \"The FBI categorizes the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism. The FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses.\"\n\nHowever, last week, The Oregonian reported that according to Oregon's top FBI agent, the FBI had not designated the Proud Boys as an extremist group. Special Agent in Charge Renn Cannon told reporters that the FBI never intended to designate the Proud Boys as an extremist group when it briefed Clark County law enforcement leaders about regional threats. Cannon stated, \"We do not intend and did not intend to designate the group as extremist... That was not our intention. That's not what we do. We will not open a case if someone belongs to antifa or even the Proud Boys. There has to be a credible allegation or a threat of violence before someone opens a case.\"",
    " Title: Theresa May Steps Down as Conservative Leader, Triggers Leadership Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nTheresa May, the United Kingdom's second female prime minister, has announced her resignation as Conservative leader, effectively ending her turbulent three-year premiership. In a speech at Downing Street, May expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve the country she loves, acknowledging her inability to deliver Brexit as a matter of deep regret.\n\nMay's announcement follows a meeting with Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench Tory 1922 Committee, who was prepared to trigger a second vote of no confidence in her leadership if she refused to resign. The prime minister will remain in Downing Street to shoulder the blame for expected poor results for her party in the upcoming European elections and to host U.S. President Donald Trump during his visit.\n\nThe Conservative Party will set out the terms for a leadership contest, with the process expected to begin on 10 June and last approximately six weeks. The timetable for the contest, as set out by the Conservative Party, is as follows:\n\n* Nominations closed on 10 June.\n* The first round of voting was held on Thursday 13 June.\n* Subsequent rounds have been pencilled in for the 18th, 19th, and 20th.\n* The postal vote element, when the approximately 140,000 Conservative party members will choose the country's new prime minister, will be completed in the week beginning Monday 22 July.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, is considered the frontrunner to be the next prime minister, with more than a dozen senior Tory figures considering entering the race. Rory Stewart, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, and Sajid Javid are among the likely contenders from the current cabinet.\n\nMay's departure comes after three years of wrangling with Brexiters on her own backbenches about the future relationship with the European Union. The loss of her majority at the 2017 general election, after a widely regarded disastrous campaign, also contributed to her difficulties.\n\nDamian Green, May's longtime friend and former first secretary of state, defended her record on Friday, stating that she was dealt an extremely difficult hand due to the seismic shock of the Brexit referendum and the subsequent loss of the Conservative Party's majority. Green also noted the increasing impatience and hostility towards the political class in the wake of the Brexit impasse.",
    " Title: Parallels Between Watergate Scandal and Hillary Email Investigation Draw Comparisons by Bob Woodward\n\nArticle:\n\nVeteran journalist Bob Woodward, who played a pivotal role in uncovering the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation, has drawn parallels between the Watergate scandal and the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices while she was Secretary of State.\n\nIn an interview, Woodward noted that the Clinton email controversy shares similarities with Nixon's prolonged battle over the White House tapes 40 years ago. Initially, Clinton seemed to be a strong contender for the Democratic nomination and the presidency. However, recent developments have sparked speculation about the viability of her candidacy and the possibility of her facing criminal charges for mishandling classified documents, a crime that has resulted in the prosecution of lesser-known individuals.\n\nWoodward, who was a staffer in the Nixon White House before, during, and after the Watergate scandal, highlighted several eerie similarities. In 1972, Nixon was poised for a landslide re-election, with foreign policy successes and a strong economy. However, the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office building and the subsequent investigation led to the unraveling of Nixon's presidency.\n\nIn the Watergate scandal, the Justice Department created a special prosecutor with subpoena powers, and numerous individuals from Nixon's staff were called to testify before Congress and behind closed doors with the special prosecutor. Investigative reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein published numerous stories detailing the investigation, including the existence of an Oval Office taping system that recorded the president's meetings.\n\nNixon refused to turn over the tapes, but the Supreme Court eventually ordered him to do so. The tapes revealed evidence implicating Nixon in the Watergate cover-up, leading to his resignation or the threat of impeachment and removal from office. Nixon never faced trial or jail time, but his presidency was effectively ended.\n\nWoodward posed questions about Clinton's actions, such as why she had a private email system and why she refused to turn over her emails in the first place. He also questioned whether Clinton, like Nixon, had something to hide and whether the missing emails could contain information about the Benghazi scandal or relationships between Clinton Foundation donors and her decisions at the State Department.\n\nThe Clinton administration has recently allowed inquiries into her emails, and she is now being investigated by three government agencies: the Justice Department, the State Department, and the Intelligence Community. The outcome of these investigations remains uncertain, but Woodward noted that once special prosecutors are appointed or congressional investigations begin, they often find evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe investigation into Clinton's emails could potentially present significant challenges for her presidential campaign, although it may not result in the earth-shattering consequences of Nixon's forced resignation in August 1974. The irony lies in the fact that one of the staff members on the Watergate Committee that investigated Nixon's files and tapes was a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham.",
    " Title: Orange County's Political Shift: From Republican Stronghold to Democratic Advantage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Orange County, California, was the most Republican county in the United States by raw numbers. The political landscape was dominated by the Republican Party, with Democrats being an afterthought. However, changes were beginning to emerge, as demonstrated by the victory of Democrat Loretta Sanchez over GOP firebrand \"B-1 Bob\" Dornan in the 1996 congressional election.\n\nThe county's Republican dominance was evident in the grand election night parties, often held at a posh hotel near John Wayne Airport. These events were attended by virtually every Republican elected official, as well as Democratic officials. The biggest tussles were between conservatives and the RINOs (Republicans in Name Only).\n\nOrange County was not just Republican, but it was the Republican Mecca. The county played a significant role in propelling political figures such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon into politics. However, as the county's defense-based economy and demographics changed, so did its politics.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton received more votes than Donald Trump in Orange County, marking a significant shift. The midterms saw a more pronounced change, with Democrats taking every congressional race and making serious gains in state legislative seats. The county's Republican Party, which had been operating as if nothing had changed, is now facing a significant challenge.\n\nThe shift in Orange County has far-reaching implications for the state as a whole. California Republicans counted on Orange County's overwhelmingly GOP vote totals to overcome their disadvantage elsewhere in statewide races. With Orange County's most Republican large county now evenly split, the question remains: Where will Republican votes come from to help balance Democratic strongholds elsewhere?\n\nThe recriminations are ongoing, with some blaming the president, immigration, or the party's leadership for the changes. Regardless of the cause, the GOP needs to face up to reality and come up with new strategies to stay relevant, or the death spiral will continue.\n\nAs of now, 27% of voters in Orange County are No Party Preference. Statewide, No Party Preference registrants have surpassed GOP voters. The number of registered Democrats has fallen by about 110,000 since the 2016 election, while the number of Republicans has dropped by about 340,000.\n\nThere is opportunity in these numbers. It's not as if California voters are in love with the Democrats. There are plenty of issues that Republicans can tap into, such as road congestion, a housing crisis, service cutbacks, crime hikes, poverty rates, and growing pension liabilities. However, the party's poor leadership and outdated thinking have gotten it nowhere.\n\nAt the state level, Republicans always get obliterated now. The two non-liberals who came closest to winning in the last election cycle both lacked the GOP label. These trends have been in the works for two decades, but OC's final flip from red to blue adds a punctuation point to California Republican decline. Perhaps the GOP can be heartened by an old Reagan quotation: \"The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.\"",

This decision has sparked controversy among conservatives, with some viewing it as a pragmatic move to provide affordable health insurance to Floridians, while others see it as a capitulation of principles.\n\nCharles Krauthammer, a conservative political commentator, discussed the situation on 'Special Report' last night, stating that \"it's honorable to take the money because people in [Florida] are paying federal taxes, are subsidizing people in other states.\" He further explained that it is a choice between providing health insurance to constituents and continuing the fight against Obamacare, suggesting that the law's passage through Congress, the President's signature, and the Supreme Court's approval make it difficult to repeal the law in the near future.\n\nGovernor Scott's decision to expand Medicaid comes after voters declined to elect a candidate who promised to repeal Obamacare in full during the 2016 election. This decision has led some to question whether Governor Scott's conservative credentials are being called into question, given his past efforts to repeal the law.\n\nSeveral other states with conservative governors, including Louisiana, Texas, and Wisconsin, have refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion program. The question remains whether Governor Scott's decision to accept federal funds for Medicaid expansion is a pragmatic move to provide health insurance to Floridians or a shift in political stance.",
    " Title: Trump's Proposed Involvement with Voice of America Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed displeasure with the media's coverage of his presidency, which has been marked by allegations of corruption, incompetence, and lies, among other issues. To counter this perceived negative portrayal, Trump has reportedly taken steps to limit his media consumption to conservative outlets like Fox News, and has been known to provide feedback to hosts on their segments.\n\nHowever, the president's efforts to control media coverage have extended beyond his personal media consumption. In an attempt to influence the narrative domestically, Trump has considered using the federal government's funding of Voice of America (VOA), a news organization with an annual budget of $218.5 million that broadcasts to 236.6 million people worldwide. VOA, which exclusively served foreign audiences until 2013, plays a role in shaping foreign perceptions of the United States and its leaders.\n\nIt is unclear if Trump is aware of VOA's role and mission, or if he views it as a means to disseminate propaganda about his administration. In January 2017, VOA's director, Amanda Bennett, stated that her team would \"absolutely\" not be \"manipulated by the Trump administration.\"\n\nThe use of federal funds for domestic media manipulation has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that such actions undermine the principles of a free press and the First Amendment. The White House has not provided further details on the proposed involvement with VOA.",

Charles Grassley (R-IA) had previously written a letter on June 30, 2015, expressing concern over the rapid approval of the transaction, which controlled nearly 25 percent of the country's uranium deposits.\n\nThe New York Times reported in April 2016 that the Clinton Foundation had ties to several investors involved in the Uranium One deal. The transaction, which resulted in the acquisition of U.S. based uranium assets by Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ), a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian government-owned company, raised national security concerns due to the foreign involvement.\n\nGrassley, in his letter, requested answers from the attorney general by July 16, 2016, on several questions, including the role of the Department of Justice in the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction, the personnel involved, and whether Secretary Clinton's relationship with the Clinton Foundation required her to recuse herself from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review of the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction.\n\nThe email traffic does not provide specific answers to these questions, but it does demonstrate the routine and intimate interaction between members of the campaign staff and the Clinton Foundation. It is unavailable whether the Department of Justice played a role in the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction, who the involved personnel were, or if Secretary Clinton recused herself from the CFIUS review.",

Trump also indicated he was considering pardons for lifestyle maven Martha Stewart and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, prompting criticism that the president is subverting the rule of law.\n\nD'Souza, who is an outspoken critic of former President Barack Obama, was sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to illegally reimbursing two \"straw donors\" who donated $10,000 each to the unsuccessful 2012 U.S. Senate campaign in New York of Wendy Long, a Republican he had known since attending Dartmouth College in the 1980s.\n\nTrump's decision to pardon D'Souza has sparked controversy, with some constitutional scholars, legal analysts, and Democratic lawmakers accusing Trump of undermining the rule of law with pardons based on political considerations. Critics argue that the president is sending a message to individuals caught up in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential collusion between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, including Trump's longtime private lawyer Michael Cohen, whose business dealings are separately under scrutiny in New York.\n\nTrump is also considering a pardon for Stewart, who was convicted in 2004 on charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and making false statements in an insider-trading probe. Trump also said he might commute the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat convicted of corruption charges.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley denied that celebrity was a consideration in whom the president decides to pardon. \"Look, there are plenty of people the president is looking at right now under the pardon process,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons, and Trump has used that authority to benefit convicted figures revered by some on the political right, such as former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio and Scooter Libby, the chief of staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nTrump pardoned Libby in April, and Arpaio in August 2017, less than a month after his conviction for criminal contempt in a case involving racial profiling of Hispanics. Arpaio was known for his crackdown on illegal immigrants in Arizona's Maricopa County.\n\nTrump also pardoned boxer Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight champion, last week, posthumously, who was jailed a century ago because of his relationship with a white woman.\n\nStewart and Blagojevich were both involved with Trump's \"Apprentice\" reality TV television show. Blagojevich was convicted of corruption offenses including soliciting bribes for appointment to the U.S. Senate seat Obama vacated after being elected president in 2008.",

Stephen D. Biddle, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, stated that both candidates tacitly agree to pretend that their policies can significantly impact the American economy, while in reality, they are both influenced by foreign events beyond their control.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's trip to Mexico for the Group of 20 leaders' gathering marks his third international summit meeting in a month. During his time in Los Cabos, he will discuss the financial crisis in Greece and meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, following accusations of Moscow supplying arms to Syria. Meanwhile, his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, will tour swing states during Obama's absence.\n\nThe president will also engage in talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program, with the aim of curbing Tehran's nuclear activities. Optimism over these talks has waned, giving way to fears of an impasse that could benefit Iran.\n\nForeign policy has not been a significant concern for American voters, with only 4% of respondents in the latest New York Times-CBS News poll citing it as their top election issue. Despite this, Mr. Romney has occasionally used foreign policy to criticize Mr. Obama, stating that he would \"just look at the things the president has done and do the opposite\" regarding Israel. On the CBS News program \"Face the Nation,\" Mr. Romney expressed a willingness to take military action against Iran if necessary.\n\nKristen Silverberg, a former State Department official under President George W. Bush who is advising Mr. Romney, criticized the Obama administration for its perceived lack of leadership, stating that it has \"sat out\" significant international events such as the Iran protests and the Syrian uprising.\n\nJamie M. Fly, executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative, a conservative group, expressed a growing sense that \"what is required is American leadership rather than the president's leading-from-behind foreign policy that has failed to address an imploding Syria, a nuclearizing Iran, an economic crisis in Europe, and a revanchist Russia.\"\n\nWhile foreign policy can present challenges, it also offers advantages for a president. Engaging in international diplomacy on Air Force One lends a statesmanlike stature, allowing the president to dismiss criticism as mere politics. In response to Mr. Romney's comments about Israel, Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, stated, \"Mitt Romney is yet again trying to score cheap political points by distorting President Obama's record of support for Israel.\"\n\nMr. Obama's foreign policy record, including the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the toppling of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's government in Libya, and robust action against terrorists, is often cited as an advantage. James M. Goldgeier, dean of American University's School of International Service, described Mr. Obama as the \"first real national security Democrat\" since President John F. Kennedy.\n\nNancy E. Soderberg, a national security aide and United Nations diplomat under President Bill Clinton, noted that it is \"par for the course\" for an incumbent to address international challenges while the challenger has a free ride. However, she also pointed out that the European economic crisis could negatively impact Mr. Obama's re-election efforts, stating, \"Europe's weakness is likely to blow back on Obama's efforts this fall\u2014just at the wrong time.\"",

    " Title: Thousands Protest U.S. Immigration Policies Across America, Call for Reunification of Separated Families\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across America to demonstrate against the nation's immigration policies and demand the reunification of parents and children who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to published reports. More than one week ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end the practice, but many families still remain separated as the government sorts through their cases.\n\nIn all, an estimated 600 protests were scheduled in cities spanning from New York City to Los Angeles. The marchers included open-border advocates as well as conservatives who say families should not be separated. The total number of protesters could rise to hundreds of thousands, according to some reports. Social media was flooded with photos of those participating and watching the demonstrations.\n\nIn New York City, protesters shouted \"Shut detention down,\" a reference to demonstrations held at ICE offices across the country. Barry Hooper of San Francisco told the Associated Press he attended the protest with his wife and two daughters to \"let the president know that this is not acceptable.\" Liliana, his 7-year-old daughter, held a sign she made that read, \"Stop the separation.\"\n\nProtesters in San Francisco carried flags and signs with slogans that read, \"Deport Trump,\" and \"I Really Care, Do You?\" \u2013 a jab at the words written across a jacket the first lady wore during a visit to an immigrant detention center. Amid a global furor over the immigrant crisis, Melania Trump wore a jacket with the words, \"I really don't care, do u?\" written across the back in large white letters. Trump later said the message on his wife's jacket was directed at the \"Fake News Media.\"\n\nCelebrities and politicians who oppose Trump were among those participating in a demonstration in Los Angeles, according to the Associated Press. California Democrats who turned out for the event included Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Migrant children taken from their parents will suffer lifelong trauma, Harris said.\n\nA rally near the city hall in Portland, Maine was so large that police shut down streets as a reported 2,000 people \"chanted, cheered and prayed,\" the wire service reported. In downtown Denver, an estimated 4,000 people attended a boisterous rally. Some of the protesters wore foil blankets, a symbol of similar blankets they gave to children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOthers carried signs that included the messages: \"Keep the kids, deport the racists\" and \"Break walls, build families.\" Elsewhere, smaller groups banded together in city parks and downtown squares in virtually every state. Some carried tiny white onesies with the words, \"What if it was your child?\" and \"No family jails,\" according to reports.\n\nThe rallies were funded by the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and The Leadership Conference, Fox News reported. Local organizers did most of the planning and coordination efforts. Many of them used informal networks that formed during the worldwide women's marches that happened on Trump's inauguration and its anniversary, the report stated.\n\nAs the protests were underway, Trump doubled-down on the immigration issue through a series of tweets, including:",
    " Title: \"Romney's Four-Year Tenure as Massachusetts Governor: A Look at His Collaborative Approach and Legislative Accomplishments\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the November elections, both President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney will highlight their differences. However, the two men's lives share striking similarities, particularly in their experiences as political executives. This article is part of NPR's \"Parallel Lives\" series, focusing on Mitt Romney's four-year tenure as governor of Massachusetts (2003-2007).\n\nDuring his time in office, Romney faced a Massachusetts Legislature that was 85% Democratic. He attempted to boost the number of Republicans during his first two years, but this effort was unsuccessful, as Republicans lost seats in the midterm elections. Frustrated, Romney shifted his focus, stating, \"From now on, it's me-me-me.\"\n\nWithin weeks, Romney unveiled a universal health insurance plan, which became his signature accomplishment as he launched a 2008 bid for the White House. Passing this bill required close collaboration with Democrats, and at its ceremonial signing at Boston's Faneuil Hall, Romney spoke as a political uniter.\n\nAt the bill's signing, Romney stood alongside Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009. The two men had debated sharply on the same stage in 1994 during Romney's unsuccessful bid to unseat Kennedy. However, in 2006, Kennedy had only praise for Romney, stating, \"To our governor, and to our Senate president and our speaker, we all say, 'Well done.'\"\n\nThomas Whalen, a Boston University political historian, suggests that passing the state's health care law pushed Romney outside his comfort zone. Whalen states, \"He was capable, you know, when he was willing to, to get down in the trenches, [to] cut deals, to pigeonhole legislators, to get his reform health care package through.\"\n\nApart from health care, Romney defined success not with big-picture legislative accomplishments but with confrontation. In a 2008 campaign ad, Romney boasted about taking on his Legislature, stating, \"I like vetoes; I vetoed hundreds of spending appropriations as governor.\" Romney issued some 800 vetoes, and the Legislature overrode nearly all of them, sometimes unanimously.\n\nAt a recent Obama re-election rally on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse, Democratic legislator Pat Haddad was heckled by Romney supporters. Haddad warned that if Romney is elected president, \"You're gonna get the same guy who never wanted to engage the Legislature. He never wanted to look for new jobs; he was always only looking for his next job.\"\n\nHowever, Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams argues that this is the kind of criticism one receives for shaking up the status quo. Williams states, \"Obviously, when you do that and make the tough decisions, you're not going to make friends everywhere.\"\n\nDemocrat Ellen Story, who served in the Legislature during Romney's tenure, recalls a governor who was aloof and not approachable. Story remembers Romney having a policeman screen visitors and not allowing lawmakers to use the bank of elevators just outside his office.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Senate Minority Leader Richard Tisei praises Romney for his handling of a $3 billion deficit, stating, \"He walked into a very difficult situation, and I think the fact that he was able to close the budget gap without increasing income or sales or any other broad-based tax, No. 1. And No. 2, he was able to control spending.\"\n\nAt the time, Tisei says, people in Massachusetts appreciated Romney's effort. However, this week, the Obama campaign released a new ad that aims to turn Romney's time as governor against him, stating that the state under Romney had \"one of the worst economic records in the country.\"\n\nBy the end of his term, Romney's approval rating in Massachusetts was only 34%. In recent polls, the number has barely changed. Political historian Whalen suggests that this is not surprising, stating, \"I think Romney's biggest problem here in Massachusetts is not that he necessarily did a disastrous job. He did not. But he raised the expectation bar so high that, you know, he just didn't deliver.\"\n\nThis critique is similar to the one often leveled against the president whom Romney seeks to unseat.",
    " Title: Romney's Foreign Policy Vision in Final Debate: A Tough Battle Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's advisers anticipate a challenging debate on foreign policy, which will take place on Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, as the focus on this issue is a strength for President Barack Obama. The Romney campaign views this debate as the last opportunity to significantly impact the election in the swing states that will determine the outcome.\n\nAccording to top advisers, Romney's chances of winning the debate are slim due to the electorate's perceived lack of interest in foreign affairs at present. The differences between the two candidates on key issues such as ending the Afghan war and the Syrian conflict are minimal, making it difficult to draw clear distinctions.\n\nPresident Obama has used the successful operation that led to the death of Osama bin Laden as a political advantage in debates and speeches, emphasizing strength and achievement. This strategy has been effective in demonstrating Obama's foreign policy successes.\n\nThe Romney campaign is hopeful that the candidate will not worsen his position in the debate, but they are not as confident about winning the race as they were before the first presidential debate. The debates have not significantly altered the race, according to Vin Weber, the Romney campaign's special adviser on policy. Weber stated, \"The candidates are close, and the economy is the Number One issue. Foreign policy is really important, but it is not driving this election.\"\n\nA top Republican official expressed a more straightforward view: \"I don't think there are a lot of soft voters who are waiting to hear a position on the Eurozone.\" This could be problematic for Romney, as another strong debate performance could be the deciding factor in his favor.\n\nThe two campaigns share a similar perspective on the state of the race as of this weekend: Obama currently holds a slight edge, particularly in the Midwest states of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ohio, which makes a Romney victory challenging. However, Romney is performing well in Florida, has a slight advantage in Colorado, and is near-even in Virginia, offering more hope than before the first debate.\n\nRomney's foreign policy has not been his strongest area throughout the campaign, from his assertion that Russia is the biggest strategic threat to the U.S., to his bumpy Europe trip, and ending with his politicized statement following the Libya killings and a clumsy exchange about that terrorist attack in the last debate.\n\nMatt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic-leaning think tank, commented, \"So far, Romney is batting zero when it comes to landing a punch on foreign policy or national security.\" Bennett added, \"He has whiffed in every single at-bat, and there's no evidence he can do any better when he's doing it for 90 minutes.\"",
    " Title: NATO's Evolution and Challenges: A Call for Tough Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), established in 1949, has faced increasing scrutiny and debate in recent years, with the latest controversy sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on the alliance's commitment to defend its newest member, Montenegro.\n\nThe essence of NATO lies in the principle of collective deterrence, where an attack against one member, as per Article V of the NATO charter, is considered an attack on all members. This mutual defense is the cornerstone of the alliance, deterring potential aggressors by demonstrating a strong, united front.\n\nHowever, the question arises: What happens when an alliance becomes so large and diverse that not all members share similar traditions, values, agendas, or national-security threats? The original European members of NATO, considered themselves kindred neighbors under the nuclear umbrella of the United States. With the inclusion of West Germany in 1955, NATO's mission was altered to not only keep the U.S. in and the Soviet Union out, but also to raise Germany up rather than keeping it down.\n\nNATO's collective defense was designed to offer breathing space against the superior forces of the Soviet Red Army, until the United States could bring in reinforcements or threaten to use its superior nuclear forces against would-be aggressors.\n\nAs the alliance has grown, it has become less a defensive military alliance and more a de facto cultural institution to homogenize Europe along Western lines. For some in Europe, NATO is envisioned not so much as a collection of planes and tanks, but instead as an expanded version of the European Union.\n\nThe more diverse NATO has become, the less unified it has become, especially with the demise of the original threat of the Soviet Union. As post-Cold War Europe grew calmer and more affluent, NATO members became less likely to believe that they would ever need to sacrifice to invest in their mutual defense.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Cold War, NATO was eager to enlist eager Eastern European and Balkan nations that rightly had feared Russia even after the end of the Soviet Union. However, southeastern Europe and the Balkans were also home to age-old feuds and surrogate wars between rival empires, from World War I to the Bosnian War in the early '90s.\n\nOne, vastly increasing its membership can only make NATO weaker, not stronger. In some sense, when everyone is in an alliance, no one really is. Vladimir Putin may gamble to find out whether affluent Dutch or Belgian youth will really be willing to die fighting for the territorial integrity of distant Bulgaria. If not, then Article V will be exposed as a farce, and NATO itself will be finished.\n\nIf Albania and Montenegro are in NATO, why not Austria, Finland, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, and Serbia? Will Mexico join Canada and the U.S. to round out the North American membership?\n\nTwo, the borders of the \"North Atlantic Treaty Organization\" are now ill-defined. Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Turkey is becoming an updated version of the old Islamic Ottoman caliphate. It is an enemy of the Kurds and Israel, both staunch U.S. allies. If Turkey gets into a \"defensive\" conflict with Israel, would young soldiers from Kansas want to risk death to \"defend\" an anti-American, authoritarian NATO theocracy from a pro-American liberal democracy?\n\nTough decisions, not more weary and sanctimonious rhetoric, are needed to revitalize NATO. The alliance must insist that all members quickly meet their military obligations of spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense. If a rich country in peace reneges on its promise of military readiness, why would anyone expect it to fulfill its pledge of assistance in wartime?\n\nNATO should insist on common values and agendas, and its members should formally identify their likely collective enemies. The alliance must ensure that any nation in NATO belongs in NATO\u2014and thus is worth risking what could become a nuclear war on its behalf.",
    " Title: The Ongoing Debate on Iran Nuclear Negotiations: A Closer Look at the Unmentioned Parallel Nuclear Weapons Program\n\n Article:\n\n The ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have been a subject of debate since the April Fool's Day 'framework' was announced in Lausanne, Switzerland, in late March 2015. The Obama administration, along with Secretary of State John Kerry and their advisors, have attempted to portray the contentious talks as a great success, despite contradictory statements from the European Union, France, Iran, and the U.S. regarding the agreed-upon terms.\n\n Amir Taheri, in a piece at the New York Post on April 4, 2015, referred to the diplomatic discussions as a \"diplomatic dog's dinner\" of competing and contradictory statements, suggesting that it is not a genuine agreement at all.\n\nIf we consider what is known about Iran's nuclear weapons program, it becomes apparent that the ongoing discussions about centrifuges, enrichment levels, inspection regimes, and sunset clauses are merely window dressing. The real Iranian nuclear weapons program is likely hidden behind a wall of secrecy, guarded by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS\u2014Iran's primary intelligence agency).\n\nIt is well-known that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered the IRGC to \"get the bomb\" in the waning days of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war. Details about the subsequent 25-year Iranian commitment to comply with that order are less well-known.\n\nAs the \"father of the Pakistani bomb,\" Abdul Qadir Khan, wrote in documents obtained by the Washington Post in 2010, Pakistan provided Iran with blueprints and parts for centrifuges and shared its secret list of worldwide suppliers. This is how the Iranian nuclear weapons program began. However, neither the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) nor the public knew anything about this until the Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), exposed Iran's program in August 2002.\n\nThe Iranian regime, a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), went into panic mode and came up with a plan to limit the damage. The Iran Lobby in America would play a key role in that damage control operation.\n\nMuch like the Iranians' mentors in the clandestine WMD business\u2014the Soviet KGB\u2014had done earlier when some of its illicit weapons programs made media headlines, the Iranians conceded a few of the sites that were now exposed: Natanz, Isfahan, Arak, and later Fordow. Lavizan-Shian, where the regime had worked on nuclear warhead design, was deemed too sensitive, so it was simply razed to the ground in 2003, and its components moved elsewhere.\n\nNatanz, the buried uranium enrichment site where some 9,000 centrifuges currently operate, became the centerpiece of the regime's new information operation. It was opened to IAEA inspections, figured prominently in the IAEA's quarterly reports, and was allowed on the P5+1 nuclear negotiations agenda.\n\nSimilarly, it was with Isfahan, the conversion plant; Arak, the heavy water reactor that gives Iran a parallel plutonium route to the bomb; and Fordow, a deeply buried centrifuge facility.\n\nEveryone has been kept busy arguing, discussing, and negotiating about the sites Iran got caught with\u2014and now, more recently, a non-existent 'agreement' that each of the parties describes in its own, mutually contradictory, terms. Indeed, all the negotiating teams from the IAEA, Britain, China, the European Union, France, Germany, Russia, and the U.S. are being kept so busy that nearly everyone has forgotten all about the fact that Iran's entire nuclear program was an illicit clandestine one until the NCRI exposed it\u2014or that virtually every site in that program that's now public was revealed by someone other than Iran.\n\nParchin, a military site where the IAEA believes Iran has conducted nuclear trigger explosives tests, provides a good example of how the regime deals with demands to open places to inspection it would rather remain closed: they just say \"no.\" And, as with Lavizan-Shian a dozen years earlier, they conduct a \"clean-up\" operation to tear down buildings and destroy parts of the complex they'd prefer not show up in any more satellite images.\n\nNaturally, Parchin has not been included in any of the P5+1 talks, nor has the U.S. delegation even suggested that it ought to be. It has been the same with other suspicious sites like Khondab and Lavizan-3, now revealed publicly, but left completely off the agenda. This is not to even consider how many additional clandestine sites Iran has been operating, but are as yet not revealed.\n\nThe critical issues before us then are not so much about the number of centrifuges, or which generation of centrifuges, or what level of enrichment will be allowed to Iran going forward at the showcase sites: rather, we must ask why and how our negotiators have themselves been spun up to dither endlessly, but only about sites already in the public domain. Iran's secret parallel nuclear weapons program remains unmentioned and untouched.\n\nIn Part 2 of this series, the critical role of the Iran Lobby will be examined.\n\nClare M. Lopez is the Vice President for Research & Analysis at the Center for Security Policy.",
    " Title: GOP Optimistic About Senate Primary Results, Predicting Closer Control of the Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nEstablishment Republicans are expressing optimism that the results of Tuesday's Senate primaries in Kentucky, Georgia, and Oregon will yield candidates favorable for defeating Democrats in November, potentially bringing the party one step closer to controlling the Senate.\n\nThe primary race in Kentucky, featuring a challenge to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, has garnered significant national attention. McConnell is predicted to secure a landslide victory over tea party candidate Matt Bevin, but the margin could be crucial in November. Recent polls indicate McConnell could win by 20-30 percent, according to The Washington Post. However, a substantial turnout for Bevin on Tuesday could signal a challenging general election for McConnell against Kentucky Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a self-described \"Bill Clinton Democrat.\"\n\nIn the Georgia primary to replace retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss, none of the five contenders are expected to secure the necessary 50 percent support to avoid a run-off in July between the top two vote-getters. Businessman David Perdue, who is making his first foray into public service, is currently polling up to 10 percent higher than Chamber of Commerce-backed Rep. Jack Kingston. Kingston is competing for second place with former secretary of state Karen Handel, a favorite of Sarah Palin, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIf Perdue becomes the nominee, the Post added, the odds of securing a victory in November could be against him, given that only seven sitting senators have never previously held elected office. However, the Democratic recruit, businesswoman Michelle Nunn, is a first-time candidate, and recent polls indicate Perdue currently leads Nunn in a potential match-up by single digits. Polls also show that a match-up between Nunn and Kingston puts Nunn ahead by an average of just 2.5 percent.\n\nIn Oregon, Republicans are closely monitoring the fortunes of pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby, who is facing state Rep. Jason Conger. Wehby has appeared poised for a sure victory, but a report alleging Wehby stalked an ex-boyfriend may have impacted her momentum heading into the final days. The extent to which the news may have affected her chances is unclear, particularly given that many Oregon voters vote by mail, the Post noted, predicting she will prevail. If she wins, Wehby would challenge Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who narrowly won in 2008.\n\nWhile a Republican has not been elected senator in Oregon in over 10 years, early polls indicate Wehby would be running neck-and-neck with Merkley, providing the GOP a credible chance to take the seat. One poll in April gave Wehby a 4-point lead, while another gave Merkely a 12-percent advantage.",
    " Title: Proposal for a Pre-Designed Randomized Clinical Trial in Response to Acute Infectious Disease Outbreaks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Ebola virus has made its way to the United States on several occasions, with at least two instances of its spread to healthcare workers. Given the extensive spread of Ebola in West Africa, more cases in travelers or healthcare workers would not be surprising. The disease has been known since the times of the plague, and unfortunately, more cases are expected.\n\nDespite the identification of Ebola and related viruses nearly 50 years ago, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the best therapies for people infected with the virus. In the midst of an epidemic, it is crucial to learn the most effective ways to quickly treat critically ill individuals, not only to stem the tide of disease in the United States but for the benefit of the global community.\n\nIn any epidemic, there are early cases and late cases. Learning from the early cases can help in making informed decisions when things get worse. Three years ago, cases of severe E. coli infections began to appear in Germany. By the end of the epidemic, hundreds had become ill, and at least 50 people died. However, by studying this large cluster of cases, much could have been learned about which treatments were optimal; instead, the epidemic ended with little knowledge about how to treat the next outbreak.\n\nThe reason for this lack of knowledge is that every doctor treated his or her patients according to their best individual judgment, given the information available to them. However, judgment varies, and treatment varies as a result, leading to different outcomes. Since so little was learned, when future E. coli outbreaks occur, we\u2014and our patients\u2014risk finding ourselves in the same sub-optimal position again. This is the current state of Ebola.\n\nThere is a solution to this problem. Medical research has advanced greatly through controlled clinical trials, in which ill persons are randomized to receive one treatment or another, and then outcomes are compared. From such randomized clinical trials has come the knowledge that has improved chemotherapy for nearly all cancers, as well as treatments for HIV infections. The randomized clinical trial minimizes the bias of personal judgment and permits a head-to-head comparison of whether treatment A or B is better.\n\nThat's what is needed for Ebola, and for the next epidemic\u2014whatever it is and whenever it comes, which it will. However, regulatory processes are slow and essentially too time-consuming to be able to establish a randomized clinical trial in real-time as an epidemic is unfolding. Therefore, the author proposes a modest solution:\n\nOur health authorities should pre-design a generic randomized clinical trial for acute infectious diseases. The trial design should be well-vetted, and blessed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and appropriate ethics committees. When a possible outbreak appears on the horizon, the President, via the Surgeon General, would be empowered to call a public emergency, and the pre-approved generic trial would be launched.\n\nAll that would need to be decided at that point is what treatment should constitute A and what should be B. For nailing down treatment approaches, a panel of known experts\u2014say in Ebola virus\u2014should be convened to provide their best judgments. When cases arrive, patients would be immediately offered the possibility of enrollment in the randomized clinical trial.\n\nSince the treatment choices would be the best available, presumably few would refuse, and as data is gathered over time, it would become clear which treatment is more effective, A or B. If it turns out to be B, the panel then asks: Is there a reasonable treatment C? The next trial would then compare B and C, and so on.\n\nThis approach would allow us to be continuously learning what works and what does not, and continuously improving treatment. Such a protocol would demonstrate an orderly approach to handling an epidemic, an approach that could be exported to other countries as well. And, of course, anticipation and order are important antidotes to fear.\n\nLet's start now, with Ebola, though rest assured that there will be another epidemic coming our way before too long. And another after that. Let's prepare.",
    " Title: EgyptAir Flight MS804: Debris Found, Search for Black Boxes Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nEgyptAir flight MS804, carrying 66 passengers and crew, disappeared from radar screens 230 minutes into a flight from Paris to Cairo on Thursday morning, local time. The aircraft was traveling at an altitude of 11,000 meters (37,000ft) and was 175 miles from the Egyptian coast when it vanished. Debris, including a \"body part,\" two seats, and suitcases, has been found in the Mediterranean Sea, according to Egyptian authorities.\n\nThe Airbus A320, which left Paris at 11.09pm on Wednesday (21.09 GMT/07.09am Thursday AEST), was scheduled to land at 3.29am Paris time but disappeared 45 minutes before landing and 40 seconds after entering Egyptian airspace. The plane was carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew, including two babies and one child. The nationalities of the passengers were as follows: 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, one person each from Britain, Belgium, Sudan, Chad, Canada, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, and Algeria.\n\nThe aircraft had passed through airports in Tunisia and Eritrea in the four journeys it made on Wednesday before the Paris-Cairo flight, but no warning flags were raised. EgyptAir's vice-chairman, Ahmed Abdel, said there were \"no reported snags\" from the crew in Cairo or Paris, nor was there any special cargo or notification of dangerous goods on board.\n\nThe area of the Mediterranean where the plane went down is heavily trafficked and monitored, within reach of British listening posts in Cyprus, close to Israel, and near to the US Sixth Fleet. Searches are continuing in the area where the debris was found, with an international air and sea operation underway to find the aircraft's two black box flight recorders, which might hold the key to what happened.\n\nThe water in that section of the Mediterranean can be 2,000 meters (6,500ft) deep. The equipment involved in the search for MH370 is able to search depths of at least 6,000 meters. If the EgyptAir A320 is the same as the Germanwings model that crashed last year, it will have two recording components: a cockpit voice recorder, which tapes what the pilots say, and a flight data recorder, which stores some of the 2,500 technical measurements in a modern aircraft. Both are stored at the back of the aircraft and wrapped in titanium or stainless steel, to best survive a crash. They are able to withstand one hour of 1,100C heat and weight of up to 227kg. The boxes can take years to be found \u2013 two years in the case of Air France flight 447, which disappeared in 2009 in the Atlantic.\n\nGreece's lead air accident investigator, Athanasios Binis, said, \"The most important thing is that the plane's two black boxes are found. If the cockpit flight recorder and flight data recorder are found, along with wreckage, then a real investigation can begin.\" He added, \"There are three reasons for a plane [to go down]. Meteorological, technical, and human. The first has now been ruled out because the weather was quite good. Whether a technical factor or human factor, either inside or outside the plane, is to blame remains to be seen. All possibilities are open.\"\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, said, \"We have a duty to know everything about the cause and what has happened. No theory is ruled out and none is certain right now.\" He added, \"When we have the truth we will draw our conclusions; whether this was an accident or something else, perhaps terrorist. We will have the truth.\"\n\nThe Egyptian prime minister, Sherif Ismail, said it was too early to rule out any explanation for the incident, including terrorism. \"We can not exclude anything at this time or confirm anything. All the search operations must be concluded so we can know the cause.\"\n\nSerafeim Petrou, the head of Greece's air traffic controllers board, said, \"The plane did not give any vocal or electronic signal before it disappeared,\" adding that \"nothing can be excluded\" on causes. \"An explosion could be a possibility but, then, so could damage to the fuselage. I think at this point we are talking about wreckage, wreckage at the bottom of the sea, and tracing the cause is going to take time.\"\n\nJean-Paul Troadec, the ex-president of the French air accident investigation bureau, said, \"We have to remain very careful\" about possible causes. \"We can make certain hypotheses... there's a strong possibility of an explosion on board from a bomb or a suicide bomber. The idea of a technical accident, when weather conditions were good, seems also possible but not that likely. We could also consider a missile... If the crew didn't send an alert signal, it's because what happened was very sudden. A problem with an engine or a technical fault would not produce an immediate accident. In this case, the crew did not react, which makes us think of a bomb.\"\n\nThe director of Greece's Civil Aviation Authority, Konstantinos Lintzerakos, said air traffic controllers were in contact with the pilot as the plane passed through Greek airspace, and that he did not report any problems. Controllers tried to make contact again with the pilot 10 miles before the flight exited the Greek flight information range, Lintzerakos added, but the pilot did not respond.",
    " Title: Nike Recalls Fourth of July-Themed Shoe Featuring Betsy Ross Flag\n\nArticle:\n\nNike has recalled a Fourth of July-themed sneaker featuring the Betsy Ross flag, following controversy over the symbol's historical association with slavery. The controversy arose after Nike announced the new shoe, which was adorned with the Betsy Ross flag on the heel, and shipped to stores.\n\nAccording to reports, the decision to recall the shoe was made at the request of Colin Kaepernick, former NFL football player and current Nike representative. A Nike spokesperson stated, \"Nike has chosen not to release the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July as it featured the old version of the American flag.\"\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag, which features 13 stars in a circle on a field of white and red stripes, has been a symbol of American folklore, representing the 13 original colonies. However, some argue that the flag has been co-opted by white nationalists, leading to calls for its removal from public spaces and products.\n\nThe controversy over the Betsy Ross flag has sparked debate over the appropriateness of using national or civic symbols that have been associated with racist ideologies. Some argue that these symbols should not be ceded to racists, while others argue that they should be reclaimed as symbols of American history and values.\n\nIt is worth noting that the historical accuracy of Betsy Ross's role in designing the flag is a matter of dispute. The Washington Post reports that there is little evidence to support assertions by her descendants that she was a national heroine in the 1870s.\n\nThe decision to recall the Nike shoe has sparked backlash, particularly among those on the right. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he is canceling incentives the state had offered Nike to build a plant there.

According to CNN, at least nine of Carson's childhood classmates had no recollection of events as described by Carson.\n\nWhen Camerota asked Carson about CNN's report, a visibly frustrated Carson raised his voice from a whisper to a more forceful inside voice.\n\n\"This is a bunch of lies attempting to say I'm lying about my history, I think it's pathetic,\" Carson responded. \"Basically, what the media does is they try to get you distracted.\"\n\nCarson also addressed specific discrepancies, namely why the CNN reporters who traveled to Detroit were unable to identify any of his past victims.\n\n\"The names I used for instance are fictitious names because I do not want to bring people into something like this because I know what you guys do to their lives,\" Carson explained. \"That's not the real name, but yes he's a very real person. I talked to him yesterday.\"\n\nCarson also defended his changing of the name and relation of the young man he claimed to have stabbed as an adolescent, stating that he used fictitious names to protect the individuals' privacy.\n\nThe interview became increasingly contentious as Camerota pressed Carson on his complaints of media bias, with Carson accusing CNN of participating in a \"longstanding journalistic practice of vetting presidential candidates.\"\n\nCarson also faced questions about a 2014 speech during which he said \"we'd be Cuba if there were no Fox News,\" and joked that some Americans are \"stupid.\" When Camerota attempted to clarify which Americans he was describing as \"stupid,\" Carson became defensive and refused to provide a clear answer.\n\nImmediately after the contentious interview, Carson appeared on Breitbart News' Sirius XM radio program to continue his attack on the media.\n\n\"I am going to fight CNN tooth and nail,\" Carson said. \"They will see, believe me, they will see.\"\n\nCarson also accused CNN of coming from a place of falsehood, while he claimed to be coming from a place of truth.\n\n\"Truth always wins,\" Carson added.",
    " Title: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Avoids Addressing Allegations of Anti-Semitism in Women's March Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a demonstration with a Women's March group near Central Park, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was confronted about the growing issue of alleged anti-Semitism within the Women's March movement. Instead of addressing the concerns, Ocasio-Cortez shifted the focus to the Trump administration, claiming, without providing evidence, that the White House has an anti-Semitism problem.\n\nIn a separate incident, right-wing activist Laura Loomer confronted Ocasio-Cortez, asking, \"Why are you standing with people who openly support Hamas, a terrorist organization that kills Jewish people?\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez neither addressed the allegations of anti-Semitism within the Women's March movement nor denounced the alleged anti-Semitic sentiments among its members. The Women's March movement has been embroiled in a scandal over allegations of anti-Semitism, including support for Louis Farrakhan, the removal of Jewish leaders, and co-president Tamika Mallory's refusal to affirm Israel's right to exist. The Democratic National Committee and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) are among those who have cut ties with the organization due to these allegations.",
    " Title: Trump Establishes White House Faith-Based Initiative to Protect Religious Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn observance of the National Day of Prayer, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, establishing a new White House faith-based initiative to safeguard religious freedom.\n\nAddressing faith leaders in the White House Rose Garden, President Trump stated, \"As president, I will always protect religious liberty. Prayer has always been the center of American life. It's forged the identity and destiny of this great nation that we all love.\" Vice President Mike Pence added, \"The American people believe in prayer.\"\n\nThe faith initiative aims to enable individuals to exercise their beliefs freely and provide equal access to government funding for faith-based organizations. The executive order calls for the executive branch to uphold \"conscience protections\" that allow people and institutions to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the federal government.\n\nThe order states, \"It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.\" It also directs the Treasury Department not to target churches or religious groups for speaking about political issues.\n\nJohnnie Moore, an unofficial spokesman for the president's faith advisors, praised the move, stating, \"This executive order is the product of the President's unwavering prioritization of faith and religious liberty and reflects the smart work of people like Jared Kushner and advisors in the policy and public liaison divisions who met with hundreds and hundreds of leaders and government officials to assess ways in which the government can partner more effectively with communities of faith.\"\n\nEvangelist Franklin Graham and California pastor and evangelist Greg Laurie also expressed support for the new initiative. However, Michael Wear, an author and former Obama White House staffer, expressed cautious optimism, stating, \"It remains to be seen whether this Administration is truly interested in building an initiative that is focused on helping diverse faith communities serve those in need, or if the real value they see is in using the office as a platform where elite political supporters can pose as statesmen.\"\n\nThe White House Office of Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships was initiated by President George W. Bush in 2001. Under President Barack Obama, Joshua DuBois established an advisory council where members were appointed to one-year terms. The National Day of Prayer is held on the first Thursday of May, and this year's theme is \"unity in America.\"",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Accuses Hillary Clinton of Defamation Over 'Russian Asset' Claim\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of defamation over a statement that implied Gabbard was a Russian asset. In a letter from the Gabbard campaign's legal counsel, the campaign insists that Gabbard is not a Russian asset and that Clinton knew the statement was untrue when she made it.\n\nThe letter, part of Gabbard's continuing pushback, was issued in response to Clinton's appearance on the podcast Campaign HQ with David Plouffe on Oct. 17. During the conversation, Clinton said, \"I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. And, that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she's also a Russian asset. Yeah, she's a Russian asset. I mean, totally.\"\n\nThe following day, a CNN reporter asked a Clinton spokesperson if Clinton was talking about Gabbard, to which the spokesperson replied, \"If the nesting doll fits.\" This implied that the statement was indeed about Gabbard.\n\nThe Gabbard campaign's letter further states that Gabbard is \"a patriotic loyal American, a sitting four-term United States Congresswoman and a Major in the United States Army National Guard\" and that \"she is a loyal American who has taken an oath declaring her allegiance to the United States of America both as a soldier and as a member of Congress.\"\n\nEarly reports about Clinton's comments suggested that the former secretary of state meant that Gabbard was being groomed to be a third-party candidate by Russians, but it was later clarified that she was referring to Republicans. The Gabbard campaign's letter accused Clinton of putting a \"spin\" on the statement to avoid liability.\n\n\"This Republicans-not-Russians spin developed only after you realized the defamatory nature of your statement, and therefore your legal liability, as well as the full extent of the public backlash against your statement,\" the letter said. \"Moreover, the Republicans-not-Russians spin can not explain away your statement that Congresswoman Gabbard is 'a Russian asset,'\" it continued. \"That is, of course, because your Republicans-not-Russians spin is rubbish.\"\n\nGabbard has gone on record stating she has no intention of running as a third-party candidate if she fails to win the Democratic nomination. The letter concluded by presenting a statement for Clinton to post on her Twitter account and send to major media outlets, apologizing. The proposed statement would say that she \"was wrong,\" made a \"grave mistake and error in judgment,\" and that she \"supports\" and \"admires\" Gabbard's work. The letter also demanded that Clinton \"immediately\" hold a press conference to make a verbal retraction of her past statement.\n\nFox News reached out to the Gabbard campaign asking if the congresswoman intends to sue if Clinton does not meet these demands, but they did not immediately respond.",
    " Title: Trump to Sign Executive Order Imposing Sanctions on Foreign Entities Interfering in U.S. Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order as early as Wednesday, which will impose sanctions on foreign companies or individuals found to be interfering in U.S. elections based on intelligence agency findings, according to two sources familiar with the matter. This move comes as intelligence agencies, military, and law enforcement prepare to defend the upcoming November 6 congressional elections from predicted foreign attacks.\n\nThe executive order's targets could include individuals or entire companies accused of interfering in U.S. elections through cyber attacks or other means, a U.S. official told the sources. The order is intended to establish new norms in cyberspace and set boundaries for bad behavior, the official stated.\n\nThe order will place a range of agencies in charge of deciding if election meddling has occurred, led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and including the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the Homeland Security Department, according to the sources. A recent draft of the order reviewed by a U.S. official defines election interference as hacking attempts against \"election infrastructure\" and efforts to sway public opinion through coordinated digital propaganda or systematic leaks of private political information.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have found that Russian hackers breached the Democratic National Committee and leaked confidential information during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Congress has been purposefully left out of the executive order drafting process, the official said, as the administration wants to preempt legislation being considered in the House and Senate that addresses similar issues.\n\nCongress has introduced various pieces of Russia-related legislation, including the \"Deter Act\" to set out punishments for election meddling, and a sanctions bill aimed at punishing Moscow for cybercrime and its activities in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere. Both Democrats and Republicans are looking to address what they consider Trump's weak stance on accusations of Russian interference in 2016, following Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in July, during which Trump accepted Putin's denials over the word of his own intelligence agencies.\n\nActing on a Russia sanctions bill passed more than a year ago, the U.S. Treasury imposed major sanctions against 24 Russians, striking at allies of Putin in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow.",
    " Title: \"Civility in Politics: A Growing Movement Toward Common Ground and Constructive Dialogue\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the contentious Kavanaugh hearings and subsequent debates, a growing concern for the state of civility in American politics has emerged. A recent Axios poll found that more than half of Americans have discussed the Kavanaugh confirmation battle at work, and almost three-quarters of Americans have talked about it with friends and family. Surprisingly, over three-quarters of Americans say their discussions about the Supreme Court appointee have been civil.\n\nThis finding is in stark contrast to an annual poll tracking discourse in the United States, where 93 percent of Americans think the U.S. has a civility problem. The percentage of Americans viewing the opposite party unfavorably has doubled in the last two decades, and 86 percent of Americans say conflicts between Democrats and Republicans are strong or very strong.\n\nThe lack of civility in politics has been a topic of concern for notable figures across the political spectrum. Michelle Obama, in a recent speech at a voter registration rally in Las Vegas, expressed her disdain for the \"nastiness of our politics.\" Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) during the Kavanaugh hearings expressed his concern over tribalism, stating that it is \"tearing our country apart.\"\n\nIn the Virginia Senate race, a Republican challenger pledged a \"vicious, ruthless campaign\" to unseat the Democrat incumbent, implying without evidence that his opponent committed sexual assault. A Democratic representative from California warned members of Donald Trump's Cabinet to be prepared for an onslaught of heckling and public shaming if they continue to support the president's policy on undocumented immigrants.\n\nTo address this issue, individuals and organizations are advocating for a shift in the default model for public discourse from fact-light, talking-point-based, and anger-laced argument to willingly seeking and finding common ground with the other side. Elected officials who demonstrate a willingness to work with those with different political views should be supported, and candidates who speak out against speech and policies designed to divide us should be chosen.\n\nOrganizations such as the Common Ground Committee, Living Room Conversations, Better Angels, and The Bridge Alliance are working to remove the threat of incivility and promote constructive dialogue. These organizations stress listening, accepting nuances, putting country before self-interest, and asking Americans with varying political beliefs and backgrounds to do the same.\n\nThe Common Ground Committee, for example, brings prominent leaders with opposing views together in public forums to find common ground. After the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Donna Brazile (former interim DNC chairwoman) and Michael Steele (former RNC chairman) participated in a CGC public forum to discuss government's role in bridging racial divides. Brazile and Steele engaged with respect and a sense of conviction that we can all move beyond deep, destructive tribalism.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing movement for civil discourse, finding common ground, and focusing on solutions rather than arguments is a positive step towards reducing toxic polarization and evoking civil dialogue. By demonstrating the value and power of civil discourse, we can shift the cultural norm from winning at all costs to finding common ground whenever possible. This will allow our leaders to make progress quicker and more frequently on the issues that matter.",
    " Title: Majority of Voters Favor Repeal of Obamacare, Poll Finds\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by Fox News indicates that more than half of registered voters would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, if given the opportunity. The survey, which polled 1,017 voters nationwide from July 21-23, found that 53 percent of respondents would vote to repeal the law, while 40 percent would vote to keep it.\n\nThe poll also revealed that 47 percent of respondents believe Obamacare will cost their family more money, while 34 percent said their healthcare costs would remain the same. The expectation of increased healthcare costs comes at a time when 63 percent of the public is dissatisfied with the current state of the country, and 57 percent report seeing no signs of economic recovery.\n\nThe poll's findings show a significant divide along party lines. Seventy percent of Republicans believe Obamacare will cost them more, while 21 percent of Democrats believe it will save them money. A large percentage of Republicans (85 percent) and independents (65 percent) also expressed a desire to repeal the law, compared to 72 percent of Democrats who said it is worth keeping.\n\nRegarding the White House's decision to delay the employer mandate on coverage for a year, 45 percent of respondents overall found it \"unacceptable,\" while 46 percent described it as \"no big deal.\" Seventy-one percent of Democrats said they were fine with the decision, while 68 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of independents disagreed with the decision to delay.\n\nThe survey also asked participants if the \"Medical Loss Ratio\" portion of the healthcare law had returned any savings to them in the form of refunds on some of their premium costs. Only 8 percent of respondents reported that this part of the law, which limits the amount insurance companies can spend on administrative functions, had already saved them money.",
    " Title: DOJ Sides with District Court Ruling, Argues for Full ACA Invalidity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced its support for a district court ruling that declared the Affordable Care Act (ACA) unconstitutional. This move escalates the Trump administration's legal battle against the health care law.\n\nIn the past, the DOJ argued that the ACA's pre-existing condition protections should be struck down. Now, the administration argues that the entire law should be invalidated. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled in December that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional, and the rest of the law is therefore invalid.\n\nThe DOJ stated on Monday that it agrees the decision should stand as the case works its way through the appeals process in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. \"The Department of Justice has determined that the district court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed,\" the department said in a short letter to the appeals court.\n\nThe move is likely to prompt new denunciations from Democrats, who had already criticized the Trump administration's earlier call for the pre-existing condition protections to be struck down. This stance was a major issue in last year's midterm elections, and many Republican candidates in tough races struggled with whether to say they agreed with the Trump administration's position.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was brought by 20 GOP-led states, centers on the argument that since Congress repealed the tax penalty in the ACA's mandate for everyone to have insurance in 2017, the mandate can no longer be ruled constitutional under Congress's power to tax. The challengers then argue that all of ObamaCare should be invalidated because the mandate is unconstitutional.\n\nMost legal experts say that, according to legal precedent, even if the mandate is ruled unconstitutional, the rest of ObamaCare should remain unharmed, as that is what Congress voted to do in the 2017 tax law that repealed the mandate's penalty.

    " Title: Tulsa Police Officer Acquitted in Shooting of Terence Crutcher\n\nArticle:\n\nOn September 16, 2016, Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old motorist, was shot and killed by police officer Betty Jo Shelby in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The shooting led to protests in Tulsa. On May 17, 2017, a jury found Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter.\n\nTerence Crutcher, a black man, was enrolled at Tulsa Community College and was a father. The officers involved in the incident were Betty Shelby and Tyler Turnbough, both white. The shooting occurred on 36th Street North and Lewis Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma, with coordinates 36\u00b012'22.1'' N 95\u00b057'34.6'' W.\n\nAt 7:36 p.m. on September 16, 2016, police received a 9-1-1 call about an abandoned vehicle in the middle of 36th Street North just west of Lewis Avenue. One caller said that the vehicle was blocking traffic, and another said that a man was running from the vehicle, saying it was going to blow up but might have been under the influence of drugs.\n\nPolice stated that Crutcher kept reaching into his pocket, refused to show his hands, walked towards his vehicle despite being told to stop, and then angled towards and reached into his vehicle. Critics have disputed this, stating that the driver's side window was up when Crutcher was shot. Turnbough tased Crutcher, and Shelby shot him.\n\nApproximately two minutes after the shooting, an officer checked Crutcher's pockets, and approximately 45 seconds later, someone crouched to offer aid. Police said Crutcher died in the hospital later that day. Tulsa police chief Chuck Jordan said no weapon was recovered from Crutcher's body or vehicle.\n\nPolice dashcam and helicopter video as well as the dispatch audio were released by police on September 19, 2016. Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan called the video \"disturbing\" and \"difficult to watch.\" The officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nCrutcher's family, protestors, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma called for Shelby to be charged with his death. Autopsy results released by the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner indicated that Crutcher had \"acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication\" at the time of the shooting. The report also indicated that tenocyclidine (TCP), a psychostimulant and hallucinogen which is more potent than PCP, was present.\n\nCriminal charges, trial, and acquittal of police officer\n\nTulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Shelby with first-degree manslaughter. On May 17, 2017, a jury found Betty Shelby not guilty. Betty Shelby then later quit the Tulsa Police Department and became a Rogers County, Oklahoma Sheriff's Deputy.",
    " Title: College Commencement Ceremonies Divided by Identity Politics: A Look at the Controversial Trend of Separate Graduation Events\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the commencement season, young people across the country celebrate the completion of their college careers, marking their interest in various fields such as ideas, innovation, art, and sciences. However, the camaraderie inherent in the college experience is under attack by a divisive tool known as identity politics. This divisive strategy is creating divisions in the very experience that is meant to expand one's worldview and sense of belonging.\n\nCollege is intended to be a transition into adulthood, a shift from living with parents to living independently and encountering people different from oneself. The intention is not only to receive an education from books but also to expand one's understanding of the world beyond oneself.\n\nRecently, there has been a growing concern that the obsession with identity politics and the division it brings has overwhelmed the academy. The leftist strategy of promoting self-regard, otherness, suspicion, and division is taking root in the very institutions that are meant to encourage students to look outside the known, enter the unknown, and make it better with their presence.\n\nA study by the National Association of Scholars indicates that at least 75 American colleges have black-only graduation ceremonies, and 43 percent of surveyed colleges offer segregated residential halls. The organization refers to this as 'neo-segregation.'\n\nIn 2017, Harvard University held a separate commencement ceremony for African American graduates, which made national news. The New York Times had a headline that read, \"Colleges Celebrate Diversity with Separate Commencements.\" In this coverage, the newspaper noted that the event was Harvard's first commencement for black graduate students, and many of the speakers talked about a different, more personal kind of struggle, the struggle to be black at Harvard.\n\nAn organizer of Harvard's separate graduation ceremony told The Associated Press, \"We really wanted an opportunity to give voice to the voiceless at Harvard. So many students identify with the African diaspora but don't necessarily feel welcome as part of the larger community, and they don't feel like their stories are being shared.\"\n\nThe argument for the separate event is that the Ivy League university they've attended for years does not accept them and has racial issues. The answer to that, according to proponents of the separate-but-equal commencement events, is a segregated commencement event, as they are leaving the university, reinforcing the perception they don't feel, or aren't, accepted.\n\nIn any institution involving thousands of people, there will be aspects of racism, sexism, and homophobia. A valuable aspect of a diverse community is that these issues can be confronted and challenged, as part of that community.\n\nThose who laud the separate-but-equal commencement events argue that college students have always associated based on interest and affinities. This is true - there are debate clubs, political science societies, drama leagues, language clubs, etc. In some campus housing, you find people choosing floors that also reflect similar interests like language, math, art history, engineering, or architecture.\n\nComing together in association based on intellectual affinity transcends political partisanship, race, sex, and gender. These leagues are based on ideas and interests, not on slivers of our identities and therefore do not require the exclusion of people because of what they look like or who they love.\n\nWard Connerly, president of the American Civil Rights Institute and a former University of California regent, explained to The Times that events like black commencements \"serve only to 'amplify' racial differences. 'College is the place where we should be teaching and preaching the view that you're an individual, and choose your associates to be based on other factors rather than skin color,' he said.\"\n\nHowever, the left's scourge of identity politics requires division and otherness; it is a premise requiring the view of people unlike yourself as unknowable and unrelatable, and therefore that you, too, are unknowable and relatable.\n\nBeing understood through empathy and the common experience, in these cases, of being a student at Harvard, is what would normally bring people together. Differences in life experience, home life, and interests make friendships and relationships even more interesting and valuable.\n\nThis is how people's lives and points of view are changed and improved. This is how communities are built and thrive. And it is exactly what threatens the reliance on division, suspicion, and hate that the left relies on to organize and control people.\n\nThe heart of the American experience, relationships, empathy, and understanding, and becoming united with people unlike yourself, is the existential threat to the left and to their political narrative, and it is why the left remains obsessed with conditioning people into accepting the dangerous fraud of identity politics.",
    " Title: Obama Suggests Iraqi Political Action Key to Defeating Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama reiterated on Monday his stance that the United States has yet to develop a comprehensive strategy for defeating the Islamic State (IS), a position that has drawn criticism in the past. However, during a press conference in Germany, he offered some insights into his statement, suggesting that the U.S. is withholding its commitments to Iraq to pressure the government to take the political steps necessary for any anti-IS strategy to succeed.\n\nA \"complete strategy... requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well,\" Mr. Obama said, speaking at a press conference wrapping up a two-day summit of the Group of Seven industrialized Western countries. The Iraqi government, he added, must establish \"how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place.\"\n\nAt the same time, Obama emphasized that Iraq must take steps to build an \"inclusive\" government that serves Iraq's Shiite, Sunni, and Kurd communities equally. \"If Sunnis, Kurds, and Shia all feel as if their concerns are being addressed, and that operating within a legitimate political structure can meet their need for security, prosperity, nondiscrimination, then we \u2019ll have a much easier time,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, the president met with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who was invited to the Western-powers confab to review the anti-IS battle and to present his case for more international assistance.\n\nObama alluded to the reluctance of the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad to enlist and arm Sunnis in the country's security forces as an impediment to a successful campaign against IS. Noting that, at the moment, there is actually more training capacity in Iraq than recruits coming forward to be trained, he said, \"A big part of the answer there is our outreach to Sunni tribes.... It has not been happening as fast as it needs to.\"\n\nThe U.S. has encouraged Iraq to create a national guard as a means of facilitating the creation of local security forces and the arming of Sunni tribes, but legislation to that effect has languished for months.\n\nThe president did not absolve the U.S. and other countries of responsibility for the setbacks Iraq has experienced in the fight with IS, noting in particular that neighboring and Western countries have failed to stem the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe international effort to address the influx of foreign fighters seeking to fight for IS \u2013 an effort Obama launched last September with a special session of the United Nations Security Council \u2013 has \"made some progress, but not enough,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. and European countries have to do a better job of stopping their citizens who aim to join the ranks of IS, but he also singled out Turkey for failing to adequately control its border with Syria \u2013 the border that most foreign fighters cross to join IS.\n\n\"If we can cut off some of that foreign fighter flow, then we are able to isolate and wear out ISIL forces that are already there,\" Obama said, using the acronym for IS that the U.S. government prefers. \"We are taking a lot of them off the battlefield,\" he added, \"but if they\u2019re being replenished, then it doesn\u2019t solve the problem over the long term.\"\n\nObama made the \"no complete strategy\" comment last August, when he said the administration had to consult with Congress and foreign partners who would be called on to join an anti-IS coalition before formulating a plan to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" IS.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to put the cart before the horse,\" he said then. \"We don\u2019t have a strategy yet.\"\n\nObama's suggestion nearly a year later that the formulation of a \"complete strategy\" is being held up at least to some degree by a lack of Iraqi political action does not appear to have satisfied all the president's critics.\n\n\"What has President Obama been doing for 10 months?\" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said in response to the president's comments sent out to reporters.\n\n\"Nearly a year after first saying he didn\u2019t have a strategy to combat ISIS,\" said Mr. Short, using another acronym for IS, \"President Obama again today said there is still not a complete strategy to take on the terrorist group.\"\n\nHowever, some regional analysts heard Obama's comment as a warning to the Iraqi government \u2013 and principally to Prime Minister Abadi \u2013 that receiving stepped-up assistance depends on their political actions.\n\n\"This was very definitely aimed at Abadi and the Iraqis,\" says Lawrence Korb, a senior national security fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington and a former Pentagon official. \"It was meant to send him a message to get going and do some of the things we think are holding up progress\" against IS.\n\nThe White House saw in Abadi \"a more inclusive leader\" than Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite hard-liner he replaced, but has since realized that Abadi is either unwilling or politically unable to draw in a suspicious Sunni community, Mr. Korb says.",
    " Title: Biden's Critique of English Jurisprudential Culture at Biden Courage Awards Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the Biden Courage Awards ceremony in preparation for his presidential campaign launch. In his speech, Biden criticized a central pillar of Western civilization, claiming that English jurisprudential culture is inherently racist.\n\nBiden's statement, according to historians and legal scholars, is historically inaccurate. The \"rule of thumb\" story, which Biden referenced, has been debunked for years. There was no \"rule of thumb,\" as feminist scholar Christina Hoff Sommers points out. \"On the contrary,\" she writes, \"British law since the 1700s and our American laws predating the Revolution prohibit wife beating.\"\n\nMoreover, Biden's characterization of \"English jurisprudential culture\" as \"white man's culture\" is profoundly disturbing. English jurisprudential culture is rooted in the belief in the rule of law, due process of law, and equal rights under law. English jurisprudential culture is responsible for preserving the natural rights we hold dear, rights which were imperfectly but increasingly extended over time to more and more human beings, particularly minorities.\n\nIn 2009, former President Barack Obama, a leftist figure, explained that he sought a system at Guantanamo Bay that \"adheres to the rule of law, habeas corpus, basic principles of Anglo-American legal system.\" Protection of individual rights, and in particular, minority rights, lies at the heart of English jurisprudence.\n\nBiden's reduction of those rights to racial privilege is both false and frightening. It suggests that those principles ought to be undermined for purposes of disestablishing a supposed racial hierarchy. Get rid of English jurisprudential law, presumably, in order to fight racism.\n\nIronically, the reduction of Western civilization to racial supremacy is not just a strategy of the intersectional left; it's a strategy of the despicable alt-right, which champions Western civilization as white civilization and then seeks to rip away the universalism of its principles from nonwhite people. Thus, the very term \"Western civilization\" is under assault by a variety of political forces seeking to tear out eternal truths and natural rights in the name of tribalism.\n\nHowever, that's not what Western civilization is about at all. Western civilization was built on Judeo-Christian values and Greek reason, culminating in a perspective on natural rights that is preserved by institutions like English jurisprudence. It is thanks to those philosophical principles that free markets, free speech, and free association have grown and flourished. Only if we re-enshrine those principles, rather than undermine them, will our prosperity and freedoms be preserved.",
    " Title: Rising Veterans' Disability Payments and the Impact on Employment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States government provides disability payments to veterans, separate from medical costs associated with treating an injury. These payments are set at varying levels to compensate for an assumed inability to work. Since 2000, the average payout has increased by 60 percent (inflation-adjusted), and the proportion of veterans receiving some form of compensation has nearly doubled.\n\nWhile most veterans who receive disability checks are genuinely in need, there is a perception that the system can be manipulated. Claiming the right combination of symptoms, regardless of actual suffering, can potentially lead to a monthly, tax-free disability check for life. There are even blogs available to guide individuals through the process of claiming an injury that may be difficult to disprove.\n\nIn some cases, the process requires minimal effort. A veteran who left the Navy in 2005, for example, filled out a form and underwent a medical exam to document a fractured shoulder sustained in the line of duty. Soon after, they received a rating and their first monthly direct-deposit payment.\n\nThe veteran, feeling no entitlement beyond medical care, attempted to discontinue the payment but was informed that there was no process for doing so. The ability to hold a full-time job had no bearing on their disability rating.\n\nAs a nation, we have a duty to care for those who have fought our battles. However, the current disability-compensation regime warrants closer scrutiny, not only for financial prudence but also to avoid fostering a culture of dependency. A recent study by Mark Duggan, an economist at Stanford, linked rising disability payments to increased unemployment among veterans. The author suggests that such payments may reduce the \"recipient's propensity to work\" because disability checks eliminate the need for a job.",
    " Title: Republican Party's Shift Away from Free Trade Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party, traditionally known for its adherence to free market principles, appears to be abandoning its commitment to free trade in favor of protectionist policies, particularly under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump's frequent criticisms of trade and trade agreements influenced other Republican candidates, such as Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, to advocate for \"fair\" trade, a term often associated with protectionism.\n\nSince taking office, President Trump has pursued a comprehensive protectionist agenda, threatening foreign governments with a potential trade war and imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from various countries, including the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. These tariffs may be followed by automobile tariffs. Trump justifies these actions by claiming that imports from these countries \"threaten to impair the national security\" of the United States, despite six of the top 10 providers of steel to the U.S. being NATO allies.\n\nIn response to this diplomatic backlash and potential negative economic impact, Republicans in Congress have taken no action. This inaction is not due to a lack of power, but rather a lack of political will. They could pass legislation to reverse the imposition of tariffs or reclaim some of the authority they delegated to the president to impose tariffs, as suggested by Sens. Mike Lee and Ron Johnson.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, in recent appearances on Sunday shows, argued that tariffs on European and Canadian imports are necessary for the sake of free trade and that they represent the United States \"standing up for the process.\" However, these arguments are misleading.\n\nImposing tariffs is unlikely to persuade other countries to lower their own tariffs, as McCarthy suggests. Historically, the United States has encouraged other countries to lower their trade barriers by being decisively pro-free trade. Leading by protectionism will only lead to more protectionism.\n\nFurthermore, these tariffs will increase the cost of producing goods made with steel within the United States, making it more difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete with foreigners who make goods out of steel without the added cost of tariffs. This will result in lost U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n\nMcCarthy's claim that the Trump administration is \"standing up for the process\" through tariffs is also misleading. The national security argument is questionable when levying tariffs against NATO allies. In fact, during a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation, the Department of Defense wrote a letter stating that no tariffs were needed to protect national security, as the DOD's military needs are fulfilled by only 3% of the domestic steel production.\n\nThe potential dangers of Trump's move will become clear when those former allies drag the U.S. before the World Trade Organization and the U.S. loses, as experts predict. Many have long surmised that the Republican Party stands for little more than low taxes, but its commitment to free trade, a traditionally Republican principle, is waning.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Border Separation Policy Faces Criticism as Optics Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border has faced criticism this week, with some calling it inhumane and unacceptable. The policy, which has been criticized for its \"optics,\" or public perception, may lead to a reevaluation of the current approach.\n\nSenator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) provided an example of the rhetoric surrounding the issue, stating, \"Ripping children out of their parents' arms to inflict harm on the child to influence the parents is unacceptable.\"\n\nFormer First Lady Laura Bush also weighed in, writing in a Washington Post column that the policy is \"cruel.\" First Lady Melania Trump herself expressed dismay, stating in a formal statement that she \"hates to see children separated from their families\" and urges \"successful immigration reform.\"\n\nThe policy has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that it is necessary to enforce immigration laws, while others argue that it is inhumane. It is important to note that an illegal entrant into the United States brings no rights with them, and they are dependent on the kindness of strangers.\n\nThe matter is complex, with valid arguments for and against laxity on immigration. The policy has sparked international concern and sympathy for the families affected, with many questioning the morality of separating children from their parents.\n\nIt is unclear what the future holds for the policy, as both sides of the argument have valid points. Some argue for strong and persuasive vetting of prospective immigrants, while others argue that America's shrinking workforce needs more workers and contributors to Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIt is likely that both Republicans and Democrats take aboard these seemingly opposed considerations, but are obliged by the politics of the moment to tear out each other's throats. The policy is not just about children being separated from their parents, but about human destiny and the kind of country we hope to be 50 years hence. There are no winners in this cause at present.",
    " Title: Polls and Fundraising Suggest Disastrous Election Outcome for Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nWith less than 100 days remaining before the 2020 election, recent polls and fundraising data suggest a potentially disastrous outcome for the Republican party.\n\nAccording to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, only 38% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while 60% disapprove. In a similar poll conducted in March, 51% approved of Trump's handling of the pandemic, with 45% disapproving.\n\nThe shift in public opinion towards Trump's handling of the pandemic has coincided with a move towards Joe Biden in general election polling. The former vice president currently leads Trump by 15 and 11 points in two new national polls released this week.\n\nIn addition to the shift in public opinion towards Trump, Democrats have also seen a significant increase in party identification. According to a new Gallup poll, 50% of Americans identify as Democrats or Democratic leaners, while 39% describe themselves as Republicans or Republican leaners. This represents a major shift from January, when Republicans had a 47% to 45% edge on party identification in Gallup polling.\n\nFurthermore, Democratic candidates in the 11 most competitive Senate contests in the country raised a collective $67.3 million between April 1 and June 30, compared to $46.8 million for their Republican counterparts, according to tabulations made by the Wall Street Journal. The same trend is seen in the House, where Democratic candidates raised $457 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared to $365 million for Republican candidates.\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, the fundraising difference is even larger in swing districts currently held by well-funded Democratic incumbents. In 13 races holding primaries in June and July that are considered competitive by the Cook Political Report, incumbent Democrats have 9 times more money in the bank than the best-funded Republican challengers.\n\nOn Friday, the Cook Political Report moved 20 House races in favor of Democrats, an unprecedented shift to one party. As House editor David Wasserman wrote, \"President Trump's abysmal polling since the pandemic began is seriously jeopardizing down-ballot GOP fortunes. We may be approaching the point at which dozens of House Republicans will need to decide whether to cut the president loose and run on a 'check and balance' message, offering voters insurance against congressional Democrats moving too far left under a potential Biden administration.\"\n\nThe Senate has also been in play for at least nine months, but Democratic chances of winning control of the chamber have improved significantly in the last few weeks. According to the Cook Report, Democrats need a net gain of four seats for a majority, but can control the Senate by gaining three seats and winning the White House. With less than four months to go before Election Day, the most likely outcome is a Democratic net gain of 3-5 Senate seats.\n\nOn the presidential level, Trump is in equally bad shape. The Cook Report gives Biden 279 electoral votes in the solid, likely, or leaning Democrat categories, as compared to just 188 for Trump. This week, the University of Virginia's Crystal Ball moved seven traditional Republican strongholds from safe Republican states to likely Republican states and into the slate of potential competitive races in the presidential race.\n\n\"Trump is extremely unlikely to win if the polls continue to look the way they do now,\" the Cook Report notes. \"And if these numbers represent a new normal, we need to account for the possibility that this election won't be particularly close, and that new states may come into play. In other words, if the national picture remains bleak for Trump, then the slippage he's seen from earlier this year wouldn't just be limited to a handful of swing states.\"",
    " Title: Dr. Ben Carson Steps Down as Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Commencement Speaker Following Controversial Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nNeurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson has stepped down as commencement speaker at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine following a backlash over controversial comments regarding same-sex marriage. In a letter to Dean Paul Rothman, Carson wrote that the national media attention surrounding his traditional marriage beliefs would be best for the students if he voluntarily withdrew as the commencement speaker this year.\n\nCarson's controversial remarks were made during his March 26 appearance on Fox News' Hannity. He compared efforts to overturn bans on same-sex marriage to those advocating for bestiality and the North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA).\n\nThe backlash led to a student-led petition for Carson's removal as commencement speaker, with more than half of the graduating class reportedly signing it. Carson was also criticized by colleagues at Johns Hopkins who found his comments \"hurtful\" and \"extremely discouraging.\"\n\nIn a statement to a news outlet, the co-director of Johns Hopkins University's Program for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, Professor Todd Shepard, described Carson's statements as \"nasty, petty, and ill-informed.\" Carson eventually apologized for his comments, but later called his critics \"racists.\"\n\nCarson has previously written that marriage equality could lead to the fall of America like the \"fall of the Roman Empire.\" As of April 2, Carson was scheduled to give the keynote address at a banquet hosted by the Illinois Family Institute, an anti-gay hate group.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, Carson also stepped down as speaker for the Johns Hopkins University School of Education diploma ceremony.

    " Title: Felicity Huffman Sentenced to 14 Days in Prison for College Admissions Scam\n\n Article:\n\n Actress Felicity Huffman, known for her role in the television series \"Desperate Housewives,\" has been sentenced to 14 days in prison for her involvement in the \"Varsity Blues\" college entrance scam. The sentence also includes a $30,000 fine, 250 hours of community service, and one year of probation.\n\n Huffman, 56, is due to self-report to a federal prison facility on October 25. In a statement issued shortly after the sentencing, Huffman accepted the judge's decision and expressed remorse for her actions.\n\n \"I accept the court's decision today without reservation,\" Huffman said in the statement. \"I have always been prepared to accept whatever punishment Judge Talwani imposed. I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\"\n\n Huffman also apologized to her daughter, her husband, her family, and the educational community for her actions. She added that she has learned a lot about her flaws and aims to serve her sentence, complete her community service hours, and make a positive impact on her community.\n\n Before announcing her decision, Judge Indira Talwani stated that she was not punishing Huffman for a flawed college admissions process but for taking an extra advantage to put her child ahead of others.\n\n Huffman tearfully apologized to her daughters and husband in court, stating that her actions had caused significant damage. She pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to commit mail fraud and honest service mail fraud and admitted to paying $15,000 to falsify her daughter Sophia's SAT score.\n\n Huffman's lawyers had asked Talwani to impose a one-year probation term, 250 hours of community service, and a $20,000 fine. However, federal prosecutors asked the judge to sentence Huffman to one month of incarceration, followed by 12 months of supervised release and a fine of $20,000.\n\n The college admissions scam, the largest ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, involved 50 people, including Huffman and more than 30 other wealthy parents. The indictment alleges that the parents paid bribes to college entrance tutor guru William \"Rick\" Singer to get their children into elite colleges, including Stanford, the University of Southern California, Princeton, and Georgetown. Singer, who collected $25 million in bribes during the years-long scam, pleaded guilty in March and is yet to be sentenced.\n\n Actress Lori Loughlin, best known as Aunt Becky on the sitcom \"Full House,\" and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are fighting charges they paid Singer $500,000 to get their two daughters into USC as recruits for the university's crew team, despite the fact they had never participated in the sport.\n\n Huffman's lawyers presented Talwani with letters vouching for her character from the actress's relatives, including her husband, actor William H. Macy, and former colleagues such as Eva Longoria, a fellow cast member on \"Desperate Housewives.\" Huffman and Macy allegedly made arrangements to pursue the scheme a second time for their younger daughter, but did not do so. Macy was not charged in the scam.",
    " Title: Federal Reserve Rate Cut: Limited Impact on Personal Finances, Experts Say\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark interest rate again, a move that, while significant for the U.S. economy, is expected to have a muted impact on Americans' personal finances, according to experts. This is because the recent cuts do not offset the increases of previous years, and as the key rate approaches zero, financial institutions are less inclined to pass borrowing benefits along to consumers.\n\nThe Fed's key rate, which affects a wide range of consumer and business loans, was reduced to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday. This follows a similar reduction in July, despite a relatively healthy economy, due to concerns about slowing economic growth and global trade tensions.\n\nThe latest move may have the following implications for consumers:\n\n1. Mortgage Rates: Mortgage rates remain near historic lows, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3.56% as of last week, compared to 4.6% a year ago, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, estimates that a full percentage point difference is \"the single biggest impact on consumers\" in this low-rate environment. Lower interest rates on mortgages can lead to savings for homeowners who refinance or for those shopping for a house.\n\n2. Other Forms of Borrowing: The rate for other forms of borrowing, such as credit cards, home equity loans, or personal loans, will not see significant changes. Credit card rates, for example, track the bank prime rate, which is 3% above the federal funds target rate. The prime rate will move down immediately after the Fed's decision, but many credit card issuers may not adjust rates downwards due to default risk or increased profits.\n\n3. Savings Accounts: Interest rates on savings accounts were already historically low and will likely remain so. The average interest rate on a savings account in the U.S. is 0.09%, according to the FDIC. While some lenders offer high-yield savings accounts with rates well above the national average, these rates are likely to dip after the most recent announcement.\n\nIn light of these changes, experts advise consumers to take steps to strengthen their finances, such as paying down debt, refinancing at lower rates, and boosting emergency savings. This, they say, will enable households to better weather an economic downturn whenever it may occur.",
    " Title: GOP Leader Predicts Keystone XL Pipeline Approval by President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC on Tuesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus expressed confidence that a Republican-controlled House and Senate will pass a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, and that President Barack Obama will likely sign it.\n\nWhen asked about specific legislation a Republican Congress would pass following the elections, Priebus stated, \"We will pass a budget in both chambers, number one. And we will pass the Keystone pipeline, number two. I actually think the president will sign the bill on the Keystone pipeline.\"\n\nThe GOP leader argued that there will be greater political pressure on the president to approve the pipeline project due to legislative action. The Keystone XL pipeline, an oil pipeline between Canada and the U.S., has been a contentious issue for years, with many Republicans and some Democrats pushing for the Obama White House to sign off on the project. Critics have argued that the job creation will be negligible and that the pipeline would have significant environmental costs and contribute to climate change.\n\nIn April, the State Department instituted another delay in making a decision on the project, which Republicans and advocates on both sides decried as politically motivated.\n\nDuring the interview, Priebus also expressed expectations for big gains in the elections but stated that he would not be pleased unless Republicans are able to win in at least one swing state. \"I wouldn't be happy unless \u2014 we've got to win a purple state or two, as well as taking the majority [in the Senate],\" he said.\n\nMost forecasts show that Republicans are favored to win seats in the House and take control of the Senate, where Democrats in red states have struggled to distance themselves from the Obama White House. \"In a good environment with a very unpopular president, we ought to win in tough states,\" Priebus added.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Proposes End to Deportation for Millions of Illegal Immigrants, Trump Criticizes Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has announced her intention to end deportation for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States if elected president. Speaking before the National Associations of Black and Hispanic Journalists in Washington, Clinton also pledged to introduce legislation within the first 100 days of her potential administration to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the economy.\n\nClinton urged voters to help Democrats retake the Senate in November, claiming that they would \"fast track\" her proposal. She stated, \"This is a clear high priority for my administration. We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can.\"\n\nIn contrast, Republican nominee Donald Trump's campaign claimed that Clinton's plan would grant her \"king-like powers\" that would harm Americans. Trump has vowed to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants and has called Clinton's plan amnesty for those in the U.S. illegally, stating it would \"totally open borders.\"\n\nClinton's comments suggest that she would follow President Obama's example of taking executive action on immigration reform. The Supreme Court in June split 4-4 on Obama's 2014 plan to defer deportation for roughly 4.3 million parents of Americans and other lawful permanent residents. Clinton, like Trump, would attempt to appoint a justice for the high court's ninth and open seat to help win favorable decisions on such issues.\n\nClinton's campaign website states, \"Hillary believes DAPA is squarely within the president's authority and won't stop fighting until we see it through.\" The website also mentions Clinton's intention to defend the president's 2012 executive action to defer deportation for millions of people brought into the United States illegally by their parents.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who has long argued that \"amnesty\" would take away jobs from unemployed Americans, issued a five-page statement on Friday attacking Clinton's policies dating back to May 2015. The Senate bill died in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nTrump has called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. in the wake of several deadly attacks inspired or directed by ISIS. Trump has since suggested a ban only for Muslims coming from such Middle East terror hotspots as Syria.\n\nMiller argued on Friday that Clinton's first-100-day pledge is also dangerous. \"Her pledge \u2014 in the middle of a national security and a border security crisis \u2014 demonstrates her callous and cruel disregard for the safety of the American people,\" Miller wrote. \"This administration has released hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants, and yet Clinton says she wants to go even further, ending virtually all deportations and ending all protections Americans have against open borders.\"",
    " Title: Obamacare Enrollment Data Transparency: Calls for Greater Openness Amidst Controversy Over Inflated Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nControversy over inflated Obamacare enrollment numbers has renewed demands for the administration to be more open about sign-up data and other crucial aspects of the health care law. This is not just a concern from Republican opponents on Capitol Hill; consumer groups, health experts, and even strong Obamacare advocates are pushing for increased transparency.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee revealed on Thursday that nearly 400,000 dental plans were included in recent enrollment figures, leading to the misconception that the administration had reached the 7 million target for Obamacare's first year. The committee has called CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner and former Obamacare adviser Jonathan Gruber to testify next month about the \"repeated transparency failures and outright deceptions.\"\n\nThe second season of Obamacare began last Saturday, but there has been no enrollment update since Sunday morning, when HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell tweeted that there were more than half a million log-ins on HealthCare.gov on the first day and that 100,000 applications were submitted. By contrast, several of the 13 health insurance exchanges run by states have been regularly releasing traffic and enrollment-related data. Massachusetts, for instance, is issuing daily traffic counts.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) declined to provide an enrollment update on Friday afternoon. The agency has said it would provide detailed monthly reports of plan selection, although this would fall short of the detailed list of suggestions that the Association of Health Care Journalists sent to the agency in late October. The group requested weekly or biweekly releases with more granular data than last year's reports provided.\n\nFederal health officials have yet to fully explain the nature of what Burwell said Thursday was an \"unacceptable\" mistake in including the dental plan data in the August and October enrollment totals. However, in a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, Tavenner suggested that part of the problem was the still unfinished back end of HealthCare.gov\u2014the part that communicates with insurance companies.\n\nThe administration seemed able to turn the numbers around pretty quickly when Obamacare's initial drama started turning around. During the month after the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov last October, HHS was virtually a black box\u2014except for when it released faulty information, such as its initial explanation that the website's main problem was too much traffic by an eager public. As the administration's emergency \"tech surge\" began to salvage the failing site, HHS pivoted sharply, holding near-daily conference calls with reporters to update repair progress.\n\nData disclosure continued to lag, however; the administration refused to release any figures for more than two months. In December, it began giving detailed monthly reports. Those stopped after May and the close of the regular enrollment season\u2014until the brief flawed announcement from Tavenner before a congressional panel in September.\n\n\"A mistake was made in calculating the number of individuals with effectuated Marketplace enrollments. While there were 7.3 million effectuated enrollments, approximately 393,000 individuals had both Marketplace medical and dental coverage as of August 15, 2014,\" Tavenner noted in her letter to Issa. The mistake was repeated in a November update. CMS now says 6.7 million had private Obamacare coverage as of Oct. 15.\n\nThe agency does have highly detailed enrollment data for other health programs it oversees, including Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug coverage for seniors. However, Capitol Street Managing Director Ipsita Smolinski said, \"It's kind of apples and oranges\" to compare data from the exchanges and those programs.\n\nYet if that kind of information was public for Obamacare, data discrepancies like the one that emerged Thursday would be more easily identified, said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"This could raise broader questions about whether detailed enrollment data by insurer and plan should be made public or kept confidential because it is proprietary,\" he said.\n\nHowever, it took some time before such detailed data became available for the Medicare prescription drug program, and the federal system handling Obamacare is not even finished. \"I don't think it's sinister,\" Betsy Imholz, special projects director at Consumers Union, said. \"I just think it's so complex and evolving; I just think we're at the beginning of the process.\"",
    " Title: MGM Resorts, Las Vegas Shooting Victims Reach Settlement Worth $735 Million to $800 Million\n\nArticle:\n\nMGM Resorts International and the victims of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting have reached a settlement worth between $735 million and $800 million, according to a statement by MGM on Thursday. The settlement is not an admission of liability for the shooting that left 58 dead and hundreds wounded or injured.\n\n\"Our goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process,\" said Jim Murren, chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts. \"This agreement with the Plaintiffs' Counsel is a major step, and one that we hoped for a long time would be possible.\"\n\nRobert Eglet, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said the agreement marks a milestone in the recovery process. \"While nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,\" Eglet said.\n\nThe gunman, a 64-year-old reclusive gambler, sprayed bullets on a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, which is owned and operated by MGM Resorts. He fired for between 10 to 15 minutes at the country music festival, killing 58 people. As many as 700 people were wounded or injured trying to escape the area.\n\nThe shooter was found dead in his hotel room with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators have not been able to determine his motive in carrying out the massacre. Police found 23 guns inside his hotel suite and discovered that he had brought more than 10 suitcases to the room over several days, authorities said. Lawsuits filed since the shooting questioned how and why the hotel did not know he was hoarding high-powered weapons and ammunition in his hotel room in the days leading up to the attack.\n\nAccording to a regulatory filing released in May, MGM said it could pay as much as $800 million for lawsuits related to the mass shooting. The document noted that the company has about $751 million in insurance coverage that can be used to help cover such costs.\n\nChelsea Romo, who lost her left eye and still has shrapnel in her right eye after being shot in the head during the shooting two years ago, said, \"To know that something good can come from something so horrible is I guess the only thing I could ask for out of all of this.\"\n\nJason McMillan, a 37-year-old Riverside County sheriff's deputy who was shot and paralyzed, said he was glad they reached a settlement. \"The scars and injuries from that night can never be erased,\" he said. \"I'm glad we could reach a resolution that allows us to put this nightmare behind us so our family can move forward and start focusing on the future.\"\n\nSteve Melanson, whose wife Rosemarie was injured in the shooting, spoke to CNN after learning of the settlement. \"We had no idea a settlement was reached until today. We're happy that they came to an agreement and settlement,\" he said. \"But no amount of money can bring the 58 people who were killed back. No amount of money can cure the extreme pain that my wife is still suffering.\"\n\nRosemarie Melanson spent 13 months in the hospital after the shooting and has had more than a dozen surgeries. Her husband said her surgeries are not over, and she has another surgery this month due to complications from being shot. \"She was shot once, but the bullet exploded inside of her, leaving her riddled with shrapnel that tore through her body. Our whole family has been on a roller-coaster that won't stop. She has another surgery scheduled this month,\" he told CNN. \"But ultimately, we are so thankful that she is alive.\"\n\nHe stressed that the path to recovery will be a life-long journey for her. \"It is not over for us. She has made wonderful progress. There are so many families. Our medical bills are in the millions, (but) fortunately, our insurance is good. It's covered most of it. But what about those who do not have insurance or good coverage? The settlement will hopefully offer a little closure to many who have suffered,\" he said.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Stance on Religious Liberty and the Little Sisters of the Poor Case\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama met with Pope Francis at the White House Wednesday, reiterating his administration's support for religious liberty. \"We stand with you in defense of religious freedom,\" Obama said, emphasizing that people are only truly free when they can practice their faith freely.\n\nHowever, the Obama administration's stance on religious liberty has been a subject of controversy, as seen in the ongoing legal battle with the Little Sisters of the Poor. A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the religious order must comply with the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate, which requires their health insurance carriers to subsidize contraceptive and some abortion services for employees or face fines from the IRS.\n\nThe ruling by a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver is a setback for the Little Sisters, a global Catholic order with U.S. headquarters in Catonsville that has cared for the elderly poor since 1868. The order argues that the HHS Mandate, a provision of the Affordable Care Act, infringes on its First Amendment rights by compelling it to support practices that violate its core religious beliefs.\n\n\"Today the 10th Circuit ruled that government can force the Little Sisters to either violate their faith or pay massive IRS penalties,\" lead attorney Mark Rienzi said in a statement. \"We're disappointed in today's decision.\"\n\nIn a separate matter, the administration has faced criticism for its response to the human-rights crisis in Syria and Iraq, where Christians and other religious minorities have been targeted by extremist groups. The situation in these regions has been compared to the darkest episodes of World War II, with ISIS and other Islamist extremists waging genocide against Christians, Yazidis, Mandaeans, and other defenseless religious minorities.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, ISIS launched its caliphate from Mosul, marking Christian homes with the red letter \"N,\" for \"Nazarene,\" before confiscating them and exiling their owners. Since then, ISIS has pursued Christians and other minorities with a systematic intensity, aiming to erase all traces of their ancient presence. Christians and Yazidis have been beheaded, enslaved, abducted and sold, forcibly converted to Islam, and stripped of all their property. Their houses of worship and cultural artifacts have been expropriated or demolished.\n\nIn response to a question about President Obama's stance on abortion, it is unavailable as the article does not provide information on the Pope's awareness of President Obama's views on the matter.",
    " Title: Historical Investigations into Police Misconduct and Reform Efforts in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe history of police misconduct in the United States has been marked by several significant investigations, the first of which was undertaken by the Lexow Committee in 1894. The most common complaint against the police at that time was \"clubbing,\" or the routine use of nightsticks or blackjacks to physically assault citizens.\n\nThe Wickersham Commission, established in 1931 to study the criminal justice system and examine Prohibition enforcement, provided a critical assessment, including evidence of brutal interrogation tactics. The commission attributed these practices to a lack of professionalism within the police force.\n\nFollowing the 1967 urban uprisings, the Kerner Commission found that police actions were the final incidents before the outbreak of violence in 12 out of 24 surveyed disorders. The commission's report suggested measures such as building community support for law enforcement and reviewing police operations in urban areas to ensure proper conduct by officers.\n\nDespite these commissions and subsequent calls for reform, incidents of police violence have persisted. Examples include the brutal police beating of Rodney King in 1991, the subsequent rebellion, and the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The final report of the Obama administration's President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing resulted in procedural changes like implicit-bias training, police-community listening sessions, and slight alterations to use-of-force policies and systems for identifying potentially problematic officers early on.\n\nHowever, even a member of the task force, Tracey Meares, noted in 2017 that \"policing as we know it must be abolished before it can be transformed.\" The underlying philosophy of these reforms is that stricter rules will lead to less violence, but police officers continue to break these rules. Recent events have seen police officers slashing tires, shoving elderly individuals on camera, and arresting and injuring journalists and protesters. These officers face minimal repercussions, as evidenced by the case of Daniel Pantaleo, a former New York City police officer whose chokehold led to Eric Garner's death. Despite the incident being filmed, Pantaleo remained on the job for five more years.",

The plan also includes new requirements for states to submit plans demonstrating how they will meet net-zero emissions targets.\n\nThe plan calls for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deeply integrate climate considerations into natural gas-related decisions. It also proposes new financial support and requirements for low-carbon buildings codes and infrastructure.\n\nThe plan includes vastly stronger vehicle emissions rules and support for electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. A \"buy clean program\" is also proposed to promote the decarbonization of energy-intensive manufacturing.\n\nThe plan mandates significant methane emissions cuts for the oil-and-gas industry. It also proposes the creation of a \"National Climate Bank\" to stimulate investment in low-carbon technology deployment.\n\nEnergy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone signaled that Democrats are aiming to establish the groundwork for potential legislation if they gain control of Washington in the 2020 elections. Pallone expressed pessimism about Republican support for an aggressive bill, stating, \"There\u2019s a fundamental problem here which I would be crazy not to acknowledge, which is most of them are climate deniers.\"\n\nYesterday's unveiling showed lawmakers collaborating with outside groups to align on the same page. The plan received supportive statements from groups including the Center for American Progress.\n\nCarbon pricing is not a central focus of the plan, with no explicit tax or fee included, and no large federal cap-and-trade system. However, the plan allows power companies to \"buy and trade clean energy credits from one another or purchase them via auction.\"\n\nThe plan notes that states who do not submit or receive approval for net-zero plans will be \"automatically subject to a backstop carbon fee.\" The plan also credits nuclear power and fossil generation with carbon capture in the \"clean electricity standard.\"\n\nSome advocates, such as the upstart Sunrise Movement, have criticized the plan for not going far enough, with Sunrise's Lauren Maunus stating, \"It falls short of the scale and scope of action the U.S. must take to tackle the dual crises of climate change and skyrocketing inequality.\" The group Friends of the Earth has also criticized the plan.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Accelerates Resolution of Title IX Complaints Against Colleges and Universities\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Education Department under President Donald Trump is resolving Title IX gender-discrimination complaints against universities and colleges at a significantly faster pace than during the Obama administration, according to federal data. The administration's desire to expedite these investigations, which often involve alleged sexual assaults on campus, reflects years of protest from universities and some conservative groups that the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama was using individual assault cases to open broad, years-long investigations into university practices.\n\nUnder President Obama, Title IX complaints that closed between 2010 and 2016 remained open an average of 150 days. In 2017, when President Trump took office, the average length of an open complaint was 88 days. Cases opened in the first four months of this year were resolved after an average of 39 days.\n\nIn 2010, the average number of days for the Department of Education to resolve Title IX complaints against colleges and universities was:\n- Trump in office: 200 days\n- Obama in office: 150 days\n- 2011: 150 days\n- 2012: 150 days\n- 2013: 78 days\n- 2014: 150 days\n- 2015: 150 days\n- 2016: 150 days\n\nLast year, the Education Department under Secretary Betsy DeVos opted to end an Obama-administration practice of broadening individual student's complaints to look for systemic issues in how schools were handling sexual assault and harassment. Schools often complained the inquiries were excessive or unfair.\n\nCivil-rights advocates disagreed, saying Mr. Obama's more expansive approach drilled to the root of discrimination. The current practice of closing cases as quickly as possible, they said, risks overlooking systemic violations that may be affecting more than one student.\n\nCatherine Lhamon, who headed the Education Department's civil rights office in Mr. Obama's second term, said the only times the department opened broader cases were for high-profile investigations involving Michigan State University and the University of Southern California. Both cases featured much-publicized medical faculty members accused of assaulting numerous patients.\n\nMs. Lhamon said those cases reflect a broader reality that sexual harassment exists widely on campuses, and that one person's case can shed light on whether the university has mishandled similar situations.\n\n\"That's a red flag that if you don't look, someone else will be harmed,\" Ms. Lhamon said. \"So why would the department that is charged with preventing harm against every student, why would you think, 'We don't need to look?'\"\n\nThe data, released to The Wall Street Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, contain all Title IX complaints against colleges and universities between 2010 and early May of this year.\n\nUnder President Trump's administration, the percentage of investigations ending in resolution agreements, which lay out policy changes for the institution and include a monitoring period, also fell. Nearly one in 12 cases ended in resolution agreements during President Obama's tenure, compared with closer to one in 50 under President Trump.\n\nMost complaints that didn't reach resolution agreements were dismissed, though the Trump administration has also dismissed a higher number of cases, the Journal found. More than 90% of the cases since 2017 have been dismissed, while in the six years prior, that figure was closer to 67%.\n\nThe Education Department can dismiss a case because the department determines it lacks jurisdiction or if it finds the allegation fails to state a violation, lacks sufficient detail, or is speculative or incoherent. The Journal's data don't indicate the justification for individual case dismissals.\n\nLiz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman, said resolving complaints without long delays is a priority for the Office for Civil Rights.\n\n\"Part of what makes OCR's mission meaningful is that OCR weighs in on crucial civil-rights issues in a timely way,\" she said. \"Without an effort at timely resolution, a student complaining of civil-rights violations in, say, middle school might not get an answer from OCR until he or she has graduated from high school.\"\n\nThe administration has more broadly been looking to change the department's approach to enforcement of Title IX, the 1970s-era law prohibiting gender discrimination in educational settings. In September, Mrs. DeVos rescinded a controversial Obama-era policy that directed schools to use a standard of evidence that was less rigorous than some schools had been employing. The standard, known as \"preponderance of the evidence,\" meaning simply \"more likely than not,\" is the typical standard applied in civil-rights lawsuits; however, some due-process advocates said that standard made it too easy for schools to find an accused person guilty. The administration hopes to release its own set of rules as early as September, and Education Department officials may mandate a higher standard of evidence, according to people familiar with their conversations.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Taps Law Professor Maya Harris to Lead Policy Team, Focuses on Women of Color Voting Bloc\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, announced a trio of policy advisors for her campaign on Tuesday. Two of the appointees, Jake Sullivan and Ann O'Leary, were expected, having served in Clinton's previous roles. The third member, Maya Harris, is a law professor and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who has written extensively about the growing political influence of women of color.\n\nIn her paper titled \"Women of Color: A Growing Force in the American Electorate,\" Harris argues that politicians and political strategists should address the concerns of women of color as a distinct voting bloc, rather than as part of broader efforts aimed at women, youth, or specific racial or ethnic groups. Harris contends that women of color are a rapidly growing voting bloc and that any politician who wants to win them needs to prioritize their interests on the policy agenda.\n\nThe paper does not delve into specific policy proposals, but Harris's basic political theory could signal how Clinton's campaign might attempt to replicate the coalition that propelled President Barack Obama to victory in 2008. The paper highlights the increasing political power of women of color, noting that they represent 74 percent of the growth in eligible women voters since 2000.\n\nThe paper also includes a chart that illustrates the high voter turnout rates among women, with African-American women voting at higher rates than any other demographic. This suggests that Clinton's campaign may focus on policies that appeal to women, particularly women of color, to drive high turnout in the 2016 election.\n\nIn contrast to Obama's approach, Clinton's campaign may emphasize policies that directly address the concerns of women, rather than focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups. While Obama sought to avoid proposing policy specifically aimed at the African-American community, Clinton's position is different due to the demographic makeup of the electorate. A majority of the electorate is female, and a majority of voters of color are female. If Clinton manages to polarize the electorate perfectly along gender lines, she would win the election, even if every man voted for her opponent.\n\nIn hiring Maya Harris to help lead policy on her campaign, Clinton may be signaling her intention to prioritize the concerns of women of color and to develop policies that appeal to this growing voting bloc. Harris's paper provides a roadmap for Clinton to engage with and mobilize women of color, who are poised to play a significant role in future elections.",
    " Title: Oprah Winfrey's Potential 2020 Presidential Run Gains Momentum Following Golden Globes Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nOprah Winfrey's longtime partner, Stedman Graham, has indicated that Winfrey would consider a presidential bid if called upon. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Graham stated, \"She would absolutely do it.\" This comment has further fueled speculation that Winfrey is seriously contemplating a presidential run.\n\nThe NBC network and numerous celebrities have referred to Winfrey as \"our future president\" following her powerful speech at the Golden Globes, which addressed civil rights and the #MeToo movement, highlighting rampant sexual harassment. The iconic talk show host was also the subject of a joke by the award's host, Seth Meyers, who playfully discouraged her from running for U.S. president.\n\nWinfrey's acceptance of the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the first ever awarded to a black woman, and her subsequent speech about the Me Too and civil rights movement, has sparked widespread speculation about her political aspirations. In her speech, Winfrey stated, \"For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up. Their time is up.\"\n\nLiberal MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted, \"Switched back to the Golden Globes to watch Oprah get her award. Never let it be said that I don't respect the president of the United States.\" Multiple other commentators and celebrities have also expressed their support for Winfrey's potential presidential run in 2020.\n\nAfter paying tribute to civil rights and the press, Winfrey concluded her speech with a hopeful note that \"a new day was on the horizon\" because of people who will \"take us to the time when nobody ever has to say'me too' again.\"",
    " Title: China Demands Release of Huawei CFO Amidst US Probe, Global Market Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nChina is demanding the release of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of telecoms giant Huawei, who has been detained in Canada. Meng, the daughter of the company's founder, could face extradition to the US, where she is under investigation for potential violations of US sanctions against Iran.\n\nMeng was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December, but the news was not made public at her request. The charges against her remain unknown. Huawei, one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passed Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung.\n\nThe arrest has caused a significant impact on global markets, with European shares hitting a two-year low and indexes across Asia dropping sharply following the arrest. Analysts attribute this to revived worries over the US-China trade war. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson stated, \"The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights.\"\n\nBeijing has made solemn representations to Canada and the US, demanding that both parties immediately clarify the reasons for the detention and release the detainee to protect her legal rights. Concerns that the arrest would affect the 90-day tariff truce negotiated between the two nations at the G20 have not yet materialized, as China announced on Thursday that it would \"immediately\" implement the measures agreed.\n\nThe arrest coincides with moves to restrict the use of Huawei technology in Western countries. The US, Australia, and New Zealand have blocked the use of the Chinese firm's equipment in infrastructure for new faster 5G mobile networks. Canada's ministry of justice has set a bail hearing for Meng for Friday.\n\nThe arrest is a top trending topic on Chinese social media, with many users criticizing the US and Canada for what they call \"low\" and \"bullying\" tactics. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control.\n\nThe US has brought a number of legal cases against Chinese technology firms, with accusations such as cyber-security theft and violations of Iran sanctions. Donald Trump last month reinstated all the US sanctions on Iran that had been removed under a 2015 nuclear deal. Mr. Trump had been fiercely opposed to the deal, which saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.",
    " Title: Trump's \"America First\" Policy: A Shift in U.S. Foreign Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe inaugural address of President Donald Trump has sparked concerns worldwide regarding a potential shift in American foreign policy. While the flurry of executive orders and Cabinet nominations has been encouraging to conservative skeptics, the foreign-policy section of the address has received less attention but deserves significant scrutiny.\n\nIn his speech, Trump outlined a world in which foreign relations are viewed as a zero-sum game, with other countries gaining at America's expense. He stated, \"For many decades, we\u2019ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while depleting our own.\"\n\nTrump's foreign-policy stance differs significantly from previous administrations. Unlike John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, which pledged to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the success of liberty, Trump makes no distinction between friend and foe. He declared, \"From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America First.\"\n\nThis phrase, \"America First,\" has historical implications, as it was the name of the organization led by Charles Lindbergh that advocated for American neutrality during World War II. While Trump may not have intentionally imitated Lindbergh, the phrase and its connotations have not gone unnoticed abroad.\n\nCritics argue that Trump's \"America First\" policy is a reassertion of American exceptionalism. However, it is more accurately described as the antithesis of American exceptionalism, as it makes America no different from other countries that define themselves by blood-and-soil nationalism.\n\nSome suggest that Trump's policy is a bargaining chip to negotiate better terms of trade or alliance. Others argue that Trump's views are unstable, citing his conflicting statements about NATO. However, these claims are demonstrably wrong, as an inaugural address is not an off-the-cuff riff but a carefully crafted expression of the president's philosophy.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" policy is not just theory. The abrupt withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a significant first fruit of his foreign-policy doctrine, demonstrates this shift. The prime minister of Singapore, who knows the region well, warned that if the U.S. pulled out of TPP, \"you\u2019ll be finished in Asia.\"\n\nFor 70 years, the U.S. has sustained an international system of open commerce and democratic alliances that has enabled America and the West to grow and thrive. Abandoning this global leadership at our peril is a concern shared by many.",
    " Title: \"Call for Caution Regarding Marco Rubio's Political Strategy Amidst Controversy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent headlines surrounding Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) have raised concerns among conservative supporters, with accusations of political maneuvering and alleged collaboration with Democrats on immigration reform. The controversy stems from a series of headlines published by conservative media outlets such as Breitbart.com, RedState.com, The Daily Caller, and the Washington Examiner, as well as comments from prominent conservative thought leaders.\n\nThe headlines in question include:\n\n* \"Obama Plans Major Push for Gang of Eight Immigration Bill\"\n* \"Secret Emails: Cato, Norquist, Rubio Use Boston Terror Attacks to Push Immigration Reform\"\n* \"Pro-Immigration Reform Consultants Work Together to Craft Immigration Testimony, Attack Jim DeMint and Heritage Foundation\"\n* \"They Lied to Us Then About Immigration, They are Lying Now\"\n\nThese headlines, along with National Review's Rich Lowry's recent piece, have led to accusations that Rubio and his staff are undermining the conservative cause and collaborating with Democrats. The controversy has also led to allegations of Rubio being used as a \"conservative Hispanic human shield\" by Democrat mastermind Chuck Schumer.\n\nIn a recent open letter, the author expressed concern that Rubio would become involved with a \"gang of liberals and RINOs,\" anticipating this would be the outcome. The fallout for Rubio has been more severe than anticipated, with Rubio's staff contributing to the controversy through actions such as Alex Conant's Twitter spat with a skeptical conservative reporter. Conant's comments, which tacitly labeled those who support policies that benefit law-keepers and taxpayers as racists, created an uproar on the Right.\n\nThe controversy has led some to question Rubio's political future and his ability to effectively represent conservative values on a national stage. The author of the article urges Rubio to take heed of the criticism and exercise caution in his political strategy moving forward.",
    " Title: Iowa Republican State Convention Marked by Disagreements and Calls for Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa Republican State Convention on Saturday was marked by disagreements and calls for unity, with some longtime party activists expressing concerns about the influence of Texas Representative Ron Paul's supporters. The event took place before the national convention in Florida this summer, and the rancor observed in Iowa may indicate potential challenges for Mitt Romney during the national convention.\n\nThe day was filled with parliamentary threats and disputes over speaking out of turn. The unrest can be attributed to the significant presence of Paul supporters, who will make up all but a handful of Iowa's 28 delegates going to Tampa. Out of the 25 delegates up for a vote at the convention, 21 support Paul. These delegates are unbound, meaning they can vote for whomever they choose at the national convention.\n\nBethany Gates, a delegate from Benton County, expressed concerns that aligning with Paul could harm the party's image and the state's first-in-the-nation caucus status. \"So far, we've already had two different candidates that are declared a winner,\" she said. \"If we go to national with a third candidate... we are going to look ridiculous.\"\n\nThe controversy stems from party officials reporting that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the caucus in January, only to later name former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum the winner after a recount. Paul came in a close third, but his supporters have continued to organize on his behalf.\n\nSaturday's event also included calls for unity from several speakers, including longtime Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley and State Party Chairman A.J. Spiker. Grassley urged the crowd to deliver the swing state to Romney, stating, \"Either it's four more years of President Obama, or it's a new day. And every one of you want it to be a new day.\"\n\nDespite calls for unity, Spiker, who left the Paul campaign to assume his new role earlier this year, failed to mention Romney's name during his speech. Prominent blogger Craig Robinson, who was undecided during caucus season, stated that the outcome of the convention does not represent what happened at the caucuses and is not helping the Iowa GOP.\n\nJeff Taylor, a Paul supporter who was chosen as a national delegate this weekend, argued that internal disagreements could be beneficial for the party. \"We'd have a bigger audience for the conventions if we were a little bit more of a throwback to the old days, before it was all so cut-and-dried and... a slick package,\" he said.\n\nIf Paul supporters have their way, the convention in Tampa may be anything but the slick package Romney and much of the GOP are hoping for.",
    " Title: Canadian House of Commons Unanimously Rebukes President Trump's Criticism of Prime Minister Trudeau\n\nArticle: The Canadian House of Commons unanimously passed a motion on Monday, rejecting \"disparaging ad hominem statements\" from U.S. officials, a clear reference to President Donald Trump and his advisers. The motion was proposed by MP Tracey Ramsey, a member of the New Democratic Party, in response to President Trump's criticism of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the weekend.\n\nThe rebuke came after President Trump criticized Prime Minister Trudeau for vowing to retaliate against tariffs recently imposed by the U.S. on Canadian steel and aluminum products. In a press conference on Saturday, Mr. Trudeau stated, \"I have made it very clear to the president that it is not something we relish doing, but it is something that we absolutely will do, because Canadians, we\u2019re polite, we\u2019re reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around.\"\n\nPresident Trump responded to Mr. Trudeau on Twitter, calling him \"dishonest\" and \"weak.\" The president's surrogates also amplified the attack during media appearances over the weekend. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said, \"There\u2019s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door.\"\n\nIn addition to rejecting the insults aimed at Mr. Trudeau, the motion passed on Monday also stated that lawmakers \"strongly oppose the illegitimate tariffs imposed by the U.S. government against Canadian steel and aluminum workers\" and \"stand in solidarity with the Government of Canada in its decision to impose retaliatory tariffs.\"\n\nMP Ramsey stated, \"At this difficult moment in our history with our U.S. neighbors, Canadians need to know that all sides of this House stand united as one.\" The symbolic House vote was held to show the solidarity and united front of Canada's Parliament against the divisive actions of the president of the United States after his visit to Canada and the G-7 meetings this weekend.",
    " Title: FBI Agent's Text Suggests Lack of Evidence for Trump-Russia Collusion, According to Republican Senator\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a radio interview on Tuesday, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, revealed a text message sent by Peter Strzok, the FBI's top agent on the Trump-Russia investigation, that suggests he saw no evidence of Trump campaign collusion.\n\nDuring the interview with WISN-Milwaukee radio host Jay Weber, Johnson read aloud a May 19, 2017 text that Strzok sent to Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and his mistress. Strzok wrote, \"You and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely, I'd be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern that there's no big there there.\"\n\nJohnson stated that the text referred to the Mueller investigation, which had just begun two days earlier. Strzok joined that team but was removed in July after the Justice Department's inspector general discovered his anti-Trump text exchanges with Page.\n\nAs the FBI's deputy counterintelligence chief, Strzok was picked in July 2016 to oversee the investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government. Prior to that, he was a top investigator on the Clinton email inquiry.\n\n\"I think that's kind of jaw-dropping,\" said Johnson, a Republican, of the Strzok text. \"In other words, Peter Strzok, who was the FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division, the man who had a plan to do something because he just couldn't abide Donald Trump being president, is saying that his gut sense is that there's no big there there when it comes to the Mueller special counsel investigation.\"\n\nThe text message was included in 400 pages of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page. Lawmakers have started reviewing the trove of documents for evidence of anti-Trump and pro-Clinton bias.\n\nJohnson also addressed the revelation last Friday that the FBI \"failed to preserve\" five months worth of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page. A Justice Department official told Johnson's committee and five other congressional panels that a \"misconfiguration\" issue caused \"many\" FBI-issued mobile devices to not back up to the bureau's servers.\n\nThe FBI said it does not have text messages for Strzok and Page for the period between Dec. 14, 2016, and May 17, 2017\u2014the day that Mueller was appointed. Johnson stated that Congress needs to see the missing text messages because Strzok and Page were \"completely unguarded in their communication.\"\n\n\"So we're getting insight into exactly what is happening inside the FBI at the highest levels,\" he said. \"And who knows who else they might implicate in terms of corruption.\"\n\nJohnson released two pages of Strzok-Page messages from May 19, 2017. They show the pair seemingly discussing the new Mueller investigation and whether they wanted to join. The messages show that Strzok and Page discussed the historical significance of the investigation and its potential impact on their career trajectory.\n\nThe messages also reveal Strzok's apparent attempt to coax Page into joining the Mueller investigation, with Strzok stating that it was \"maybe the most important case of our lives.\" Strzok then appeared to express his desire to \"fix\" and \"finish\" the Clinton investigation, which was referred to as \"MYE\" in the texts.\n\n\"You shouldn't take this on,\" Page then wrote. \"I promise you, I would tell you if you should.\" After several exchanges discussing their positions at the FBI, Strzok suggested to Page that he did not want to take on the Mueller job because of his \"gut sense and concern there's no big there there.\"",
    " Title: House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Issues Subpoenas in Multiple Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), has issued subpoenas to several government departments as part of ongoing investigations.\n\nOn August 8th, the committee issued a subpoena to the Treasury Department for hundreds of thousands of pages of documents related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative groups, including any communications between the White House and IRS or Treasury Department on the matter.\n\nOn August 7th, Issa sent two subpoenas to the State Department for information regarding the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, were killed.\n\nThe State and Treasury departments have until August 16th to respond to Issa's subpoenas.\n\nIn addition, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, issued a subpoena as part of the committee's probe into the \"secret science\" behind the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Air Act regulations.\n\nThe IRS controversy, often dismissed by Obama and White House officials as a \"phony scandal\" due to progressive groups also being targeted, has continued to be a point of contention for House Republicans and the Senate Finance Committee. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has received only a fraction of the more than 600,000 pages of documents related to the IRS scandal.\n\nThe Benghazi controversy is also ongoing, with Issa's panel already receiving access to 25,000 pages of Benghazi documents from the State Department. However, these documents are not allowed to be retained by congressional investigators. Since May, Issa has issued four document subpoenas to the State Department seeking additional information, with more subpoenas seeking testimony from department officials.\n\n\"After ignoring requests for months, the State Department has left no alternative but to issue subpoenas for documents relevant to our investigation,\" Issa said on August 7th. \"State Department tactics to delay and impede accountability have exhausted the Committee's patience. Further subpoenas may also be necessary if the Department is not forthcoming on other requests.\"\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is currently involved in a legal battle with the Justice Department over the Fast and Furious scandal, in which thousands of U.S.-made guns were allowed to \"walk\" to Mexican drug cartels as part of a botched investigation into weapons trafficking. The House approved civil and criminal contempt resolutions against Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to comply with a subpoena issued as part of the probe. The Justice Department refused to enforce the criminal contempt resolution against Holder. The House committee then sued the Justice Department in August 2012 in federal court to enforce the civil contempt resolution, a case that is still pending.\n\nIssa, a critic of President Obama, complained in a Friday letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that the IRS has \"engaged in a systematic effort to delay, frustrate, impede, and obstruct the Committee's investigation.\"\n\nThe Science, Space and Technology Committee, chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith, has unsuccessfully sought information from the EPA since September 2011 outlining how it determines allowable levels of airborne pollutants. Smith is demanding that the EPA turn over by August 19th unreleased public health studies conducted by Harvard University and the American Cancer Society, which the EPA used in developing regulations on particulate matter and ozone.\n\nDemocrats on the Science Committee mocked the GOP's efforts, saying they were clearly done at the behest of special-interest groups. \"I have to assume you'll be passing this data to, excuse my language, industry hacks,\" said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), ranking member of the Science panel. \"To so blatantly be doing the bidding of polluting industries is simply mind-boggling.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Shift: From \"Bad Cop\" to \"Good Cop\" with New Appointees\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, during his first 15 months in office, has been characterized as the \"bad cop\" in international relations, with his tough rhetoric and aggressive actions towards NATO allies, North Korea, Syria, and China. However, with the appointment of a team of foreign policy hardliners, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, there is a possibility that Trump may shift his role to the \"good cop.\"\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump's supposedly more sober and judicious appointees, such as former national-security adviser H.R. McMaster and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, have played the role of the \"good cop\" to Trump's \"bad cop.\" This dynamic is reminiscent of the Nixon-Kissinger relationship, where Nixon postured as the aggressive leader, while Kissinger negotiated behind the scenes to secure compromises.\n\nThe new team of foreign policy hardliners is expected to question the status quo and take risks in restoring U.S. strategic deterrence. Trump's shift to the \"good cop\" role could mean that he will no longer worry the Europeans, frighten the North Koreans, and assail the Russians and Chinese. Instead, he may express his fears that he can scarcely control the righteous anger of his new foreign-policy team.\n\nTrump ran on avoiding entangling overseas interventions, and his new role as the \"good cop\" may align more closely with his swing-state, blue-collar supporters. Trump's art-of-the-deal style has been to play the mediator who claims that there must be some way to find common ground between two adversaries. As a \"good cop,\" he can say to the Chinese, North Koreans, Iranians, and others, \"Let's make a deal so I don't have to call in the tough guys, who are starting to scare me as much as they scare you.\"\n\nTrump also has a special affinity for Defense Secretary James Mattis, but in the past, Mattis was stereotyped as a \"good cop\" trying to talk Trump out of aggressive actions. Now, however, Trump can join Mattis in a \"good-cop\" role, as the two pose abroad as unified voices of caution who want agreements rather than confrontations.\n\nEven in role-playing, it is wise to have Mattis and Trump on the same side. One reason Trump has a special affinity for Mattis is that his caution and reluctance to intervene abroad fit Trump's own campaign sloganeering.\n\nTrump now can outsource his lone-wolf hawkishness to new hard-liners Bolton and Pompeo, and remind enemies that his art-of-the-deal compromising is their last chance at an agreement. In sum, the tough reputations of the highly regarded Pompeo and Bolton now allow Trump to be what he always was\u2014a dealmaker.",
    " Title: Obama Defends TPP Pacific Rim Free-Trade Deal, Criticizes China's Exclusion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his weekly address to the nation, U.S. President Barack Obama defended the newly concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Pacific Rim free-trade deal, which excludes China. The 12-country accord, finalized after five years of negotiations, features the strongest labor and environmental standards in history, according to Obama.\n\nThe TPP, once approved by all signatories, could be the largest regional trade pact ever. Obama stated, \"Without this agreement, competitors that do not share our values, like China, will write the rules of the global economy.\" He further added, \"They'll keep selling into our markets and try to lure companies over there, meanwhile they'll keep their markets closed to us.\"\n\nThe TPP aims to set the rules for 21st-century trade and marks one of Obama's key diplomatic and economic achievements. The deal has faced opposition from activists who argue it favors big business over consumers and governments, and US congressional leaders have already expressed reservations even before the details have been released.\n\nHillary Clinton, who, as secretary of state under Obama, promoted the negotiations aimed at sealing the TPP and is now the Democratic frontrunner in the race for the 2016 presidential election, has come out against it. Clinton said Wednesday that given what she knows about the deal, it falls short of her \"high bar\" for creating American jobs, raising wages, and advancing U.S. national security.\n\nUnder the deal, 98 percent of tariffs will be eliminated on a wide range of products, including beef, dairy products, wine, sugar, rice, horticulture, seafood, manufactured products, resources, and energy. The countries involved are the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The details of the agreement are yet to be fully disclosed.",

Calysta Wilson and Courtney Fletcher, both juniors, believe their table, which is closest to the doors, would be the first target for a potential gunman.\n\n\"We sit at the table closest to the doors,\" Calysta, 17, said during a softball game. \"In the case that you came in as a shooter and you killed the first person you saw, I would die. I would not make it.\"\n\nThe grim reality of school violence has led to a shift in conversations among many high school students, from \"This could never happen here\" to \"What do we do when this happens?\" As the persistence of mass shootings and the protocol of active shooter drills become a part of their lives, students often consider the safety of their classrooms, even running scenarios in their heads about their likelihood of getting shot.\n\nSince the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting nearly six years ago in Newtown, Connecticut, there have been more than 200 school shootings nationwide, including the recent rampage in Parkland, Florida, which inspired a youth-led movement to reform gun laws.\n\nStudents now discuss the location of doors and windows in their classrooms as risk factors, calculate escape routes, and ponder hiding spots in wide-open rooms. \"It's like the front lines of a war,\" said Emily Rubinstein, a sophomore at a New York high school. \"Being seated in front of the classroom could be what makes you live and what makes you die.\"\n\nEmily has given a great deal of thought to her safety as she moves through her school day. She considers her English classroom the safest, as it has just one door, is down a hallway that makes it hard to find, and has an unusual cutout corner with no desks. Math class, on the other hand, is where she is most exposed. She sits in the second desk of the second row, in a direct diagonal path from the door. During lockdown drills, she has learned that the safest place to be is pressed up against the wall where the door is, so that if a shooter looks into the room, it will appear empty. However, in math, she has calculated that her chances of reaching that position are low.\n\n\"I sit really, really close to the door,\" she said. \"If someone came running down the hall with a gun, I wouldn't have time.\"\n\nDespite these thoughts, Emily said these plans have not affected her schoolwork, friendships, or her extracurricular activities. \"We have all these thoughts,\" she said. \"But there's still part of my mind that's like, 'No, it couldn't happen to me.'\"\n\nMany schools have decided that it could. A 2016 report from the United States Government Accountability Office found that two-thirds of school districts conduct exercises to prepare for an active shooter. Bartlesville High School, an hour north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, has regularly held safety drills and lockdowns since 2012, when a student was arrested for making a threat against the school. In Martinsburg, West Virginia, Spring Mills High School held a \"code red\" lockdown this year without telling some teachers the event was just a drill, to make sure the staff was truly prepared.",
    " Title: Biden's Victories in Primary Elections Signal Clear Path to Democratic Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the primary elections held on March 10, 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden demonstrated a significant lead over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, setting the stage for Biden to become the Democratic Party's nominee for the 2020 presidential election. This is not due to Biden acquiring an insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders on the night of the six contests, but rather due to the expected results in upcoming states such as Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona, where Biden is expected to win by double-digit margins.\n\nThe results of the primary elections on March 10 confirm a trend that has been evident since Super Tuesday, which is that Biden is performing better than Hillary Clinton did in the 2016 primaries, while Sanders is performing significantly worse. The results in states such as Mississippi and Michigan, which played a significant role in the 2016 election, highlight this trend.\n\nIn Mississippi, Biden's showing in the primary mirrors Clinton's performance in the state four years ago, with the more centrist candidate winning with approximately 80% of the vote, while Sanders finished in the mid-teens. The ideologically moderate black vote in the South, a key demographic, appears to favor Biden over Sanders.\n\nIn Michigan, Sanders' performance in the 2016 primary, where he narrowly beat Clinton, is expected to be significantly lower this time around, with Biden on track to win by roughly 13 percentage points. Sanders' underperformance in Michigan is particularly noteworthy, as he won Kalamazoo County by 22 points in 2016, but narrowly lost it to Biden this time. In Washtenaw County, Sanders' stronghold in 2016, he lost to Biden by a narrow margin.\n\nThe results in Missouri were even more stark, with Sanders losing the state to Clinton in a photo-finish in 2016, but Biden looking on track to win it by a massive 25 points. The contrast between Sanders' 2016 and 2020 performances in these states is undeniable.\n\nEven in states where Sanders has enjoyed his greatest strength, such as Washington and Idaho, his performance is weaker this time around. In Washington, Sanders' 72% victory in the 2016 caucuses has become a neck-and-neck race with Biden, while in Idaho, Sanders' 56-point blowout in the 2016 caucuses has become a narrow lead for Biden.\n\nThe Sanders campaign's performance in these primary elections is a clear indication of a floundering and deflating campaign, while the Biden campaign, facing no other viable opponents, has become virtually unstoppable in its march to the Democratic nomination. It remains to be seen whether the former vice president will prove more capable than the 2016 nominee of beating President Donald Trump in the general election. However, the results on Tuesday night give Democrats reason to suspect that he might.",
    " Title: Obama to Announce Expanded Background Checks for Gun Sales as Part of New Executive Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to discuss options for tougher gun restrictions, and is expected to announce in the coming days a new executive action with the goal of expanding background checks on gun sales. The set of executive actions, described as \"imminent\" by people familiar with the White House plans, is expected to fulfill a promise by the President to take further unilateral steps to help curb gun deaths.\n\nPlans for the action are not yet complete, and those familiar with the process warn that unforeseen circumstances could delay an announcement. However, gun control advocates are expecting the new actions to be revealed next week, ahead of Obama's annual State of the Union address, set for January 12.\n\nThe White House would not comment directly on the exact timing or content of Obama's executive orders. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said that the President expected a set of recommendations on unilateral action to arrive at the beginning of the year. Plans began to become clearer on New Year's Day with a White House announcement accompanying Obama's weekly address, stating that on Monday the president would meet with Lynch.\n\n\"Change, as always, is going to take all of us,\" Obama said in his weekly address. \"The gun lobby is loud and well organized in its defense of effortlessly available guns for anyone. The rest of us are going to have to be just as passionate and well organized in our defense of our kids.\"\n\n\"We know that we can't stop every act of violence,\" Obama said. \"But what if we tried to stop even one? What if Congress did something -- anything -- to protect our kids from gun violence?\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Schultz said Obama was \"expressing urgency\" for a list of steps he can take on his own after high-profile incidents of gun violence at the end of this year.\n\n\"It is complicated. That's why it's taken some time for our policy folks, our lawyers, and our experts to work through this and see what's possible,\" Schultz said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association said the group had no comment. The group previously told CNN that Obama's \"gun control agenda was rejected by Congress. Now, he is doing what he always does when he doesn't get his way, defying the will of the people and using executive action.\"\n\nThe group said at the time that Obama had his \"wish list of gun control\" in California but \"it didn't prevent the San Bernardino attack.\"\n\n\"The fact is, the President's gun control agenda will only make it harder for law-abiding citizens to exercise their right to self-defense,\" said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker.\n\nGun control advocates and White House officials say the focus remains on the so-called \"gun show loophole,\" which allows certain sellers of guns -- at gun shows and elsewhere -- to avoid conducting background checks before making sales. Months after the Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school massacre that claimed 26 victims in 2012, the then-Democratic majority Senate rejected a similar proposal.\n\nCongress would still need to act in order to make background checks fully universal. However, advocates and administration lawyers have struck upon a provision in the law that could allow for Obama to expand the background check requirement to additional sellers.\n\nFederal law currently requires all individuals \"engaged in the business\" of selling guns to obtain a license and conduct background checks on buyers. However, others who only make occasional sales or are selling firearms from a personal collection are exempted from the background check requirement.\n\nGun control advocates say Obama could take action himself by issuing a regulation that provides expanded guidance on who falls under the \"in the business\" standard. One group, the Michael Bloomberg-helmed Everytown for Gun Safety, has provided recommendations to the White House that include creating a test for assessing who must become licensed to continue selling guns. Factors would include volume and speed of sales, and whether or not the seller relies on advertising to sell guns.\n\nThe group also recommended Obama define a gun in a \"personal collection\" as having been in the seller's possession for at least a year.\n\nBefore leaving for his winter vacation in Hawaii, Obama met with Bloomberg at the White House to discuss gun control.\n\nAside from the background check provision, people familiar with Obama's plans say his new gun control announcement will include new funding for government agencies to better enforce existing gun laws. Other gun control advocates are pushing the administration to set an annual sales threshold of 25 guns for a seller to be defined as \"engaged in the business\" of selling guns, and thus required to obtain a license and conduct background checks. That would be one of several factors used to determine whether or not a seller meets the definition of \"in the business.\" Others would include whether or not they advertise.\n\nAside from the gun-show loophole, advocates are anticipating the administration will bolster regulations on the reporting of lost and stolen guns. Currently, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is only required to investigate a gun theft if 10 or more guns are stolen and one of them is used in a crime. The administration is expected to tighten those requirements by reducing the minimum number of guns stolen that would prompt an investigation, and potentially eliminating the requirement that one of the guns is used in a crime.",
    " Title: Mississippi Elementary School Renamed in Honor of Barack Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nParents and children in Mississippi have chosen to rename an elementary school serving predominantly black students in honor of the first black president, Barack Obama. The Davis International Baccalaureate (IB) Elementary School in Jackson will be renamed as such at the start of the 2018-19 school year.\n\nThe name change was approved by school stakeholders in a vote held on October 5, as announced by PTA President Janelle Jefferson at a Tuesday evening meeting of the district's board of trustees. According to Jefferson, the school community sought a name that reflects a person who embodies ideals and public stances consistent with what they want their children to believe about themselves.\n\nDiscussions to rename the magnet school from one honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis began in August. More than 95% of the school's students are black. PTA president Jefferson stated, \"Jefferson Davis, although infamous in his own right, would probably not be too happy about a diverse school promoting the education of the very individuals he fought to be enslaved named after him.\"\n\nAs part of a three-week process, staff and students at the school offered suggestions for new names and then held a vote. Board President Camille Simms expressed her agreement with the new name at Tuesday's meeting. School board member Jed Oppenheim applauded the school for taking the initiative, stating, \"I think this is a powerful narrative.\"\n\nPTA president Jefferson told the Associated Press they would conduct \"some very aggressive fundraising campaigns\" to pay for new signs and stationery with Obama's name.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Health Care Decision Alters Public Perception of the High Court\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to uphold the national health care law has not significantly changed opinions on the controversial measure, but it has noticeably affected Americans' views of the high court, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll.\n\nThe poll, released on Monday, shows that 50% of Americans agree with the Supreme Court's decision, while 49% disagree. The partisan divide is evident, with 80% of Democrats agreeing with the decision, 80% of Republicans disagreeing, and independent voters split, with 52% disagreeing and 47% agreeing.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Thursday through Sunday, entirely after the high court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act. CNN Polling Director Keating Holland notes that, despite the expected partisan divide, only about one in five Americans (20%) and only 35% of Republican rank and file are angry about the decision. Similarly, only 16% of Americans, and only one in three Democrats, feel enthusiastic about the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, perceptions of the high court have changed significantly. \"As recently as April, Republicans and Democrats had virtually identical positive opinions on the Supreme Court,\" Holland says. \"But that's no longer the case. That's the biggest change that the court decision has created.\"\n\nThe court's approval rating among Democrats jumped by 23 points, to 73%. Among Republicans, it fell by 21 points, to 31%. Approval of the Supreme Court among independents edged up five points, to 53%.\n\nOpinions of Chief Justice John Roberts are also divided along partisan lines, with a majority of Democrats holding a favorable view of him compared to only 30% of Republicans. However, more than a third of all Americans (35%) are unsure how they view Roberts, probably a result of the low profile that he and his colleagues have kept for many years. Roberts sided with the liberals on the high court to uphold the law.\n\nOverall, 30% say the high court is too liberal, with 22% saying it's too conservative and 46% saying it's about right.\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives has scheduled a July 11th vote to attempt to repeal the health care law. The survey indicates that 51% say Congress should repeal all provisions of the measure, with 47% saying no.\n\nRegarding the individual mandate itself, 48% favor it and 51% oppose the mandate. One thing that Americans do agree on is that the health insurance mandate is a tax, as ruled by the Supreme Court. Six in ten feel that way.\n\n\"But it is also worth noting that the number of Americans who favor all or most of the provisions in the bill has gone up a bit since last year,\" Holland says. \"Despite roughly half looking to repeal all the provisions in the law, only one in eight say they oppose everything in the bill.\"\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from June 28-July 1 with 1,517 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.\n\nDo you agree or disagree with Thursday's Supreme Court ruling? Share your thoughts in the comments below.",
    " Title: Michael Flynn's Aborted Nuclear Deal with Saudi Arabia and Russia: A Failed Plan for Strategic Security\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Flynn, former National Security Advisor, was involved in a proposed nuclear deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia during the Obama administration. The deal, which never materialized, was not primarily aimed at generating energy but rather securing strategic alliances, according to Thomas Cochran, a nuclear nonproliferation proponent involved with the Advanced Clean Energy (ACU) project.\n\nThe plan, as outlined by Cochran, would have seen the Saudis and other Arab states purchasing a security arrangement involving the U.S., Russia, France, and the U.K., with the ultimate goal of compensating Russia for lost military sales to Iran. The deal was intended to encourage Russia to decrease its support for Iran, in exchange for substantial financial gains not only from nuclear deals but also from arms sales.\n\nThe proposed deal, had it been implemented, would have provided a significant financial boost to the U.S. nuclear industry and Russia, potentially saving an industry struggling to find willing customers domestically and abroad. However, the deal faced obstacles during the Obama administration, including Russian sanctions and the ongoing Iran treaty negotiations, which would have been disrupted by the proposed plan.\n\nFlynn's deal with Russia was not disclosed during his tenure as National Security Advisor, adding to a growing list of reporting failures. These failures extended beyond his alleged undisclosed associations with former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, which reportedly led to his dismissal. Flynn also failed to disclose his extensive dealings with the Turkish government, dinner with Vladimir Putin, income from Russian state media, payments from a Russian cybersecurity firm, and a researcher's work with Russian hackers.\n\nDespite these undisclosed connections, the Trump administration initially ignored them. However, with the investigation by the Special Counsel and the Senate Intelligence Committee, the significance of Flynn's omissions has become a major issue.",
    " Title: Texas Senator Ted Cruz Supports Texas Senate Bill 1, Aimed at Limiting Abortions After 20 Weeks\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has publicly expressed his support for Texas Senate Bill 1, a controversial legislation that aims to ban abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and raise the standards of care at abortion clinics by requiring them to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Cruz expressed gratitude to the thousands of Texans who are engaging in the legislative process to advocate for the unborn. He cited the recent murder trial of abortionist Kermit Gosnell as a compelling reason for the need for action.\n\nSen. Cruz criticized those who advocate for few restrictions on abortion, stating that their position can be interpreted as supporting \"anytime, on-demand, and everywhere\" abortions. He emphasized the importance of the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, arguing that life comes first.\n\nOver the past week, Sen. Cruz has reflected on the Founding Fathers, the Declaration of Independence, and the concept of natural rights. He suggested that the Founding Fathers would find legalized infanticide abhorrent and unconscionable. He noted that, in many states, women can terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, which he finds problematic given the understanding of fetal pain.\n\nSen. Cruz asserted that liberty and late-term abortion cannot co-exist, and while most Americans understand this, far too many do not. He concluded by stating that the bill in Texas, which pro-lifers are championing, is not intended to harm women but to protect the unborn from agony and death.",
    " Title: U.S. Airstrikes Against Islamic State Militants: Background and Identification of Notorious ISIS Member\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States considers targeted strikes against specific militant leaders as lawful acts of war or self-defense, especially when capturing the militants is not feasible. This was evident during the U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State (IS) in 2014, which was declared as part of the existing armed conflict that Congress authorized against Al Qaeda following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The IS was a component or affiliate of Al Qaeda for years but split away due to internal disagreements.\n\nOne of the most notorious ISIS members, Mohammed Emwazi, first gained prominence in August 2014, when the IS released a video showing the beheading of journalist James Foley. Emwazi, who was initially known as an unidentified, masked man with a British accent, went on to behead another journalist, Steven J. Sotloff, in a video released two weeks later.\n\nThe Washington Post revealed Emwazi's identity in February 2015, reporting that he grew up in a well-off family that moved to Britain when he was a child and that he had studied computer science at the University of Westminster. This revelation sparked intense scrutiny of the causes of radicalization among Muslim immigrants in Europe.\n\nEmwazi was part of a group of friends, known as the \"North London Boys\" by some intelligence analysts, who prayed at the same mosque and became captivated by an Egyptian-born cleric, Hani al-Sibai. Sibai is thought to have close links to the Tunisian branch of Ansar al-Shariah, a Salafist group linked to a deadly attack in June on tourists in Tunisia.\n\nThe leader of this network was Bilal al-Berjawi, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2011 after he went to Somalia to join the Islamist group known as the Shabab. Berjawi was killed by an American drone strike the next year. Another friend, Mohamed Sakr, was also killed by a drone strike in Somalia in the same year.",
    " Title: The Impact of Ongoing Protests on the 2020 Presidential Race: A Neutral Analysis of Biden and Trump's Stances on Police Violence and Criminal Justice Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing protests against police violence and racial injustice are unfolding across the United States, accompanied by instances of looting and unrest. The impact of these events on the upcoming presidential race between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden remains uncertain.\n\nMany political analysts predict that the unrest is benefiting Mr. Biden, as they view the protests as a manifestation of widespread dissatisfaction among minority groups, which they believe will drive voters to the polls in large numbers.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the polls are still early, and their accuracy is uncertain, especially in the current lockdown environment. While President Trump has made a few missteps, such as his controversial walk across Lafayette Square to St. John's Church, some critics have also questioned the actions of the Democrats, such as their decision to kneel for nine minutes while partially dressed in traditional African garb.\n\nThe discussion surrounding the protests and police violence has largely overlooked Mr. Biden, who has made a few statements and public appearances but has not taken a more active role in addressing the issues. Some argue that Mr. Biden, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009 and as vice president for eight years, may be reluctant to discuss his role in past legislation, such as the 1994 Crime Bill, which is widely criticized for contributing to mass incarceration in the United States.\n\nPresident Trump, on the other hand, has taken a different approach, advocating for criminal justice reform and helping to pass the First Step Act, which has led to the release of people of color who were incarcerated for long periods for minor drug offenses.\n\nThe nation's views on race and crime are changing, and it remains to be seen how the two candidates will address these issues in the coming months. As the former vice president emerges from his self-imposed COVID-19 isolation, it will be interesting to see how he addresses the ongoing protests and works to bring an end to the violence, arson, and riots.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Unilateral Policy Implementation Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican party expressed optimism, perceiving President Obama's first two years in office as a period of bipartisan disregard and intentional provocation towards Republicans in order to pass progressive policies. With the GOP gaining control of a small percentage of the federal government, it was anticipated that Obama would reach across the aisle. However, the Obama Administration's approach has deviated significantly from this expectation.\n\nInstead of reforming existing laws, the Administration has opted to not enforce them. This strategy has been applied to various pieces of legislation, including the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the DREAM Act, and No Child Left Behind.\n\nA White House official stated, \"We work to achieve our policy goals in the most effective and appropriate way possible. Often times, Congress has blocked efforts [such as No Child Left Behind and DREAM Act] and we look to pursue other appropriate means of achieving our policy goals.\"\n\nOn gay rights, the administration has also asked agencies to take a less active role. In February 2011, the Justice Department announced it would not defend DOMA against court challenges, an unusual step for the agency, which typically defends legal challenges to laws on the books. This tactic has its roots in the earliest days of the administration, with the Department of Justice announcing in October 2009 that it would not prosecute medical marijuana users or suppliers in states where it is legal, despite state laws contradicting federal law.\n\nThis expansion of executive power has been met with criticism, with constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley noting that \"President Obama has fulfilled the dream of an imperial presidency that Richard Nixon strived for... this is a President who is now functioning as a super legislator.\"\n\nProgressives, who previously abhorred such expansions of executive power during the George W. Bush administration, have largely supported President Obama's unilateral power expansions, from drone strikes that kill American citizens to recess appointments made without a recess. This raises questions about the potential consequences of such powers in the hands of \"the other side.\"\n\nHypothetical scenarios, such as a Republican president announcing that his Environmental Protection Agency is going to halt enforcement of pollution regulations or a Republican's IRS not enforcing the Obamacare mandate, highlight the potential dangers of unilateral policy implementation.\n\nProgressives are encouraged to consider the implications of their support for these unprecedented expansions of executive power.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Hope for Partial or Full Overturn of 2010 Health Care Law, According to New York Times and CBS News Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by The New York Times and CBS News indicates that more than two-thirds of Americans hope the Supreme Court will overturn some or all of the 2010 health care law. The Supreme Court is expected to decide a challenge to the law by the end of this month.\n\nThe poll found that just 24 percent of respondents hoped the court would keep the entire health care law in place. Forty-one percent of those surveyed said the court should strike down the entire law, while another 27 percent said the justices should overturn only the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThese numbers have not changed much in recent months and appeared to be largely unaffected by the more than six hours of arguments in the Supreme Court in March.\n\nThere was greater Republican opposition to the law than Democratic support. About two-thirds of Republicans in the recent survey said the entire law should be overturned, while 43 percent of Democrats said all of the law should be upheld.\n\nMore than 70 percent of independent voters said they wanted to see some or all of the law struck down, with a majority saying they hoped to see the whole law overturned. Twenty-two percent of independents said they hoped the entire law would survive.\n\nResponses varied by education as well. Nearly a third of respondents with a college education said they would like to see the law upheld, compared with about 20 percent of those without a college degree.\n\nLegal scholars and political scientists are divided over whether the justices take account of public opinion in making their decisions. In a 2010 study published in The Georgetown Law Journal, Lawrence Baum of Ohio State University and Neal Devins of the College of William & Mary concluded that the justices were not much concerned with mass opinion.\n\n\"Supreme Court justices care more about the views of academics, journalists, and other elites than they do about public opinion,\" they wrote. \"This is true of nearly all justices and is especially true of swing justices, who often cast the critical votes in the court's most visible decisions.\"\n\nThe nationwide poll is based on telephone interviews conducted May 31 through June 3 on land-lines and cellphones with 976 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Blocks Enforcement of Louisiana Abortion Law, Potential Implications for Abortion Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a stay on Thursday, blocking enforcement of a Louisiana abortion law that could have nationwide implications for abortion rights. The case, June Medical Services v. Gee, concerns a 2014 Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\n\nIn September 2018, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the law to stand, breaking with Supreme Court precedent. The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, appealed to the Supreme Court and asked for a stay of the law, which was set to go into effect on February 4. Last week, Justice Samuel Alito issued an order blocking the law until Thursday.\n\nThe ruling on Thursday blocks enforcement of the law while the Court considers whether to hear the case. If the Court does hear June Medical Services v. Gee, it could be a chance for the justices to revisit and possibly overturn Roe v. Wade, a landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 to block enforcement of the Louisiana law, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the Court's four more liberal members. Justices Alito, Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch voted to allow the law to go into effect.\n\nThe ruling was a victory for abortion rights advocates, albeit a temporary one. \"The Supreme Court has stepped in under the wire to protect the rights of Louisiana women,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement to media outlets. \"The three clinics left in Louisiana can stay open while we ask the Supreme Court to hear our case.\"\n\nLaws requiring admitting privileges have proliferated around the country in recent years. Abortion opponents have argued that these laws are necessary to protect women's health, but courts have generally failed to find evidence for this. Abortion is generally a very safe procedure for the patients who undergo it, and they typically don't need to be admitted to a hospital.\n\nMoreover, abortion providers don't need to have admitting privileges for their patients to visit a hospital. As Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in an opinion striking down a Wisconsin admitting privileges law, \"A woman who experiences complications from an abortion (either while still at the clinic or at home afterward) will go to the nearest hospital, which will treat her regardless of whether her abortion doctor has admitting privileges.\"\n\nSome abortion opponents say laws like Louisiana's ensure women a seamless experience if they do suffer complications. Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that when she had an abortion herself, \"I thankfully did not have any kind of emergency there at the clinic. But had I had, I would have wanted a smooth transfer procedure in place.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the laws have resulted in abortion clinic closures, since it's often difficult for abortion providers to get hospital admitting privileges. That's a concern for opponents of the Louisiana law, which, according to Travis Tu, lead counsel on the case for the Center for Reproductive Rights, would turn Louisiana into \"an abortion desert.\" It would close at least two of the three remaining clinics in Louisiana, a state with 1 million women of reproductive age, Tu said.\n\nIn Whole Woman's Health, the Supreme Court ruled that a Texas admitting privileges law was unconstitutional, finding that it \"provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an 'undue burden' on their constitutional right to do so.\"\n\nThe Louisiana law is nearly identical to the Texas law, but in September, the Fifth Circuit upheld the Louisiana version, essentially placing itself in direct conflict with the Supreme Court. The Center for Reproductive Rights appealed, asking the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nNow that the Court has stopped enforcement of the law, it must decide whether to hear the appeal. If it decides not to take the case, the stay issued on Thursday would end automatically, and the law would go into effect. If the Court does decide to take the case, it will have to decide whether to follow the precedent set in Whole Woman's Health, striking down the Louisiana law, or reverse itself and uphold the law. In the process, it could decide to overturn the protection for abortion rights set forth in Roe v. Wade.\n\nWhole Woman's Health was decided when Justice Anthony Kennedy, typically seen as a moderate, was still on the Court. Now he's been replaced by Kavanaugh\u2014who, while he refused to directly answer questions about Roe during his confirmation hearing, is seen by advocates on both sides as a potential deciding vote to overturn the landmark abortion decision.\n\nKavanaugh issued an opinion dissenting from Thursday's decision to issue the stay. He argued that the Louisiana law should be allowed to take effect to allow abortion providers to determine if they could, in fact, obtain admitting privileges. Then, if they could not, he said, they could file another challenge to the law.\n\n\"In order to resolve the factual uncertainties presented in the stay application about the three doctors' ability to obtain admitting privileges, I would deny the stay,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I was pleased to see the dissent from Justice Kavanaugh,\" said Foster, noting that he was under no obligation to weigh in publicly.\n\n\"As Justice Kavanaugh said, the question presented to us at this time is whether the law imposes an undue burden,\" she added. \"That's the analysis he's looking towards.\"\n\nIf the Court agrees to hear June Medical Services v. Gee, advocates on both sides will be watching Kavanaugh closely, as the future of abortion law in America may be at stake.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with comments from Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life.",
    " Title: Trump's Legal Dramas and Their Impact on the Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing legal issues involving President Trump have dominated media coverage since April 30, 2018, with the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and the Southern District of New York's investigation into Trump attorney Michael Cohen's business dealings being the main focus. This coverage has been sensationalist and hyperbolic, often portraying each new development as a prelude to Trump's downfall.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Party has not benefited from Trump's legal dramas, as some might expect. On the contrary, Trump's approval rating has been on the rise, with his highest rating in a year at 44 percent in the Real Clear Politics average. Meanwhile, the Democratic advantage on the congressional generic ballot has been cut in half since December, from plus 13 points to plus 6.5 points.\n\nOne possible explanation for Trump's continued approval is the strong economy, with its positive job market and wage growth. Another is the desire for peace, as President Trump's desire to meet with Kim Jong-un of North Korea has been embraced by voters.\n\nHowever, another explanation is that the American electorate has not fundamentally changed since the Clinton presidency. The electorate still holds a \"bifurcated view\" that separates the man from his policies, and as long as the policies seem to be working, the man's opponents find themselves waiting for voters to recognize and repudiate defects of character.\n\nTrump became president despite majority personal disapproval, and his victory depended on a coalition between his devoted fans and more traditional Republican voters who, despite misgivings, supported him because they concluded that the alternative was worse personally and politically.\n\nThe incessant focus on Trump's legal issues not only occupies the attention of Democrats and the anti-Trump Resistance to the exclusion of other topics but also relieves them of any responsibility to come up with a substantive message. The voters, by contrast, read the headlines with a cursory or prurient interest as they go about their lives in the real world of work, family, community, and faith.\n\nThe tax bill passed in December, yet Trump's approval began its most recent rise in March, when he announced his first round of steel and aluminum tariffs. It is Trump's desire to combat offshoring and deindustrialization, more than the tax bill, that is galvanizing his base and strengthening his economic message.\n\nCollege-educated voters and suburban women disgusted with Trump may be enough to win the Democrats a slim House majority. However, Democrats won't find themselves in a truly commanding position until they make inroads among the Rust Belt voters who abandoned Hillary Clinton for the president. The more the party focuses on Robert Mueller and Stormy Daniels, the less likely it is to recognize the appeal of Trump's economic message and to adjust accordingly. The more the party falls for the self-flattery, empty rhetoric, question begging, and maze-like complexity of media narratives\u2014not to mention the more it succumbs to the fever-dream of impeachment\u2014the less likely it is to recoup the power it once enjoyed.",
    " Title: Representative Charlie Rangel Criticizes Tea Party, Labels Them a \"Cult\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, U.S. Representative Charlie Rangel (D-NY) expressed his criticism of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, specifically the Tea Party movement. Rangel referred to the Tea Party as a \"cult\" and described their actions as \"illness.\"\n\nDuring a speech, Rangel stated, \"Politics is changing for me at this late age, to have to deal with a cult-type of group of people.\" The congressman, who has been in office since 1971, has recently allocated millions of taxpayer dollars to a New York library named in his honor.\n\nRangel criticized the Tea Party for their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He said, \"When a handful of people can control a larger number of people, to repeal a law that has been passed by the House, the Senate, and declared constitutional by the courts - and they campaign on the issue that it should be repealed- this is past Civics 101. This is illness.\"\n\nRangel's comments have sparked controversy and criticism, with some accusing him of butchering a sense of civics and constitutional law. The individual mandate of Obamacare was ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, but there are ongoing legal challenges against the law and its regulations.\n\nRangel's statement that repealing laws is an \"illness\" has been met with criticism and has been added to the liberal-lunacy highlight reel of 2013. Some argue that supporters of Obamacare may be the ones suffering from mental illness, given their support for a law that has been criticized for its potential impact on economic vitality and individual liberty.\n\nThe Tea Party movement is often described as a collection of like-minded individuals who have banded together for political clout. Rangel's labeling of the movement as a \"cult\" has been met with criticism, as the Tea Party has not been known for using taxpayer funds to build facilities named in their honor, unlike some members of Congress.\n\nRangel's comments illustrate a growing trend in American politics, with some politicians and pundits labeling small government advocates as radical, dangerous, and mutinous to government action. The Tea Party movement has been a prominent force in American politics since the 2009 taxpayer protests, and their influence continues to be felt in the political landscape.",
    " Title: FBI Warns of Zoombombing Incidents as Zoom's Popularity Surges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a warning about using the video conferencing platform Zoom, following a series of incidents known as \"Zoombombing.\" This form of harassment involves intruders hijacking video calls and posting offensive content such as hate speech, pornography, and racial slurs.\n\nDennis Johnson, a doctoral student at California State University, Long Beach, was a victim of such an incident last week during his dissertation defense. Johnson, who was the first member of his family to graduate from college, had a large audience of around 40 people, including friends, family, classmates, and his dissertation committee.\n\nDuring his presentation, an intruder drew male genitalia on the screen, causing confusion among the participants. The attacker then scrawled a racial slur that was visible to everyone on the call. Johnson was left shaken, and the intended celebration was ruined.\n\nSimilar incidents have disrupted Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in New York, Sunday school in Texas, online classes at the University of Southern California, and a city meeting in Kalamazoo, Michigan. With schools closed and millions of people working from home, Zoom has become increasingly popular. The company reported that 200 million people used the app daily in March, up from just 10 million in December.\n\nIn response to the concerns, Zoom has taken steps to address the issues. It published a guide on how users can protect meetings and changed settings for accounts used by schools and universities to make their meetings more private by default. However, the company is currently facing scrutiny due to reported flaws in its software that could allow hackers to spy through a computer's webcam or microphone.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has sent a letter to Zoom asking about its security and privacy protections. Security researcher Patrick Wardle, who previously worked at the National Security Agency, has also turned up flaws in Zoom's software. Zoom says it has released fixes for these issues.\n\nIn a blog post, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan acknowledged the company's shortcomings and stated that they are focusing on fixing their privacy and security problems. \"We recognize that we have fallen short of the community's \u2013 and our own \u2013 privacy and security expectations,\" Yuan wrote. \"For that, I am deeply sorry, and I want to share what we are doing about it.\"",
    " Title: North Korea Agrees to Talks on Reopening Joint Industrial Complex with South Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth and South Korea have reached an agreement to hold talks on reopening the Kaesong industrial complex, a symbol of cooperation between the two nations that was shuttered in April. This marks the first step toward cooperation between the two countries since its closure.\n\nPyongyang had previously rejected all offers to discuss reopening the Kaesong industrial complex. Some observers speculate that North Korea's acquiescence now signals it is feeling dangerously isolated from China, a vital ally that has indicated frustration with North Korean intransigence and has warmed up to US-led efforts to isolate Pyongyang.\n\nAccording to the International Crisis Group's senior analyst Daniel Pinkston, during a meeting between North Korean and Chinese officials last month, China may not have been \"as generous as the North Koreans have been expecting in terms of aid, trade, and investment.\" Jo Dong Ho, a North Korean Studies professor at Ewha Womans University, stated that Chinese pressure has left the North with \"no choice but to cooperate with the South to get the economy going.\"\n\nKoh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University, suggested that Pyongyang's announcement is timed for US-China talks scheduled for later this week. Kim Yong Hyun, a Seoul-based professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University, stated that China is the \"key\" when it comes to North Korea strategies.\n\nChina has taken a tougher stance on North Korea, as the US hoped it would. It has supported tighter United Nations sanctions in response to the February nuclear test and stepped up border inspections. Most notably, a leading Chinese state bank shut accounts of North Korea\u2019s Foreign Trade Bank, its main foreign exchange institution.\n\nTwo weeks ago, China hosted a top North Korean envoy, a visit that was expedited in advance of the U.S.-China summit that starts Friday. The North has since adopted a less confrontational stance and declared a willingness to return to the negotiating table.\n\nChinese academics are more willing now to openly consider the prospect of a North Korean collapse. However, China is not taking steps that could hasten the end of the Kim regime, such as cutting supplies.\n\nIf the talks happen, they will be the first time officials from the two countries meet directly since February 2011. The North has preferred private talks through nongovernmental channels such as businessmen, but the South has been emphatic in its demands for government-to-government talks.\n\nAll outstanding issues that have strained cross-border relations will be on the table, including the disconnecting of the hotline between the North and South earlier this year. The closure of the complex came on the heels of tightened UN sanctions after North Korea's third nuclear test in February and the holding of regular US-South Korea military drills. The North pulled its 50,000 workers from the complex and blocked deliveries. South Korean workers eventually departed as well.\n\nAgreeing to talks could indicate that \"the cost of closure of Kaesong is greater than [the North] had anticipated,\" said Daniel Pinkston, according to CNN. Launched during the \"sunshine\" era of North-South engagement as a symbol of cooperation, it provides inexpensive labor for South Korean companies and critical foreign currency for isolated North Korea, largely shut out of the global financial system by sanctions.\n\n\"There's political symbolism, economic aspects, and nationalistic Pan-Korean elements wrapped up in it as well. The loss if Kaesong is not reopened is more than material,\" Pinkston said in an interview with the Guardian.",
    " Title: Senior Trump Official Anonymously Criticizes President in New York Times Op-Ed\n\nArticle:\n\nA senior official in President Donald Trump's administration has written an opinion piece in the New York Times, criticizing the President's decision-making and expressing concerns about his fitness for office. The author, who remains anonymous, describes a group of officials working to thwart parts of the President's agenda to protect the country from his \"worst impulses.\"\n\nThe official writes that there were early discussions among Cabinet members about invoking the 25th Amendment, a constitutional provision that outlines the process for removing a president who is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. However, the official states that no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis, and they are instead working to steer the administration in the right direction.\n\nThe opinion piece comes amidst a series of reports describing chaos within the White House, including excerpts from a book by famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward. Defense Secretary James Mattis reportedly rejected a recommendation from Trump for the U.S. military to kill Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to Woodward's book. Mattis dismissed the book as \"a uniquely Washington brand of literature,\" and Trump has called it \"total fiction.\"\n\nTrump himself responded to the opinion piece by calling it a \"gutless editorial\" and a \"failing\" New York Times. He also questioned whether the anonymous author was committing treason and suggested that the Times should turn the author over to the government. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is currently on a visit to India, denied authorship of the piece.\n\nThe opinion piece has fueled accusations that Trump is unstable and unfit for the presidency, and has resurrected talk among some Democrats about potentially impeaching the President should they take control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November elections. The identity of the author remains unknown, and there is speculation in Washington about whether the piece came from someone within the White House or another government agency.",
    " Title: U.S. Lawmakers Debate Military Intervention in Syria as Obama Weighs Options\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Syria's accusation that Israel, a close U.S. ally, launched rockets into the country, American lawmakers have expressed varying opinions on whether the United States should supply Syrian rebel forces with weapons.\n\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, argued that President Barack Obama should intervene militarily, stating, \"The whole situation is becoming more and more expansive, and unfortunately, the red line that the president of the United States had written was apparently written in disappearing ink.\"\n\nThe Obama administration recently acknowledged evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, a situation that Obama had previously identified as a \"red line.\" However, the president has expressed a desire to gather all the facts before taking any action.\n\nSen. McCain suggested establishing a \"safe zone\" in Syria, taking out the Syrian government's air assets, supplying the rebel forces with the necessary weapons, and avoiding American boots on the ground.\n\nRep. Peter King, former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, expressed concern that providing weapons to the rebel forces might be \"counterproductive,\" as he believes some of the rebels could end up in the wrong hands, potentially strengthening al-Qaeda elements.\n\nSen. Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, agreed that some groups within the rebel forces include radical elements. Rep. Tom Cotton, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, felt more strongly, stating that arming the rebels is \"something that should have been done months ago.\"\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, suggested that the U.S. could be \"hugely helpful\" in bringing down the Assad government by providing intelligence and training, but not boots on the ground.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest stated that the president feels \"that the Israelis are justifiably concerned about the threat posed by Hezbollah obtaining these advanced weapon systems.\" The president, according to Earnest, has often expressed his view that Israel, as a sovereign government, has the right to take the actions necessary to protect its people.",
    " Title: Hundreds of Workers Arrested in Mississippi Immigration Raids at Food-Processing Plants\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal immigration officials, under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), conducted raids on seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi on Wednesday, resulting in the arrest of approximately 680 individuals believed to be working in the U.S. without authorization. The raids were carried out by more than 600 ICE agents, who surrounded the targeted plants to prevent workers, primarily Latino immigrants, from escaping.\n\nThe raids, according to an ICE statement, were conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). In addition to the arrests, agents seized company business records. The targeted plants are near Jackson and are owned by five companies, as reported by The Associated Press.\n\nOne of the plants is owned by Koch Foods Inc., a U.S. poultry processor with more than 13,000 employees and an estimated $3.2 billion in annual revenue, according to Fortune. Another plant, in Canton, Miss., is owned by Peco Foods Inc., the eighth-largest poultry producer in the U.S., according to the company's website. Neither company responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe arrested workers were transported to a local Mississippi National Guard hangar, where they were interviewed about their immigration status, including whether they already had deportation orders.\n\nJulia Sol\u00f3rzano, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, stated, \"Today's raids are part of the ongoing war against immigrant families and the communities in which they live.\" She also noted the timing of the raids, which occurred days after immigrants were targeted by a gunman in El Paso, Texas.\n\nThe size of the raid operation recalls a similar incident in 2008, when more than 400 unauthorized workers were arrested in a meatpacking facility in Iowa under the George W. Bush administration. No further details about the current status of the arrested individuals or the future plans of the companies involved were available at the time of publication.",
    " Title: Partisanship and the U.S.-Israel Relationship: A Look at the Netanyahu-Obama Rift\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to the U.S. Congress has highlighted the role of partisanship in upending the status quo, particularly in relation to the U.S.'s relationship with Iran.\n\nThe White House has found itself navigating the partisan divide, with Netanyahu's controversial visit to Congress potentially dismantling a bipartisan consensus that once posed a significant domestic threat to the U.S.'s rapport with Iran. This potential deal, which could be a crowning achievement of President Obama's foreign policy legacy, has been a contentious issue due to opposition from both Republicans and staunch pro-Israel members of the Democratic party.\n\nNetanyahu's decision to accept an invitation from House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) without notifying the White House or the State Department has been criticized, with even Fox News anchors questioning his treatment of the president. His refusal to meet with Democratic Senators Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) further exacerbated the perceived partisanship.\n\nThe repercussions of this partisan stance have been significant. As reported by The New York Times, a former Israeli official lamented, \"Since when does an Israeli prime minister say no to a meeting with Democrats?\"\n\nThe Obama administration's response has been firm. The White House has snubbed Netanyahu, with both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden choosing not to meet with him. The administration has also not confirmed whether anyone will attend the annual summit of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a powerful pro-Israel lobby. [Update: Rice and Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., will attend.]\n\nIn a highly public manner, the White House has taken the fight to Netanyahu. National Security Advisor Susan Rice described Netanyahu's speech as \"destructive\" to U.S.-Israeli relations, a strong term that goes beyond diplomatic language. Secretary of State John Kerry used his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to remind everyone that Netanyahu supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nThis partisan rift has significant implications for those who believe a U.S. accord with Iran would spell doom for Israel. However, for those who advocate for diplomacy and negotiations, they might find partisanship to be a useful tool in this instance. As Dov Zakheim writes at Foreign Policy, \"Netanyahu's determination to address Congress has all but destroyed any chance the Hill's passing new sanctions and overriding a presidential veto. The deal will therefore go ahead.\"",

In response to questions about the appropriateness of Mr. Trump's Twitter posts given the biography and record of Representative John Lewis, Vice President-elect Mike Pence stated that the president-elect \"has the right to defend himself\" and that Mr. Trump aimed to call attention to Democratic policy failures in America's cities.\n\nA spokesman for the Trump transition team declined to provide further comment.\n\nAmong those who have announced they will not attend the inauguration are Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the dean of the House of Representatives, and Representative Barbara Lee of California. Conyers stated that he would work to ensure accountability within the administration and adherence to the Constitution and national laws. Lee expressed concern over Mr. Trump's treatment of the African-American community and the potential reflection of such views in his policies.\n\nOther members of Congress who have announced their absence from the inauguration include Representatives Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva of Arizona, Maxine Waters of California, Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois, Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts, William Lacy Clay of Missouri, Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, Jerrold Nadler, and Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of New York, Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio, Earl Blumenauer and Kurt Schrader of Oregon, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin.\n\nMr. Trump received scant support from the black community before his transition, with only about 8 percent of blacks voting for him on Nov. 8. The relationship between the president-elect and the black community appears to have further deteriorated with the appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, as White House chief strategist, with some fearing that Bannon will bring nationalist and racist views to the West Wing.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton led a march in Washington on Saturday, with Mr. Trump's Twitter posts reportedly driving more people to brave the cold to demonstrate.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Child Care Affordability Plan in Philadelphia Suburbs, Attacks Clinton on \"Deplorables\" Remark\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a visit to the Philadelphia suburbs on Tuesday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump unveiled his \"Child Care Affordability Plan.\" The plan, aimed primarily at suburban women voters, includes tax deductions for child care expenses, six weeks of paid maternity leave, and the creation of \"Dependent Care Savings Accounts\" to finance various expenses, including childhood development and elderly care.\n\nTrump addressed a supportive crowd in Aston, Pennsylvania, stating, \"It's pro-family, it's pro-child, it's pro-worker. These are the people we have to take care of.\" Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, who has been advocating for child care issues in her role as campaign adviser, introduced her father, telling the crowd that \"we need to create policies that champion all parents.\"\n\nTrump also criticized Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her \"basket of deplorables\" remark, slamming her in both Pennsylvania and at an earlier rally in Iowa. Clinton's campaign responded with a television ad juxtaposing Trump's comments about voters with his own past attacks on voters, including a comment from last year about then-GOP primary rival Ben Carson: \"How stupid are the people of Iowa? How stupid are the people of this country to believe this crap?\"\n\nMaya Harris, a senior policy adviser for the Clinton campaign, described Trump's child care plan as \"half-baked,\" with financing to come from other programs like unemployment insurance. Harris added, \"The lack of seriousness of this proposal is no surprise, given his history of disrespecting women in the workplace and the fact there\u2019s no evidence he ever provided paid family leave or child care to his own employees.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign has released new radio ads highlighting her \"lifelong commitment to fighting for children and families.\" Among her proposals is a plan to make preschool universal for 4-year-olds. The Trump campaign views Pennsylvania as a key part of its effort to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, though the state has not backed a GOP presidential candidate since 1988.\n\nCurrent polls give Democratic nominee Clinton an edge in Pennsylvania, with an average of around 6 points, according to the website RealClearPolitics. Some of those same surveys show low marks for Trump among suburban women, one of the targets of Trump's speech in Aston.\n\nThe specifics of Trump's child care proposals, according to the campaign statement, include:\n\n* Trump's proposed tax deductions for child care expenses are capped, with individuals making more than $250,000 and joint filers making more than $500,000 not eligible.\n* Lower income taxpayers would be eligible for rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n* Trump's proposed Dependent Care Savings Accounts could be financed by tax-deductible contributions and tax-free appreciation, and parents could use them to finance traditional child care, after-school programs, and tuition for private schools, as well as elder care for aged parents.\n\nThe campaign did not provide cost estimates, but indicated that they would be financed through elimination of waste and fraud in current programs.",

The lawsuit was filed by Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden at the St. Louis County Courthouse on Thursday morning.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Wilson \"unjustifiably shot and killed\" Brown, using \"an unnecessary and unreasonable\" amount of force. The lawsuit, which can be read at the St. Louis Public Radio site, also claims that Jackson was responsible for hiring, training, and supervising Wilson.\n\nFollowing the lawsuit's filing, family attorney Benjamin Crump stated that the Ferguson Police Department's internal culture made events like Brown's death predictable. \"To this day, we still do not believe that the shooter of an unarmed 18-year-old teenager has never been cross-examined,\" Brown said after the lawsuit was filed.\n\nCrump added that the family has been seeking a \"thorough independent review\" in which Wilson could potentially be challenged. Crump also noted that the family will not be seeking a specific amount in monetary damages.\n\nThe legal team expects the civil suit to rely on much of the same evidence presented in state and federal investigations into the police shooting. However, attorney Anthony Gray stated that the lawsuit will provide a \"more accurate picture of what took place that day.\"\n\nThe investigations into Brown's death did not result in indictments for Wilson. However, a Department of Justice report on the city's police department found \"a pattern of unconstitutional policing.\"",
    " Title: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Faces Decision on Confirmation Process for Trump Nominees\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is facing pressure from both sides as he navigates the confirmation process for President Trump's nominees. On one hand, he is confronted with a restless Democratic caucus and a group of activists, allegedly funded by George Soros, demanding he block eight Trump nominees. These groups, self-proclaimed as a \"Resistance,\" are pushing for a \"scorched earth\" approach, aiming to obstruct good appointees. On the other hand, moderate voices within the Democratic caucus urge Schumer to calm the passions and act responsibly.\n\nThe Democratic Party's response to President Trump's election has reached a critical point, with delayed concession, recount attempts, and accusations of Russian interference. Now, the Senate Democrats, including seven up for reelection from Trump-win states, are opposing presidential appointments without pretense of regular order or apology. This has led to a media firestorm, with major news outlets reporting attacks on nominees by Democrat-funded groups, while Democratic Senators offer outraged sound bites.\n\nThe Democratic Party finds itself at a crossroads, with the potential for significant consequences. Under President Obama, Democrats have lost 1,042 governing seats in Congress, state legislatures, governorships, and the presidency. If the party continues its lurch to the left, it may risk alienating the American electorate and facing further losses.\n\nSenator Schumer's actions could determine the future of the Democratic Party. If he succumbs to the demands of the Radical Left, the Democratic Party may face a decline in public respect and support. Conversely, if Schumer restores propriety to the role of Minority Leader, the \"scorched earth\" approach will wane.\n\nAmericans do not subscribe to extremism or radical responses to electoral loss. If the Democratic Party continues to engage in anti-democratic behavior, it risks losing the respect of the American people and any hope of restoring a centrist identity.\n\nSchumer's decision will have far-reaching implications for the 2018 and 2020 elections. If he chooses to obstruct the confirmation process, President Trump may label the Senate Democrats' actions as off-balance, out-of-touch with America, and his party hijacked. This could lead to increased Democratic defections and a further decline in the party's standing.\n\nOn the other hand, if Schumer ensures a swift and orderly confirmation process for Trump's nominees, he may help restore the Democratic Party's reputation and avoid the potential decline into Whig status. The choice Schumer makes may determine the Democratic Party's fate for years to come.\n\nIn the words of Robert Frost, \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\" Schumer's decision could have lasting consequences for the Democratic Party and the confirmation process as a whole. Americans are watching, and they want a respectful, fair, and orderly process. Anything else smacks of extremism.",
    " Title: South Koreans Carry on with Life as Normal Amid North Korean Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the bustling metropolis of Seoul, South Korea, there is no discernible fear or anxiety among the populace despite the ongoing threats from North Korea. The city, which is just 30 miles from the demilitarized zone separating the two countries, is a scant minutes' target if a full-scale war were to break out.\n\nNorth Korea possesses an array of artillery and other conventional weapons that make its military a credible threat, especially to South Korea. Pyongyang is also believed to have thousands of tons of chemical agents, although it has denied possessing such weapons.\n\nDespite these threats, South Koreans seem to have grown accustomed to the constant warnings and threats from the North. \"We know North Korea doesn't want war,\" said one South Korean resident. \"They want money and food.\" The resident added that North Korea has tried various tactics, such as missile launches, the nuclear threat, and its million-man army, to blackmail the South.\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who visited Seoul this week, told a gathering at the Asian Leadership Conference that North Korea understands that an attack on South Korea, much less the United States, would mean \"regime-ending\" retaliation. He encouraged the South Koreans to focus on jobs, human dignity, the environment, and poverty reduction.\n\nSouth Koreans seem overwhelmingly willing to take this advice. In the week the author spent in Seoul, they found only one woman who remembered participating in civilian air raid drills 30 years ago. Today, Seoul's 25 million people have no ambition to live in constant fear.\n\nHowever, the threat of armed provocation is very real in a select few flashpoint areas. The prospect of war is unthinkable in Seoul, but in these areas, the threat is indeed real.\n\nThe author stood on a street corner near CNN's Seoul offices and looked up at the jagged peaks behind the Blue House, the South Korean presidential office. If missiles ever did come streaking toward the South Korean capital, they would likely arc above those mountains. The nearest shelter would be the subway system. The author considered how long it would take to reach the subway, even if they were lucky enough to see the missiles still short of their targets. The calculations were not at all comforting.\n\nLike everyone around them, the author decided to think about something else.",
    " Title: Kathy Griffin Apologizes for Controversial Trump Decapitation Artwork\n\nArticle:\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin has issued an apology for a performance art project that involved her holding a model of a decapitated head designed to resemble President Donald Trump. The controversial artwork, which drew widespread criticism and backlash, may have inadvertently brought about a rare moment of national unity since Trump's unexpected election.\n\nGriffin's stunt was reportedly inspired by a scene from a 2011 episode of Game of Thrones, which featured the severed head of former President George W. Bush. Producers later apologized for the scene and edited it out of later screenings.\n\nIn the aftermath, Griffin initially defended her actions, tweeting, \"Obviously, I do not condone any violence... I'm merely mocking the mocker in chief.\" However, she later deleted these tweets and removed the image from her social media accounts.\n\nThe photo, which marked a new low for Griffin, known for her provocative humor, was particularly shocking due to Griffin's admission of wrongdoing. Until now, her critics might have assumed she was unaware of crossing a line, but she seemed genuinely remorseful when she tweeted, \"I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong.\"\n\nGriffin acknowledged that the image was \"too disturbing\" and \"not funny,\" and that she understood \"how it offends people.\"\n\nThe backlash on social media was swift and widespread, with famous and not-so-famous individuals across the political spectrum condemning Griffin's actions. CNN, where Griffin co-hosts New Year's Eve, terminated its contract with her. CNN's Anderson Cooper tweeted, \"For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.\"\n\nPresident Trump also responded, tweeting, \"Griffin should be ashamed of herself... My children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!\"\n\nFormer First Daughter Chelsea Clinton shared similar sentiments, tweeting, \"This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president.\" Actress Debra Messing, a Hillary Clinton supporter, said, \"It wasn't right when people (sic) hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isn't right now.\"\n\nEven the Secret Service reacted, stating, \"Threats made against @SecretService protectees receive the highest priority of all our investigations.\"\n\nKathy Griffin crossed a line, even for Trump critics, and her actions sparked a significant backlash on social media.

The country's interim parliament, dominated by Islamist politicians, and their rivals are emerging as two distinct camps. Haftar's forces have attacked Islamist militias in Benghazi and claimed credit for an attack on the General National Congress (GNC), the parliament's official name.\n\nIn an attempt to diffuse the crisis, acting prime minister Abdullah Al-Thinni called on the GNC to vote immediately on a 2014 budget and to confirm his successor, the prime minister-elect, before a recess and elections for a new interim legislature. If confirmed, the new premier would be Libya's fifth since the fall of the Qaddafi dictatorship in 2011. However, past changes of leadership have failed to stop interference by powerful militias, and the GNC has been regularly deadlocked since its election in 2012.\n\nTripoli remains calm but tense as residents await the legislators' response to Mr. Thinni's proposal. Foreign embassies are on alert amid fears of widening conflict. The crisis reflects a rift between Islamist politicians who dominate the GNC and their non-Islamist rivals, but it is also drawing in armed groups who seem to be predominantly motivated by regional ties and opportunism.\n\nLast Friday, forces under Mr. Haftar attacked Islamist militias in Benghazi that he said authorities had failed to rein in. On Sunday, militiamen apparently aligned with Haftar attacked the GNC building in Tripoli. Haftar is demanding that the parliament cede its role to a constitutional drafting committee elected in February; he insists that he does not aspire to lead Libya.\n\nIn Benghazi, Haftar has won a degree of support from residents who hope he can put an end to a pattern of bombings, shootings, and abductions often blamed on hardline Islamist militias. Powerful militias from the city of Zintan, who reportedly took part in Sunday's attack on the GNC, seem to support Haftar, and yesterday, the Benghazi-based special forces unit of Libya's fledgling army pledged support as well, according to Reuters reports. Ibrahim Jadhran, a militia leader in eastern Libya who has seized oil ports to use as leverage to obtain greater regional autonomy, has also reportedly joined Haftar's camp, according to the Libya Herald.\n\nThe GNC's speaker has summoned other militias, notably from the city of Misrata, to Tripoli to resist what he describes as an anti-democratic power-grab by Haftar's camp, according to the Associated Press. It is unclear whether Misrata militias, which have a history of rivalry with their Zintan counterparts, have entered the city.\n\nIf the GNC heeds Thinni's appeal to vote without delay on the budget and prime minister from a secret location, as an unnamed legislator said it was, according to AP, it could ease tensions over the interim parliament and help prevent further fighting. The former cabinet member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described the proposal as \"very reasonable,\" but cautioned that Libya will need diplomatic guidance from allies such as the US and the European Union to resolve the crisis.\n\nFailure to reach a compromise could push Libya into further bloodshed that might draw in more of the country's armed groups. However, ordinary Libyans have no stomach for fighting, the former cabinet member says. While some residents of Benghazi see in Haftar a possible source of stability, others there remain skeptical of his apparent lack of a long-term agenda for the city and unclear ambitions. \"Is he qualified to run a city?\" the former cabinet member asks. \"Does he believe in elections? Would he act with vengeance?\"",
    " Title: U.S. and China Announce Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Ahead of Global Climate Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two largest carbon dioxide emitters, unveiled ambitious targets on Wednesday to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to foster a global agreement on climate change next year.\n\nPresident Obama announced that the U.S. would cut its emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, a deeper reduction than previously planned and more than the 17% reduction previously targeted through 2020. Most of the action will be required after President Obama leaves office in 2017.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping did not commit to a specific reduction in emissions but said China, which is still building coal-burning plants, would set a target of capping its greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030.\n\nPresident Obama described the U.S. goals as \"ambitious,\" stating that the accelerated pace of cuts will improve public health and boost jobs. He praised China for agreeing to \"slow, peak and then reverse\" its carbon emissions eventually.\n\nChina is also pledging to get about 20% of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. It was unclear how feasible it would be for either country to meet their goals, and President Obama's pledge was sure to confront tough opposition from ascendant Republicans in Congress.\n\nIncoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has frequently denounced President Obama's \"war on coal\" and wants to cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency. In a statement after the deal was announced, Mr. McConnell said the new targets agreed to by President Obama are \"unrealistic.\"\n\n\"Our economy can't take the president's ideological War on Coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners,\" Mr. McConnell said. \"This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs.\"\n\nHe added, \"The president said his policies were on the ballot, and the American people spoke up against them. It's time for more listening, and less job-destroying red tape. Easing the burden already created by EPA regulations will continue to be a priority for me in the new Congress.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups praised the deal, saying it would create momentum for a global climate-change pact in Paris next year among nearly 200 nations. Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, said, \"It's a new day to have the leaders of the U.S. and China stand shoulder-to-shoulder and make significant commitments to curb their country's emissions. They have both clearly acknowledged the mounting threat of climate change and the urgency of action. It's heartening to see this level of cooperation.\"\n\nIt was the first time that China has agreed, at least in principle, to cap its greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama said his visit to China produced a \"remarkable scope\" of agreements with Beijing, including a pact to extend visa limits for Chinese citizens and an understanding to expand an information technology agreement on the export of electronic goods.",
    " Title: American Prisoners Freed by North Korea: A Diplomatic Milestone\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump welcomed three American prisoners freed by North Korea on Thursday morning, marking a significant diplomatic milestone between the longtime adversaries. The freed prisoners, Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim, and Kim Hak-song, were escorted back to the U.S. by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington, D.C., at 2:42 a.m. Thursday.\n\nShortly after their arrival, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump boarded the plane to meet the Americans before accompanying them to the tarmac. President Trump, addressing a crowd of journalists, stated, \"I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the three wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting.\"\n\nThe release, largely seen as a goodwill gesture by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, could pave the way for a new era of U.S.-North Korea relations after heightened tensions last year saw President Trump and Kim threaten each other with nuclear strikes. The U.S. had long demanded the Korean-American citizens' release, with two of the men taken captive last year, while Kim Dong-chul has been detained since 2015. No other Americans are believed to be imprisoned in North Korea.\n\nKim Dong-chul, Tony Kim, and Kim Hak-song were taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for medical examinations after their meeting with the president and Vice President Pence. President Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that they appeared to be \"in good health.\" However, U.S. officials are likely cautious after the last American to be released from North Korean custody, Otto Warmbier, died shortly upon his return to the U.S. Warmbier's family is suing North Korea, stating their son, who suffered from severe brain damage, was \"brutally tortured and murdered\" by the country.\n\nThe Americans' release came during Pompeo's second visit to North Korea this year. In his latest trip, The New York Times reported, Pompeo secured the Americans' freedom Wednesday after ensuring stronger ties with North Korea in exchange for the country's promise to desert its nuclear weapons program.\n\n\"For decades, we have been adversaries,\" Pompeo said during a lunch hosted by the North Koreans. \"Now we are hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world, and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve.\"\n\nAlongside the detainees, Trump told reporters from the tarmac of Andrews Air Force Base that his \"proudest achievement will be when we denuclearize that entire [Korean] peninsula.\" Vice President Pence stated in an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that the release of the prisoners signaled a willingness by the North to negotiate in a way that appears \"different\" from past efforts.\n\nThroughout much of his first year in office, Trump repeatedly exchanged threats and insults with North Korea, once warning in a speech to the United Nations that he would \"totally destroy\" the country if Pyongyang threatened the U.S. and its allies. Trump is expected to meet with Kim for the first time in Singapore, though the White House has yet to reveal further details, and officials cautioned that the president may not yet have given his final approval. The meeting could take place in late May or early June.",
    " Title: Treasury Secretary's Potential Adjustment of Withholding Tables in Tax Debate Remains Hypothetical\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing tax debate in Washington D.C., a new proposal has emerged, suggesting that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner could temporarily shield middle-class taxpayers from potential tax hikes if no agreement is reached to prevent the expiration of Bush-era tax rates in January. This proposal does not involve ignoring tax laws or collecting different amounts of tax than what is due.\n\nThe proposal suggests that Geithner could adjust the withholding tables used by employers to determine how much to deduct from workers' paychecks for their taxes. By leaving the withholding tables unchanged for lower-income workers, it could create the appearance that their taxes have not increased. However, this is a risky strategy, as it requires a precise prediction of the eventual tax rate and the exact time it will take effect.\n\nIt is essential to clarify that this proposal does not change the amount of tax owed. If the tax rate increases, individuals will still owe more money. The proposal's purpose is to adjust the withholding tables, not the tax rates themselves.\n\nIn terms of solving the ongoing tax debate, this plan does not offer a resolution. The proposal remains a hypothetical solution, and its implementation would depend on various factors, including the exact tax rate and the timing of its implementation.",
    " Title: Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 Crashes in French Alps, Killing All 150 On Board\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Airbus A320 aircraft operated by Germanwings, a low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa, has crashed in the French Alps, likely resulting in the deaths of all 150 people on board, French officials stated. The plane, Flight 4U 9525, was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf, Germany.\n\nAs night fell on the area, French authorities called off the search operations, with plans to resume Wednesday morning, according to France 24. Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann reported that the plane began descending after reaching its regular height and dropped for eight minutes. The plane's cruising altitude is 38,000 feet, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nWinkelmann said the plane lost contact with French radar and French air traffic control at 10:55 a.m. local time when it was at a height of about 6,000 feet. \"We cannot say at this point in time why our colleague decided to lower the plane as swiftly as he did,\" Winkelmann said. \"We do not have any information about why he brought the plane down so quickly to a lower height.\"\n\nAt a subsequent news conference in Barcelona's El Prat airport, Heike Birlenbach, a Lufthansa vice president, said, \"For the time being, we say it's an accident. There's nothing more that we can say right now. Everything else would be speculation.\" Eric Heraud, a spokesman for the French Civil Aviation Authority, said the plane did not send out a distress signal, according to The Associated Press. Earlier reports said it had. The AP quoted Heraud as saying a combination of loss of radio contact with control and the plane's descent \"prompted the control service to declare a distress.\" Winkelmann said Germanwings could not confirm a distress signal had been sent.\n\nFlight 4U 9525 left Barcelona at 10:01 a.m. The aircraft was scheduled to land in Duesseldorf at 11:39 a.m., according to Flightaware.com. Winkelmann said the aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991 and had been operating for Germanwings, a low-cost Lufthansa subsidiary, since 2004. Its last routine check was Monday, he said, in Duesseldorf. Its last major inspection was in the summer of 2013, he said. Winkelmann said the captain who flew the plane was an experienced pilot who had flown for Lufthansa and Germanwings for 10 years.\n\nThe nationalities of the passengers have not been released, pending notification of kin, Germanwings said. However, the Education Ministry in German North Rhine-Westphalia state said 16 high-schoolers and two teachers from a school in Haltern, Germany, were aboard the flight. \"This is the darkest day in the history of our town,\" Haltern Mayor Bodo Klimpel said.\n\nMourners began streaming into Barcelona's airport just hours after the morning flight took off\u2014but never landed. The Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings has set up a Spanish language hotline for family and friends of those who were on the plane. The Spanish government says roughly a third of the 150 people on board had Spanish surnames. \"The Spanish king and queen issued their condolences from France. They were in Paris on a state visit, but cut short their trip, and rushed home to Spain,\" the article reports.\n\nAt a news conference, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box was located at the site of the crash, and would be used to investigate what caused the plane to go down. The exact location of the crash is unclear, but the terrain where the plane went down is difficult to access, officials said, hampering search efforts. We do know the Airbus A320 crashed in a remote part of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence region. Eric Ciotti, head of the regional council in southeast France, said the crash site was Meolans-Revels, near the popular ski resort of Pra Loup. However, Airbus said the crash occurred in nearby Prads-Haute-Bleone.\n\nEarlier, French President Francois Hollande said, \"The conditions of the accident suggest there would be no survivors.\" On Twitter, he expressed his condolences to the victims' families. German Chancellor Angel Merkel was \"shaken\" at the news of the crash, her spokesman Steffen Seibert said. Spanish President Mariano Rajoy called the crash a \"tragedy.\"\n\nAlain Vidal, France's secretary of state for transportation, told Europe 1 that the plane crashed in an area that is inaccessible by road. He said helicopters flying overhead spotted the debris and some bodies. Local officials said rescue workers were airlifted to the site.\n\nThe A320 is one of the most popular planes in the world for short- and medium-haul flights. In a statement, Airbus said:\n\n\"The aircraft involved in the accident, registered under D-AIPX was MSN (Manufacturer Serial Number) 147 delivered to Lufthansa from the production line in 1991. The aircraft had accumulated approximately 58,300 flight hours in some 46,700 flights. It was powered by CFM 56-5A1 engines.\"\n\nLe Monde says Tuesday's crash is the deadliest in French territory since 1981, when 180 people died in the crash of an Inex-Adria Aviopromet plane at Mount San Pietro. In July 2000, an Air France Concorde flying between Paris and New York crashed during takeoff near Paris, killing 113 people.",
    " Title: Afghan Security Forces End Siege on Sikh Temple in Kabul, 25 Dead\n\nArticle:\n\nAfghan security forces have concluded an hours-long operation at a Sikh religious complex in Kabul, resulting in the death of 25 individuals, according to the Ministry of Interior. The attack, which occurred on Wednesday, was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS). The Taliban had earlier denied involvement in the siege that left at least eight others wounded.\n\nWitness Raju Singh Sonny told the AFP that a man dressed in a police uniform entered the temple in central Kabul, shot a guard, and began attacking worshippers in the main hall. Several other attackers also entered the building and moved from room to room, shooting people, according to Sonny.\n\nInterior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian later confirmed the operation's conclusion, stating that all attackers were killed. Security forces cordoned off the area, located in old Kabul, after gunmen stormed the complex, as per the government's statement.\n\nNarindra Singh Khalsa, a parliamentarian from the minority Sikh community, told the AP news agency he was near the Gurdwara - the Sikh place of worship - when the attack occurred and ran to the site. Those killed included a child whose body was brought to a Kabul hospital, according to emergency services and the hospital.\n\nIn photographs shared by the interior ministry, about a dozen children were seen being rushed out of the Gurdwara by Afghan special forces, many of them barefoot and crying. Khalsa later told Reuters News Agency that many people were still inside the building. \"The gunmen started their attack at a time when the Dharamsala was full of worshippers,\" he said, referring to a sanctuary area in the temple compound.\n\nThe SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors activities by armed groups, reported that ISIL had claimed responsibility for the attack on its Aamaq media arm. Earlier this month, an affiliate of ISIL attacked a gathering of minority Shia Muslims in Kabul, killing 32 people.\n\nThe attack comes a day after the US announced it would cut its aid to the Afghan government by $1bn over frustrations that political leaders could not reach an agreement and form a team to negotiate with the Taliban. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Kabul on Tuesday in an attempt to resolve a standoff between President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, who also proclaimed himself president following a contested election.\n\nThe US and the Taliban signed a deal last month that was intended to pave the way for talks between the Afghan leadership and the rebels, but with Kabul unable to agree on who is in government, the talks have stalled. Sikhs, who number fewer than 300 families, have faced widespread discrimination in the country and have also been targeted by armed groups.\n\nIn 2018, a suicide bombing targeting the Sikh community and claimed by ISIL killed more than a dozen people in the eastern city of Jalalabad. Under Taliban rule in the late 1990s, Sikhs were asked to identify themselves by wearing yellow armbands, but the rule was not enforced. In recent years, large numbers of Sikhs and Hindus have sought asylum in India, which has a Hindu majority and a large Sikh population.",
    " Title: DeVos Defends School Reopening, Threatens Federal Funding for Non-Compliant Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos reiterated her stance on Sunday that there is no danger in sending children back to school amid the coronavirus pandemic and maintained her threat to withhold federal funds from schools that do not resume in-person classes.\n\nDuring an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" DeVos stated, \"There's nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous.\" She cited lower incidences of COVID-19 in children compared to other age groups and successful reopenings in other countries, such as Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nHost Chris Wallace questioned the comparison, stating, \"Is it really fair, is it reasonable to compare the situation in countries that have 20 new cases in a day with a country that has 68,000 new cases in a day?\" DeVos responded, \"We're talking about schools and other countries' experiences with reopening schools. And it has been shown to be very successful.\"\n\nWallace countered, \"Schools happen in an environment. If there's 30 cases in a country, that's very different than a place where it's out of control and there are 70,000 new cases in a day.\"\n\nDeVos argued that places with high case numbers are the exception, stating, \"When hot spots do appear, they have to be 'dealt with differently.'\" Schools that do not reopen should not be eligible for federal assistance, she said.\n\nWallace questioned DeVos' authority to unilaterally cut off funding, stating that most of the funds are allocated for disadvantaged students or students with disabilities. DeVos responded, \"American investment in education is a promise to students and their families. If schools are not going to reopen and not fulfill that promise, they should not get the funds, and give it to the families to decide to go to a school that is going to meet that promise.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized guidelines on reopening schools issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stating they are \"very tough,\" \"expensive,\" and \"impractical.\" DeVos clarified that the guidelines are only recommendations and are meant to be \"helpful\" for educators determining how to reopen.\n\nDr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Wallace that children are at a lower risk of serious infections than adults but not zero. He also noted that the efficiency of children spreading the virus in school is unclear, with some countries experiencing relatively uncommon spread while others, such as Israel, have had large outbreaks in schools after reopening.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized DeVos' comments, stating they amounted to \"malfeasance and dereliction of duty.\" Pelosi said, \"We all want our children to go back to school. Teachers do. Parents do. And children do. But they must go back safely.\" She added, \"They ignore science, and they ignore governance in order to make this happen.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Orders National Guard Troops Withdrawal from Washington D.C. Amid Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of thousands of National Guard troops from Washington D.C. following a weekend of largely peaceful protests against police brutality in the city. The decision came after a week of unrest following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n\nMembers of the administration defended the president's authority to call active-duty military to stand by in case they were needed to quell the unrest. In a tweet on Sunday, Mr. Trump stated, \"I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control. They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed.\"\n\nThe use of National Guard and active-duty military troops to calm the unrest sparked criticism, including from within the president's ranks. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper broke with the commander-in-chief on the issue, stating that the protests did not meet the heightened level to call for military intervention.\n\nAbout 1,600 active-duty military troops were sent to the nation's capital last week after a church and other buildings near the White House were set ablaze, and monuments were tagged with graffiti. However, the troops were not deployed to confront citizens.\n\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered Utah National Guard members out of a hotel near downtown last week, citing a budget issue. She made it clear that she did not want military-style police patrolling the streets.\n\nAttorney General William Barr said he thought members of the administration were on the same page that troops should be used as a last resort. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf defended the administration's moves, stating that the unrest diminished after the increase in law enforcement presence.",
    " Title: Tensions in Kashmir: A Shared Responsibility for India and Pakistan\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing tensions in Kashmir have been attributed to the actions of both India and Pakistan, with calls for a permanent peaceful resolution. The article discusses the case of Adil Ahmad Dar, a Kashmiri man who became a suicide bomber, and the factors that led to his radicalization.\n\nDar's father recounted instances of police brutality and mass protests in Kashmir in 2016, during which Indian troops reportedly killed about 100 protesters and blinded several hundred. Dar himself was shot in his leg during these protests. The article suggests that the structural violence and political repression in Kashmir played a significant role in Dar's radicalization.\n\nThe article also discusses the role of the Pakistani terrorist group Jaish-e-Muhammad, which claimed responsibility for the attack. The group was banned in 2002 following an attempt to assassinate the country's military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, but has continued to operate due to the reluctance of Pakistani officials to aggressively pursue or punish militant leaders.\n\nIndia's use of air power inside Pakistan for the first time since 1971 is also mentioned, with the article suggesting that this represents a significant departure from existing norms of engagement between the two countries. The article notes that India's actions may make it difficult for the country to dial back its response in the future.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has counseled calm and returned the Indian pilot captured from an attack plane that Pakistan downed. However, the article questions whether Khan or his successors will be able to maintain such composure if India continues to encroach on Pakistani sovereignty to hunt down terrorists.\n\nIn a separate context, the article discusses the 2020 U.S. presidential race and the policy proposals of candidates Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg. The article notes that Warren has provided more detail on Medicare financing and overall policy detail than her competitors, but criticizes her approach for trying to force people to join Medicare rather than allowing them to opt in.\n\nFinally, the article discusses the ongoing impeachment investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump. The article suggests that there is enough circumstantial evidence to support impeachment, but questions whether it will be enough to convince Republicans and lead to Trump's removal.",
    " Title: Michelle Obama Named Most Admired Woman, Barack Obama Most Admired Man for 11th Consecutive Year\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a survey conducted by Gallup, former First Lady Michelle Obama has been named the Most Admired Woman in the world for the first time, marking a change in the top spot after 17 years of Hillary Clinton's dominance. Barack Obama, her husband and former President, has been named the Most Admired Man for the 11th consecutive year.\n\nThe survey, which has been conducted annually since 1946, asks Americans to name the man and woman they admire most, living anywhere in the world today. This year's survey was conducted from December 3-12.\n\nMichelle Obama, who is currently touring to promote her recently released autobiography, won by a significant margin this year. Oprah Winfrey placed second, with Clinton and Melania Trump following.\n\nIn the men's category, Barack Obama has been the winner for the 11th consecutive year, including one year as president-elect, eight as president, and two as former president. President Donald Trump ranked second for the fourth year in a row.\n\nQueen Elizabeth, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, human rights activist Malala Yousafzai, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi are among the top 10 most admired women this year.\n\nThe top 10 most admired men this year includes former President George W. Bush, Pope Francis, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former President Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe list is notable for the absence of two men who often ranked high but passed away in 2018, Sen. John McCain and the Rev. Billy Graham. McCain finished in the top 10 six times, while Graham had more top 10 finishes than any man or woman, a record 61 times.\n\nBarack Obama is now just one first-place finish short of tying Dwight Eisenhower for the most times being Most Admired Man. Eisenhower won the distinction 12 times. This year marks only the 13th time in 72 measurements that the incumbent president did not win. Usually, the president does not win when he has subpar job approval ratings, as is the case with Trump.\n\nThe full results of the survey, including the methodology, can be found on the Gallup website.",
    " Title: The Electoral College: A Historical Compromise and Its Controversial Modern Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Electoral College, a system established by the Founding Fathers to elect the President of the United States, has been a subject of debate since its inception. Alexander Hamilton described it as \"excellent, if the manner of it be not perfect.\" The Electoral College was a compromise between a popular vote and Congress selecting the President.\n\nIn the Electoral College system, each state is assigned a number of Electors equal to the sum of its Senators and Representatives in Congress. This results in a total of 538 Electors, with a 270 majority needed to elect the President. The Electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the popular vote in each state, with the exception of Nebraska and Maine, where votes are allocated proportionally.\n\nThe Electoral College was a compromise designed to address concerns about a \"democratic mob\" influencing the election and potential corruption if Congress directly elected the President. The system was also a compromise in that it leveraged the popular vote to determine a winner by state, but a body of Electors from each state would ultimately determine the winner.\n\nSince its establishment over 200 years ago, there have been over 700 proposals to eliminate or reform the Electoral College in Congress. The provisions for electing the President and Vice President have been among the most amended parts of the Constitution. The last serious attempt to change the Electoral College began in 1966, but the proposal was defeated, falling short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution.\n\nIn response to the ongoing debate, some states have signed a pact to bypass the Electoral College without amending the Constitution. This pact would award Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote, regardless of the outcome in individual states. For example, if a democratic candidate won the popular vote in California but a Republican won the national popular vote, all of California's Electoral votes would be awarded to the Republican candidate.\n\nThe Electoral College system's supporters argue that it encourages candidates to build coalitions and pay attention to the entire country instead of a few populous mega-cities. Opponents argue that the system discourages candidates from paying attention to the entire country and instead focuses on a few battleground states. The debate continues as to whether the Electoral College system accurately represents the will of the people and ensures fair elections.",
    " Title: House Republicans Divided Over Legal Status for Undocumented Immigrants, Focus on Border Security\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives have expressed disagreement over granting legal status to the estimated 11 million undocumented people residing in the United States, following a 2 1/2-hour closed-door meeting on Wednesday. The meeting was held to discuss immigration reform, with a focus on bolstering border security.\n\nAccording to several lawmakers, there appears to be no consensus over calls for granting legal status to the 11 million, many of whom have lived in the United States for years. Republican Representative Steve King suggested that his colleagues are split \"50/50\" on the issue.\n\nThe Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate will likely need to reach an agreement, as the Senate approved a comprehensive immigration bill last month that includes a pathway to citizenship. Backers of the Senate bill insist that a path to citizenship must be part of any final bill that they help send to President Barack Obama to sign into law.\n\nThe Republican lawmakers stated that there was consensus on the need to secure the U.S. border further against illegal crossings. They suggested that House Speaker John Boehner could seek passage of such a bill as a first step toward a larger agreement.\n\nThe Republican leaders issued a statement rejecting a Senate-passed bill that puts the 11 million on a 13-year path to citizenship. Senator Jeff Flake, who helped write the Senate bill and served 12 years in the House, expressed disappointment, stating, \"It's hard not to be discouraged right now.\"\n\nThe Senate bill removes the threat of deportation for most illegal residents, but features several hurdles to citizenship, including learning English, paying back taxes, and passing criminal background checks. It authorizes $46 billion for border security and to revamp the visa system to help high-tech firms, farmers, and other businesses hire foreign workers.\n\nObama and his fellow Democrats have been calling for prompt action by the House. Earlier on Wednesday, the president told a group of Hispanic lawmakers that he was willing to do whatever it takes to help enact a bill. Even former President George W. Bush, who rarely wades into policy debates, gave a boost to efforts in Congress.\n\nHouse Republicans, who hold a 234-201 majority over Democrats, gave no indication of fast action on a major bill. \"It is going to be a process of months, not days or weeks,\" Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma told Reuters in a telephone interview after Wednesday's meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is reportedly working on a plan to grant citizenship for children of illegal immigrants who are in the United States through no fault of their own, according to Republican lawmakers. In the past, Republicans have blocked such legislation.\n\nHowever, even that relatively modest step is controversial among some of the most conservative House Republicans. Representative Mo Brooks stated, \"Anyone who has come to our country, their first step on American soil is to thumb their nose at American laws... we should not award them with our highest honor, which is citizenship.\"\n\nEarlier, the White House signaled that Obama will become more publicly engaged in the intensifying immigration debate in Congress. The administration released a report arguing that passing sweeping immigration reforms such as the Senate's would expand the economy 3.3 percent by 2023 and reduce the federal deficit by almost $850 billion over 20 years.\n\nThomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which wants comprehensive immigration reforms enacted, expressed hope that public support would prompt House Republicans to eventually back a major bill. \"If the arguments are compelling, this deal is not over by any means,\" he said.\n\nThe November presidential election, in which Obama captured more than 70 percent of the growing Hispanic vote, was seen by many Republicans as a wake-up call that their party must do more to appeal to minorities. The call for comprehensive reform resonates with some Republican senators and with some prospective Republican presidential candidates.\n\nHowever, it holds less appeal to House Republicans who fear challenges from the conservative Tea Party movement if they back a pathway to citizenship, a core demand of Democrats. According to a recent study by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which tracks congressional races, only 24 of the 234 House Republicans represent districts that are more than 25 percent Hispanic.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary in Tight Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Chuck Hagel's nomination as Defense Secretary on Tuesday, concluding a contentious battle that revealed deep divisions among senators regarding President Barack Obama's Pentagon pick. The vote was historically close, with 58 senators in favor and 41 opposing.\n\nDespite Hagel's background as a former Republican senator, the resistance to his nomination demonstrated an unusual level of distrust among many senators towards the individual chosen to lead the Defense Department, as the country is currently winding down the Afghanistan war and assessing emerging threats from Iran, Syria, and other regions in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nRepublicans had initially delayed the nomination due to demands for more information from the Obama administration regarding the September 11 Libya attacks. Additionally, they raised concerns about Hagel's past statements and votes on various issues, including Israel, Iran, and nuclear weapons.\n\nSenator John McCain, a leading Republican, clashed with Hagel over his opposition to President George W. Bush's decision to send additional troops to Iraq in 2007, a time when the war seemed to be nearing a critical point. Hagel, who voted to authorize military force in Iraq, later opposed the conflict, comparing it to Vietnam and arguing that it diverted attention from Afghanistan.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid questioned the delaying tactics employed by his Republican colleagues, stating, \"Twelve days later, nothing. Nothing has changed.\" He defended Hagel, asserting, \"Sen. Hagel's exemplary record of service to his country remains untarnished.\"\n\nReid attributed the delay to partisanship over Obama's second-term national security team. Both Reid and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Democrat, emphasized the urgency to act, given the impending automatic, across-the-board budget cuts affecting the Pentagon.\n\nHagel will succeed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and join Obama's retooled national security team. The Senate's split decision saw Republicans turning on their former party colleague, while Democrats stood by Obama's nominee.\n\nHagel also faced criticism over a May 2012 study he co-authored for the advocacy group Global Zero, which called for an 80 percent reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons and the eventual elimination of all the world's nuclear arms. The group argued that with the end of the Cold War, the United States can reduce its total nuclear arsenal to 900 without compromising security. Currently, the U.S. and Russia have approximately 5,000 warheads each, either deployed or in reserve.\n\nIn an echo of the 2012 presidential campaign, Hagel faced criticism from well-funded, Republican-leaning outside groups that labeled him \"anti-Israel\" and pressured senators to oppose the nomination. The groups ran television and print ads criticizing Hagel.\n\nOpponents were particularly incensed by Hagel's use of the term \"Jewish lobby\" to refer to pro-Israel groups. He later apologized, stating he should have used another term and should not have suggested that these groups had intimidated members of the Senate into favoring actions contrary to U.S. interests.\n\nThroughout the confirmation process, Hagel spent weeks reaching out to members of the Senate, meeting individually with lawmakers to address their concerns and seeking to reassure them about his policies. Hagel's performance during his confirmation hearing was inconsistent, which some believe may have contributed to the close vote. However, it did not result in a significant erosion of Democratic support for the president's choice, and Hagel already had the backing of three Republicans prior to the final vote. Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., also switched to support Hagel in the final vote.",
    " Title: President Trump's Job Approval Ratings Surge to Highest Levels Since Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's job approval numbers have reached their highest levels since the beginning of his presidency, according to the RealClearPolitics poll of polls. As of the latest data, Trump's approval rating stands at 47 percent, surpassing his previous record of 46 percent by a full point. Simultaneously, his disapproval rating has dipped to 49.5 percent, marking the first time it has been below 50 percent since February 2017, the month after he assumed the presidency.\n\nIn the past ten days, Trump's approval rating has improved by a net 6.5 points, with his average approval rating being three points lower at 44 percent and his disapproval rating being 3.5 points higher at 53 percent just over a week ago.\n\nThe improvement in Trump's numbers is largely attributed to his handling of the medical and financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Recent polling shows either a plurality or an outright majority approve of the job he is doing in handling this crisis. A recent Gallup poll showed a 60 percent approval rating.\n\nTrump's early travel ban, implemented on January 31, is being viewed more favorably with each passing day. The European Union did not institute travel bans until about two weeks ago, and the current situation in Europe is a point of comparison. Trump's travel bans are estimated to have prevented around half a million travelers from epidemic areas from entering the country.\n\nTrump's daily press briefings have allowed him to communicate directly with the American people, with millions tuning in. These briefings have been moved to prime time, which has increased viewership. The media have begun to blacklist these briefings, with some far-left outlets, such as CNN and NBC News, already taking this action.\n\nTrump's leadership in slashing red tape, cutting regulations, and involving the private sector has been noted. His daily briefings feature impressive experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. The media are attempting to pit these experts against Trump, but the public appears to appreciate a president willing to have a public debate about the appropriate response to the medical and economic crises.\n\nTrump is working well with Democrats, such as Governors Newsom of California and Cuomo of New York, which is crucial given that these two states are major hot spots. He also worked with Democrats in the U.S. Senate to pass the $2 trillion stimulus package. The public is seeking cooperation between political parties during this time, and Trump's ability to work with Democrats is being viewed positively.\n\nThe media are being criticized for their handling of the situation, and Trump is being praised for his ability to handle their actions with skill. This skill is giving the public confidence in Trump's competence, as he is not perceived as being caught off guard or lacking answers during the crisis.\n\nA recent poll shows that the public approves of everyone's handling of the coronavirus situation, except the media. The media are being criticized for their questions, with some finding them to be inappropriate, such as asking how many deaths are acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, the president's job approval ratings have reached their highest levels since the beginning of his presidency, and the public appears to approve of his handling of the coronavirus crisis. The media are being criticized for their handling of the situation, and Trump is being praised for his ability to handle their actions with skill.",
    " Title: Trump's 2020 Budget Proposal Faces Criticism for Relying on \"Accounting Gimmicks\" and Overly Optimistic Economic Growth Projections\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's proposed budget for 2020 aims to address the growing national debt, which surpassed $22 trillion recently. In a message to Congress, Trump stated that the budget plan provides a clear roadmap for controlling federal spending and debt. However, the 150-page budget proposal has been met with criticism for relying on \"accounting gimmicks\" and overly optimistic economic growth projections.\n\nThe budget proposal, released on Monday, would run trillion-dollar deficits in each of the next four years and take 15 years to balance, even with optimistic assumptions about future economic growth. This is five years longer than the Trump administration's first budget promised. The budget also fails to deliver on Trump's campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years.\n\nUnder the projections included in the budget plan, the country would run a deficit of $631 billion in 2025, hardly smaller than the $666 billion deficit in the final fiscal year of President Barack Obama's time in office. Over 10 years, Trump's budget would add more than $7.9 trillion to the national debt.\n\nThe real outcome is likely to be much worse than the estimates provided by the White House. The budget assumes 3 percent annual economic growth for the next decade, a figure that's well in excess of what most economists expect. The Federal Reserve, for example, projects 2.3 percent growth over the next year.\n\nWithout those overly rosy assumptions, the national debt would likely be $2 trillion higher by 2029, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonpartisan group that advocates for balanced budgets. The group says the budget is likely to add about $10 trillion to the national debt by 2029.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the CRFB, stated, \"President Trump's budget aims to reverse an unsustainable fiscal situation and put debt on a downward path relative to the economy. Unfortunately, as in previous years, he relies on far too many accounting gimmicks and fantasy assumptions and puts forward far too few actual solutions.\"\n\nThe latest projections from the Congressional Budget Office assume lower levels of future revenue than the Trump budget does. As a result, the CBO does not expect the deficit to decline during the next decade, and expects that it will reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2029.\n\nWhile the budget proposal includes $660 billion in savings from repealing and replacing Obamacare, this policy seems virtually impossible now that Democrats hold the House. Already, Democrats are slamming Trump's budget for the non-defense discretionary cuts the administration has proposed.\n\nThe budget also faces criticism for attempting to hide spending increases for the Pentagon by moving those new funds into off-the-books accounts originally meant to pay for America's foreign wars. The administration says it wants to tackle wasteful spending in welfare and other domestic programs, but there's plenty of wasteful spending at the Pentagon, too.\n\nBalancing a budget that's $22 trillion in the red is not easy, but the first requirement should be to stop making matters worse. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, wrote, \"Federal debt is soaring even after a decade of economic growth. Debt is imposing a rising cost that burdens all of us. Politicians have always had incentives to spend, but never before has Washington been so irresponsible.\"\n\nTrump's budget also calls for the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, which are currently expected to expire in 2025. As Edwards points out, the budget could balance within 10 years\u2014even with lower expected revenues\u2014if annual spending growth was restrained to 1.8 percent. That's a reasonable figure. Unfortunately, this budget ignores it.",
    " Title: State Legislatures Take Center Stage in Political Battles as Gridlock Persists in Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nAnalysts suggest that issues addressed by state legislatures this year, which include gun control, health care, education, and police procedures, may have more immediate and lasting effects than anything approved in Washington, D.C., where the government is divided. The roots of the polarization in state legislatures can be traced back to elections in 2010, when Republicans made significant gains in statehouses and pushed for policies such as restricting labor unions and abortion access, while expanding gun rights, according to Sarah F. Anzia, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt around the same time, national organizations representing various interest groups, including teachers and gun owners, became more active in state capitals because they found it easier to make headway in places like Sacramento and Charleston, W.Va., than in Washington due to gridlock in Congress.\n\nThe number of states with either supermajorities of Democrats that also have Democratic governors (California, Nevada, and Oregon, among others) or Republicans with Republican governors (Alabama, Ohio, and Tennessee, among others) has grown. This means that many lawmakers rarely feel the need to compromise.\n\n\"If you are a Republican in one state, you are probably going to be pushing the same agenda as a Republican in another state, and the same is true for Democrats,\" said Dr. Anzia. \"That hasn't always been true, and the result is that now more than ever, state legislatures are key players in these partisan battles over politics.\"\n\nIn Minnesota, the only state left with a divided legislature, promises of bipartisanship sometimes devolved into stalemate. During a budget standoff last month, Tim Walz, the Democratic governor who campaigned last year on a pledge to work across the aisle, angrily denounced Republicans for blocking gun control efforts and supporting deep tax cuts, saying those policies \"fit better in Mississippi and Alabama than they do in Minnesota.\"",
    " Title: Trump Terminates Navy Secretary Richard Spencer Over Gallagher Case and Contracting Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Donald Trump announced the termination of Richard Spencer, the Secretary of the Navy, by Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Trump criticized Spencer for his handling of the trial of Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher and other performance issues.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter, \"I was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's trial was handled by the Navy. He was treated very badly but, despite this, was completely exonerated on all major charges. I then restored Eddie's rank. Likewise, large cost overruns from past administration's contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction. Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer's services have been terminated by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.\"\n\nTrump did not specify the contracting issues he referred to, but he and Spencer have had disagreements over the delivery schedule of the Navy's next aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford. Delays have plagued the carrier's weapons elevators, and Spencer publicly bet Trump last January that if the problems weren't resolved by the next time the warship put out to sea, the president could fire him\u2014only for the carrier to conduct sea trials last month with only some of its elevators working.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and his administration's top Pentagon leaders has been marked by increasing turmoil over the past year, starting with retired Gen. Jim Mattis' resignation as Defense secretary in December after a presidential order, which was later partly reversed, to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. Trump has since gone through three acting Defense secretaries\u2014including, briefly, Spencer\u2014before Esper was confirmed in July. On Esper's watch, Trump has again ordered a pullout from Syria, only to again partially reverse it under pressure from the Pentagon and Congress.\n\nSen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, \"Both Secretary Esper and President Trump deserve to have a leadership team who has their trust and confidence. It is no secret that I had my own disagreements with Secretary Spencer over the management of specific Navy programs, and I look forward to receiving and considering a nomination for the next Secretary of the Navy as soon as possible.\"\n\nGallagher was acquitted over the summer of murdering a wounded prisoner in Iraq but convicted of posing for a photo with the militant's body and was demoted. Days after Trump restored Gallagher's rank earlier this month, Navy officials said the top admiral responsible for the SEALs was notifying Gallagher and three of his superior officers that boards were being convened to consider expelling them from the commando unit.\n\n\"I hereby acknowledge my termination as United States Secretary of the Navy, to be effective immediately,\" Spencer wrote in a letter to Trump, which was posted on Twitter by CNN. Spencer did not refer in the letter to the communications with the White House that the Pentagon cited in its announcement.\n\nOutgoing Secretary of the Navy Spencer's acknowledgment-of-termination letter states, \"I can not in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag, and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" This appears to be a reference to Trump's direction that the Navy not eject Gallagher from the SEALs.\n\nAfter Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley spoke with Trump about Gallagher's case on Friday, Hoffman said, \"Secretary Esper learned that Secretary Spencer had previously and privately proposed to the White House\u2014contrary to Spencer's public position\u2014to restore Gallagher's rank and allow him to retire with his Trident pin.\" Despite asking for Spencer's resignation over the proposal, though, Esper \"has directed that Gallagher retain his Trident pin,\" the insignia that marks him as a SEAL, Hoffman said.\n\n\"Eddie Gallagher's and his family's fervent hope is that this truly is the end of the road, and he can go into retirement\" as a SEAL, said Timothy Parlatore, Gallagher's lawyer.\n\nWhatever the apparent mismatch between the Pentagon statement and Spencer's letter, Trump's unusual intervention in the Gallagher case is at the root of the clash that led to Spencer's departure. Former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said, \"This all started with the president. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for his actions, and I don't think you can lose sight of that.\" Mabus, who held the top Navy post in the Obama administration, added, \"He undermined good order and discipline. He dishonored the SEALs by saying they couldn't hold a review board. So that's what got us into this mess. This is just one more example showing that if you deal with this president, it's not going to end well.\"\n\nA former senior Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a situation in which the facts are unclear, agreed, \"This is typical Trump. This is the Trump circus. Everything he touches turns into this convoluted process of politics that we're seeing today over at the Pentagon.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Questions Michael Cohen Over Secretly Recorded Conversation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has questioned his former attorney, Michael Cohen, regarding a conversation they had that was secretly recorded by Cohen. The conversation, which was aired by CNN on Tuesday, pertained to a payment to a former Playboy model who alleged an affair with Trump.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, Trump expressed his disapproval of Cohen's actions, asking, \"What kind of a lawyer would tape a client?\" The president did not directly name Cohen or criticize him harshly but instead posed a series of questions about the recording.\n\nIn the recording, Cohen can be heard discussing the establishment of a company for the transfer of information related to American Media Inc. head David Pecker. The conversation suggests a payment, with Trump saying, \"pay with cash,\" although the sound quality is unclear as to whether Trump is suggesting paying or not.\n\nThe recording is legal under New York law, as it only requires one party to consent to allow a conversation to be recorded. However, experts have stated that the tape does not prove any criminal wrongdoing. The tape is one of 12 that the government seized during a raid of Cohen's apartment, office, and hotel room earlier this year. The contents of the other tapes are not publicly known at this time.\n\nTrump had previously criticized the FBI after the bureau raided Cohen's office in April, calling it an \"attack on our country.\" However, he has largely refrained from explicitly tweeting about or commenting on Cohen as the case progresses in the Southern District of New York.\n\nCohen, who worked for years as the president's fixer at the Trump Organization, is reportedly under investigation for bank fraud and campaign finance law violations. He has recently raised speculation that he might cooperate with investigators after stating his \"first loyalty\" is to the country, not Trump.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Visits State Beach During Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie faced criticism over the weekend after photos emerged of him enjoying a day at Island Beach State Park, a state-operated beach that was closed to the public due to a government shutdown. The New Jersey Star-Ledger published aerial photos of Christie and his family on the beach, with the governor lounging in a beach chair and his family participating in activities such as paddleboarding and enjoying beverages.\n\nAt a press conference in Trenton on Sunday, Christie was asked if he had gotten any sun that day. \"I did not,\" he reportedly said. \"I did not get any sun today.\" When told there were photos of the governor on the beach, his spokesman said that the governor was briefly on the beach talking to his family. \"He did not get any sun,\" the spokesman added. \"He had a baseball hat on.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Christie had defended using the state park that was closed to the rest of the state's residents due to the budget impasse. He told the newspaper that his family does not use any state services while at the park, and emphasized that his residence is separate from the park.\n\nTwitter users reacted to the news with a variety of memes and comments. One of the most pointed headlines to come out of the beach controversy was from the Asbury Park Press, which wrote, \"Gov. Christie, get the hell off the beach!\"\n\nChristie's second term as governor ends in January 2018, when presumably he will have ample time to enjoy the beach. On Monday morning, the governor tweeted a photo of a beach, touting many open beaches in New Jersey. Municipal parks and beaches are open (and were reportedly packed over the weekend), but state beaches remain closed due to the shutdown.\n\nChristie called in to a local Fox News affiliate on Monday to say that if the Legislature passes a budget, he will sign it. Fox anchor Teresa Priolo asked Christie if his beach visit signaled that he was out of touch with the people of his state.\n\n\"Most of the time when they catch politicians with hidden cameras and planes flying over you, they catch you with someone you're not supposed to be with,\" Christie said. \"I was actually with who I was supposed to be with and where I was supposed to be. And I really wonder about journalists who spend money flying planes to look whether people are actually where they said they would be. I'm sure there are Pulitzers coming, it will be great.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Christie's own Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno posted her disapproval of Christie's beach visit on Facebook. Guadagno, a Republican, has been Christie's second-in-command since 2010 and is now running for governor herself. In a Quinnipiac poll, the Democratic candidate, Phil Murphy, leads Guadagno 55-26 percent.",
    " Title: House Republican Leaders Call for Hearing on State Department's Refusal of Security Requests in Benghazi Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo House Republican leaders, Representatives Darrell E. Issa and Jason Chaffetz, announced on Tuesday that they would hold a hearing on October 10 to investigate the September 11 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The lawmakers cited 13 security-related incidents in Benghazi in the six months prior to the attack, including a Facebook page that threatened Ambassador Stevens.\n\nIn a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the representatives stated that the U.S. mission in Libya had made repeated requests for increased security in Benghazi, but these requests were denied by officials in Washington. The State Department, however, has pledged its cooperation with the congressional investigation.\n\nThe Pentagon is reportedly preparing data to help identify and potentially capture militants suspected of conducting the Benghazi attack. Meanwhile, State Department officials have said that Mrs. Clinton will respond immediately to the lawmakers' requests and will cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\nSeveral former government officials have stated that no reasonable security presence could have successfully defended the consulate against the sophisticated, multi-stage assault by extremists armed with automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenade-launchers, and mortars. The attack occurred amid widespread protests directed against U.S. facilities throughout the Arab world, sparked by an Internet video denigrating Islam's Prophet Muhammad.\n\nFor more than a week, administration officials maintained that the attack was \"spontaneous,\" stating that it had developed out of an angry demonstration outside the consulate. However, the U.S. director of national intelligence now says that this information was the result of erroneous early analyses of the events and officials have linked it to terrorist groups.\n\nRepublicans have criticized the administration for taking eight days to use the term \"terrorist attack\" to describe the assault and have accused the administration of downplaying the seriousness of the attack due to its contradiction of President Obama's election-campaign narrative about the success of his campaign against al Qaeda. More hawkish conservatives have said the attack was provoked by \"weakness\" on the part of the administration in the Middle East.\n\nThe hearing on the Benghazi attack is likely to highlight the deep differences between the parties' views on the best stance to take in the face of popular fury at the United States as a result of the anti-Muhammad film. It may also see some Democrats attempting to point a finger at Republicans, as the attack followed two years of major cuts by Congress to State Department funding for embassy construction and diplomatic security.\n\nThe investigation will join at least four other probes into the attack, including a special panel convened by Mrs. Clinton to report on security prior to the attack, an inquiry by the State Department's acting Inspector General, a criminal investigation by the FBI, and a Libyan criminal investigation.",

This decision follows similar moves by the parent companies of Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben's, and Mrs. Butterworth's to overhaul their imaging in response to renewed calls for racial equality.\n\nIn a news release, B&G Foods stated, \"We understand there are concerns regarding the Chef image, and we are committed to evaluating our packaging and will proactively take steps to ensure that we and our brands do not inadvertently contribute to systemic racism.\" The company also emphasized its stance against prejudice and injustice of any kind.\n\nThe breakfast cereal, which consists of enriched farina, has been criticized for the use of a smiling Black chef on its packaging since the 1890s. The mascot on early boxes was known as Rastus, a racial caricature of a Black man, which is considered derogatory. The image was replaced in the 1920s and is believed to be a depiction of a Chicago chef named Frank L. White, who died in 1938.\n\nQuaker Oats was the first to announce on Wednesday that it would retire Aunt Jemima from packaging on its brand of syrup and pancake mixes, stating that the character is \"based on a racial stereotype.\" Hours later, Mars, the owner of Uncle Ben's brand, announced it \"is the right time to evolve the Uncle Ben\u2019s brand, including its visual brand identity.\"\n\nConagra Brands also announced on Wednesday that it has \"begun a complete brand and packaging review on Mrs. Butterworth's.\" The shape of the brand\u2019s syrup bottles is believed to be a racial caricature of the stereotype for Black women.\n\nThe review of Mrs. Butterworth's brand comes after the announcements made by Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben's. The changes in these brands follow a growing movement to remove racial stereotypes from consumer products.",
    " Title: Anne Holton Steps Up as Surrogate for Hillary Clinton Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nAnne Holton, the wife of Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine and daughter of a former Republican governor in the swing state of Virginia, is increasingly taking a more prominent role on the campaign trail for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Holton, who has a background in law and politics, is leveraging her unique position to push Clinton's education platform and potentially help shore up support among women voters who may be having second thoughts about Clinton.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, Clinton's popularity among registered voters hit a new low, with 41 percent of Americans having a positive view of Clinton and 56 percent having a negative view. Her popularity among women sank to 45-52 percent, a significant drop from a month prior.\n\nWhile former President Clinton can speak to his wife's accomplishments, it may be tougher for him to present Clinton as a relatable figure to women voters who may be on the fence. On the stump, Holton is comfortable highlighting Clinton's role as a new grandmother and focusing on the particulars of the candidate's education platform.\n\nHolton has been making appearances in key states, such as New Hampshire and Virginia, where she toured Virginia Western Community College and pushed Clinton proposals to make college tuition free for some students. She also made stops in Virginia to campaign and attend a volunteer appreciation event.\n\nHolton's father, A. Linwood Holton Jr., was a moderate Republican who in 1970 became the first GOP governor to be elected in Virginia in nearly a century. Holton's father worked to integrate the schools in response to court-ordered desegregation, even sending a young Anne Holton to attend a public school in Richmond with a black student majority.\n\nThe Clinton campaign declined an interview request from FoxNews.com. On the Republican side, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, hasn't been as visible as Holton but is starting to show up more on the trail. Two weeks ago, Karen Pence, who also has an accomplished background in education, accompanied her husband on a swing through Georgia.",

In his holiday message, Mr. Obama did not make any references to political battles.\n\nMr. Obama and his family will spend the holiday at the White House \"just like many of you\u2014sitting down with family and friends to eat some good food, tell stories, watch a little football, and most importantly, count our blessings.\"\n\nAmong those blessings, he said, are America's men and women in uniform.\n\n\"We give thanks for the freedoms they defend\u2014the freedom to think what we want and say what we think, to worship according to our own beliefs, to choose our leaders and, yes, criticize them without punishment,\" the president said. \"People around the world are fighting and even dying for their chance at these freedoms.

The new law, Act 746, took effect on August 16, but Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel has stated that the law does not remove restrictions on carrying weapons openly.\n\nThe new law defines a journey as traveling \"beyond the county in which the person lives,\" which Arkansas Carry argues clarifies the law and allows for open carry. However, the attorney general's opinion states that the law does not authorize so-called \"open carry.\"\n\nSteve Jones, the chairman of Arkansas Carry, said the group coordinated the event with police and prosecutors. Fort Smith Police Chief Kevin Lindsey wrote in an email to officers that there would not be a violation of the law unless \"an officer could prove that there was an unlawful attempt to employ a handgun, knife, or club as a weapon against a person.\"\n\nSgt. Daniel Grubbs, a spokesman for the department, said, \"The chief is not really getting into the debate of agreeing or disagreeing with the AG's opinion. It's 'you've given us a scenario, here's what you'd like to do, as long as everyone is lawfully in possession, they're legally able to possess one and they do not commit any type of crime, no one is going to be arrested.'\"\n\nA spokesman for McDaniel declined to comment on Saturday's event.

    " Title: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Faces Internal Challenges as Democrats Buck Leadership on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is facing increasing challenges in maintaining control over the Democratic party, as evidenced by recent events such as the impeachment motion and the resignation of former Representative John Conyers.\n\nOn Wednesday, a motion to impeach President Trump was introduced by House Democrats, despite Pelosi's months-long insistence on holding off on impeachment proceedings. Fifty-eight Democrats voted in favor of impeachment, despite Pelosi's objections. In a joint statement, Pelosi and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer stated, \"Now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.\"\n\nPelosi's hesitance to push for impeachment has put her at odds with left-wing activist groups who have been demanding Trump's impeachment since before he was sworn into office.\n\nThe resignation of John Conyers last Friday marked another instance where House Democrats have acted independently of Pelosi's authority. Sworn affidavits signed by four of his former staffers describe Conyers, who resigned on Friday, as a serial sexual harasser who preyed on his female staffers and demanded sexual favors from them. Conyers also allegedly abused taxpayer resources to pursue sexual relationships with women.\n\nInitially, Pelosi defended the 88-year-old Conyers as \"an icon\" and deferred to a House Ethics Committee investigation, a process that can stretch out for years. It took Pelosi 10 days to call for Conyers' resignation, which she did only after facing the prospect of a revolt from members furious over Conyers remaining in office.\n\nThe first two Democrats to demand Conyers' resignation were New York Rep. Kathleen Rice, who has called for Pelosi to step down from her leadership position, and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a first-term congresswoman. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for House Minority Leader last year, also pressured Democratic leadership, demanding last Wednesday that the investigation into Conyers finish up by the end of the week.\n\nOn the same day, Rice, a second-term congressman, stormed out of a meeting with House Democrats about Conyers because she didn't believe they were taking the matter seriously enough. New York Rep. Joseph Crowley and California Rep. Linda Sanchez, the chair and vice-chair of the House Democratic Caucus, took the opposite position, urging restraint and trying to draw the process out.\n\n\"I don't know all the facts, I don't know the specific allegations,\" Sanchez said, adding that she \"can't sit and judge a member and call for their resignation unless I've been party to hearing all of the evidence and hearing the defense of the evidence.\"\n\n\"Calling for the resignation of someone doesn't actually create the resignation,\" said Crowley, adding that he would wait for the ethics committee's investigation.\n\nThe very next day, Pelosi, Crowley, and Sanchez caved to their more junior colleagues and demanded Conyers' resignation.\n\nIt is unavailable whether Kathleen Rice, who is a distant family relative of this reporter, played a significant role in the internal dynamics that led to Conyers' resignation.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes Increased Spending in Fiscal Year 2016 Budget\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama announced on Saturday that the United States can afford the significant spending increases in his proposed fiscal year 2016 budget, which is set to be unveiled on Monday. In his weekly address, Mr. Obama argued that the federal government has the necessary funds for investments in infrastructure, education, and other priorities due to shrinking deficits. However, he also advocated for tax increases on the wealthy to fund his proposed $74 billion increase in spending.\n\nThe budget would also repeal the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration, potentially leading to higher spending in the future. The president's budget is expected to face opposition from the Republican-controlled Congress, setting the stage for a potential fiscal battle.\n\nIn the address, President Obama outlined his budget's key points, including investments in paid leave, child care, community college education, research, infrastructure, manufacturing, and expanded internet access. He emphasized the nation's deficit reduction over the past several years, stating that deficits have been reduced by about two-thirds since he took office.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while deficits have decreased, the national debt continues to rise. The national debt stood at $10.6 trillion when President Obama took office.\n\nRepublicans are countering President Obama's message of \"middle-class economics\" by advocating for measures aimed at assisting working families. House GOP leaders have proposed expanding the 529 college savings accounts, which allow families to save for college tax-free. The White House had initially proposed taxing these accounts, but withdrew the plan following heavy public criticism and private pressure from prominent Democrats.\n\nRepresentative Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) criticized the president's decision to abandon the 529 tax proposal, stating, \"It was a terribly misguided idea, but it took a public outcry for the president to realize it... First, the president should put his full weight behind our plan to expand and strengthen 529 accounts... Because we should be rewarding people who work hard and play by the rules\u2014not punishing them.\"\n\nRepresentative Jenkins also urged the president to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a measure that cleared the Senate this week but faces a potential veto from President Obama.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee to Receive Classified Document on Drone Policy\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee will receive a classified document on Thursday, which seeks to justify the administration's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks. The announcement was made by Dianne Feinstein, the committee's chairwoman, on Wednesday.\n\nThe document in question is the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion regarding the use of lethal force in counterterrorism operations. Feinstein stated that it is crucial for the committee's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations.\n\nThe development comes before the confirmation hearings for John Brennan, President Barack Obama's CIA director nominee. The president has directed the Department of Justice to provide the congressional Intelligence committees access to classified OLC advice related to the subject of the Department of Justice White Paper.\n\nThe 16-page white paper, titled \"Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaida or an Associated Force,\" is a policy paper rather than an official legal document.\n\nThe drone strikes, a significant part of John Brennan's legacy as the president's principal adviser on terrorism, have been a subject of controversy. According to a count by the public policy group New America Foundation, at least 28 of al Qaeda's leading members have been killed in drone strikes, including the U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe targeted killing of al-Awlaki, who was killed by a drone, and his teenage son in a separate strike, has been a point of contention for human rights groups in the United States. The justification for the attack was defended by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Rogers, on Wednesday.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing, John Brennan is expected to address the drone policy, among other issues. His stance on the legality of drone strikes, as expressed in a 2012 speech, is that they are legal under the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because they minimize collateral damage.",
    " Title: ACLU Seeks Mental Health Counseling for Separated Immigrant Children\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has requested a federal judge to order the U.S. government to establish a fund for providing mental health counseling to approximately 2,000 immigrant children who were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. The request was made in court papers filed on Thursday, following a turbulent week for U.S. immigration officials who failed to meet a court-ordered deadline for reuniting children under the age of five.\n\nThe ACLU's court filing comes after a lawsuit that led to U.S. Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego ordering the government to reunite families separated at the border last month. The family separation policy was part of President Donald Trump's efforts to curtail illegal immigration, which the administration ended last month following widespread protests.\n\nAccording to the court document, nearly half of the 103 children under five remain separated due to safety concerns, the deportation of their parents, and other issues. The ACLU also alleged that the government failed to communicate with the plaintiffs about the release of immigrants, a promise made to the judge.\n\nIn addition to mental health counseling, the ACLU also asked the judge to order the government to provide detailed information by Monday about all children not yet reunited and to expedite background checks and verifications of family relationships. The government must reunite all parents and the remaining children by July 26.\n\nThe government acknowledged in its Thursday court filing that it had missed the Tuesday deadline for reuniting the youngest children with their parents but said it had now complied with the judge's order. The government's struggle to reunite around 100 children under five has raised questions among immigration advocates about the coherence of their plan for reuniting the remaining families.\n\nImmigration officials have stated that the process was slowed by background checks, and in Thursday's court papers, they identified one parent with a warrant for murder in Guatemala and others with suspected human trafficking violations. Other parents were barred from being reunited for less serious violations, such as drunk driving convictions.\n\nIn a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, \"Throughout the reunification process, our goal has been the well-being of the children and returning them to a safe environment.\" Beth Krause, a supervising lawyer at the Legal Aid Society's Immigrant Youth Project, said, \"The reunification process has been chaotic and has unequivocally come at a cost.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Duncan Hunter Resigns Amidst Campaign Funds Misuse Case, Cites Congressional Accomplishments and Military Service\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) has tendered his resignation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, with an official departure set for January 13. The 42-year-old congressman pleaded guilty last month to a single count of conspiracy to misuse at least $150,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Hunter did not address his guilt or innoccy and instead highlighted his congressional achievements and emphasized his military service. Hunter joined the Marines following the 9/11 terror attacks and, in his letter, he detailed the ways he has helped his constituents improve their lives.\n\n\"I learned from an early age the importance of liberty, the value of patriotism, and what a strong and secure border can bring to a community,\" he said. \"During my time in Congress, I had the privilege of helping thousands of individuals in my district.\"\n\nHunter also expressed pride in giving a voice to military personnel and standing with those who protect the nation's freedoms. According to the indictment, Hunter and his wife spent part of the campaign funds on a birthday party for their daughter at an expensive hotel, as well as funding social outings with friends at a French bistro in Washington, D.C.\n\nProsecutors also accused Hunter of spending part of the money on extramarital affairs with lobbyists and congressional aides. His wife, Margaret, was also charged in the case but accepted a plea deal in June, which required her to testify against her husband. The couple could have faced up to decades in prison prior to their plea agreements.\n\nRepublicans enjoy an 11-point registration advantage over Democrats in California's 50th District.

    " Title: Georgia State Representative Erica Thomas and Eric Sparkes Dispute Allegations of Racial Harassment\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorgia State Representative Erica Thomas (D) and Eric Sparkes, a man she accused of racial harassment, have been embroiled in a dispute over an incident that occurred at a local Publix grocery store.\n\nOn July 20, Thomas took to Twitter, stating that a white man had verbally assaulted her, calling her a \"lazy SOB\" and telling her to \"go back to where she came from\" because she had too many items in the express lane. Thomas is nine months pregnant and her husband, who is on active duty, was not present to defend her.\n\nIn a subsequent Facebook live video, Thomas described the incident, stating, \"People are getting really out of control with this white privilege stuff.\" She explained that she was in the \"10 items or less\" aisle with more than the allowed number of items due to her pregnancy and the man, whom she later identified as Sparkes, approached her and made the racist remarks.\n\nHowever, Sparkes, who has since appeared at Thomas's press conference to challenge her story, denies the allegations. In a Twitter post, he stated, \"I walked into Publix, I bought my three items. There were three checkout lanes. One was express, the other two were empty. I kept my tongue shut. I went to pay for my items in one of the empty lanes.\"\n\nSparkes claimed that he was approached by Thomas, who had more than the allowed number of items in the express lane. He stated that he politely inquired about the situation with two customer service associates from Publix, who informed him that corporate policy did not allow them to do anything but that customers could speak up. Sparkes then left the store, thought about the situation, and returned to confront Thomas.\n\nAccording to Sparkes, he and Thomas exchanged words, and he stated, \"You're selfish.\" He claimed that Thomas approached him and made further comments, but he did not remember her exact words. Sparkes said he then called Thomas a \"selfish little b*tch.\"\n\nSparkes has since denied Thomas's claims that he told her to \"go back where you came from.\" He stated, \"Her words stating on Twitter and her Facebook video saying I told she needs to go back to where she came from are untrue. I'm Cuban. I'm not white.\"\n\nIn a further twist, Sparkes claimed that Thomas is using the incident for political gain, stating, \"This woman is playing the victim for political purposes because she is a state legislator.\" He added, \"I'm a Democrat and will vote Democrat for the rest of my life, so call me whatever you want to believe. For her political purposes, make it black, white, brown, or whatever. It is so untrue.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some supporting Thomas's account of the events and others supporting Sparkes's denial of the allegations. The full truth of the incident remains unclear, and further investigation may be necessary to determine exactly what transpired between Thomas and Sparkes at the grocery store.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Tax Return History: A Look Back at His Stance and Previous Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has faced mounting pressure to release more than two years of tax returns, a demand that he has so far resisted. Romney argues that two years of tax returns, including his full 2010 return and an estimate of 2011 tax information, are sufficient and that he has complied with the law.\n\nThis stance is consistent with Romney's position during his 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor. In that race, his Democratic rival, Shannon O'Brien, released her tax information and called on Romney to do the same. In May 2002, Romney stated, according to the Boston Herald, \"People who run for public office are exposed to extraordinary scrutiny and that's as it should be, but there are some things that are not required for release, that are private, and I think my own income taxes, and my net worth and so forth are things I'd like to keep between myself and my family.\"\n\nRomney's longtime strategist, Eric Fehrnstrom, cited the family's \"privacy\" and noted that state law did not require candidates to provide anything more than a financial disclosure form filed with the state Ethics Commission. However, Romney has also called for greater tax transparency in the past when it served his political purposes.\n\nIn the 2002 race, Romney sought to turn Enron into a campaign issue when it was revealed that O'Brien's husband, Emmett Hayes, had lobbying ties to the scandalized energy and commodities firm. Hayes had filed his taxes separately from O'Brien, and Fehrnstrom, then Romney's deputy campaign manager, demanded that O'Brien come clean about her husband's financial ties to Enron. \"Her hands are not clean,\" Fehrnstrom said, according to the Herald. \"She can't claim to be disclosing anything until she discloses the returns of her husband, the Enron lobbyist. Under Shannon O'Brien, the state Pension Board lost millions by buying Enron stock when it was collapsing - what is she hiding?\"\n\nFehrnstrom made the demand even as Romney was refusing to release his own returns, which drew accusations of hypocrisy from editorial boards. However, Fehrnstrom defended the campaign's posture, saying that O'Brien was trying to hide important information from voters by declining to reveal her husband's returns, while Romney was simply acting on principle.\n\nThe tax return issue also made an appearance in Romney's first political campaign, his 1994 Senate run against Ted Kennedy. In that race, Romney assumed the role of transparency advocate. \"It's time the biggest-taxing senator in Washington shows the people of Massachusetts how much he pays in taxes,\" Romney said in April of 1994, according to a report in the Boston Globe. Romney said he would release his own tax returns if Kennedy did, but the Senator refused, and so Romney did as well.",

Buttigieg, who is openly gay and married, stated, \"I wish the Mike Pence's of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\"\n\nButtigieg also referred to Pence when insisting that his gay marriage brought him \"closer to God.\" In response, Pence, who has been a staunch believer in traditional marriage for his entire political career, has not issued any comments to provoke such pointed remarks.\n\nSpeaking in response to the mayor's comments, the Vice President told CNBC that Buttigieg \"knows better\" than to say \"things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally.\" Pence added, \"He knows me, but I get it. You know, it's like, again, 19 people running for president on that side in a party that's sliding off to the left. And they're all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are.\"\n\nPence noted that, as governor of Indiana, he \"worked very closely with Mayor Pete\" and that they \"had a great working relationship.\"\n\nIn a separate response, Karen Pence, the Vice President's wife, also addressed Buttigieg's comments, declaring, \"In our country, we need to understand you shouldn't be attacked for what your religious beliefs are.\" She added, \"I think kids need to learn that, at a young age, that this is OK, what faith people have. We don't attack them for their faith.\"",

According to The \u2588\u2588\u2588, members of Carson's campaign team are set to meet on March 29 in Palm Beach, where Carson owns a mansion. The meeting aims to discuss the future of Carson's political endeavors, including the utilization of a 700,000-person mailing list, a Political Action Committee (PAC) supporting Carson as a potential vice presidential pick, and a potential speaking program for Carson.\n\nThe main focus of the meeting, according to sources, is to position Carson favorably for a potential vice presidential offer from Donald Trump, should he become the nominee. The attendees of the meeting include Ben Carson Jr., Robert Dees, Ed Brookover, Logan Delaney, and Mike Murray.\n\nWhen asked for comment, former campaign manager Ed Brookover directed inquiries to Hope Hicks, a spokesperson for Trump's campaign. Hicks did not respond to a request for comment. Shermichael Singleton, handling media requests for Carson, declined to answer questions. Delaney and Dees also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBrookover has already joined the Trump campaign, as announced in a press release last Friday. He will be heading up a \"Delegate Selection Team.\"\n\nAfter ending his presidential campaign at the Conservative Political Action Conference two weeks ago, Carson announced that he would be heading up the group My Faith Votes, which aims to mobilize Christian voters in the general election. Carson is the \"National Honorary Chairman\" of the group, according to their website.\n\nCarson has been more forgiving of Trump's past criticisms, dismissing the real estate mogul's comparison of his temperament to that of a child molester during the campaign. In a recent interview with Yahoo, Carson stated, \"You have to admit, to some degree, it did work. A lot of people believed him.\"\n\nThe exact details of Carson's role in a potential Trump administration remain unclear.

Despite the ongoing negotiations, there seems to be a lack of confidence that the system will fundamentally change.\n\nAs the White House and congressional leaders attempt to explain temporary fixes to the ongoing issues, the next few days will be crucial in determining the government's funding, the country's debt status, and the timing of future deadlines.\n\nPresident Obama has been praised for his commitment to preserving Obamacare and maintaining budget basics, but the House GOP remains a significant force, with many tea party members continuing to push for their agenda.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) described his actions as a \"divine and patriotic calling\" at the Values Voters summit, indicating that future shutdown and debt limit standoffs are possible. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, expressed his belief that the issue must continue to be raised.\n\nThe White House argues that they are not negotiating with those demanding a \"ransom\" and instead are merely listening and talking. They also express satisfaction in putting the House Republicans in a difficult position for statewide and national elections.\n\nHowever, the reality remains that, despite having a slim majority in one chamber of Congress, Republicans have successfully forced the president to choose between risking a global economic meltdown and accepting parts of their agenda.

    " Title: President Trump and Former President Obama's Differing Stances on Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, President Donald Trump condemned the chemical attack in Syria as \"reprehensible,\" attributing the heinous actions of the Bashar al-Assad regime to the past administration's perceived weakness and irresolution. This statement echoes Trump's campaign rhetoric, where he criticized former President Barack Obama's Syria policy.\n\nDuring the same time in 2013, as a private citizen, Trump advocated for the U.S. to stay out of the Syrian conflict. On Tuesday, Trump's statement did not specify any actions his administration might take in response to the recent attack or his future stance toward Assad. Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that the president's statement \"speaks for itself\" and that further discussions with allies will be held to determine the appropriate action.\n\nIn 2013, when the U.S. concluded the Assad regime had used chemical weapons, Trump tweeted that the U.S. should \"stay the hell out of Syria.\" As the conflict in Syria intensified and the Obama administration considered an expanded U.S. role, Trump remained consistent in his message, advocating for non-involvement and viewing Syria as not America's problem.\n\nIn August 2013, when the U.S. and international community concluded that the Syrian government had again used chemical weapons, the Obama administration was reportedly considering a military strike. Trump questioned the wisdom of such a move. On August 30, 2013, a U.S. intelligence assessment found more than 1,400 Syrians were killed in the chemical weapons attack. Trump's tweets focused on how that made the U.S. look.\n\nObama ultimately sought congressional approval to carry out strikes in Syria, a move widely seen as a way to back away from the red line he had drawn, shifting the responsibility for a decision to escalate involvement in Syria onto Congress. It became clear that Congress was unlikely to agree on authorizing force, and that they did not want the responsibility.\n\nOn September 5, 2013, Trump expressed concern that Obama had set the red line in the first place. A day later, Trump offered a seemingly joking solution: use Obamacare in Syria so \"they would self-destruct.\" Secretary of State John Kerry ultimately worked out a multinational agreement, including Russia, in which Assad would agree to give up his chemical weapons. Trump's assessment was not positive.\n\nIn the end, Trump concluded that Obama's handling of Syria made America look weak, a view that continues to be reflected in Trump's statements, as evidenced by his recent statement on Tuesday.",
    " Title: Obama Abandons College Savings Tax Plan Following Intense Lobbying Effort\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has rescinded a controversial plan to tax college savings accounts, known as 529 plans, following a lobbying effort led by key members of his own party. The decision comes after House Republicans expressed their intention to expand the tax break, aiming to highlight the president's reversal.\n\nSources report that the president was lobbied on Air Force One by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and received a call from House Budget Committee ranking Democrat Chris Van Hollen while flying from India to Saudi Arabia. Pelosi reportedly insisted that Obama drop the plan, effectively halting a policy that had been criticized for its potential negative impact on the middle class.\n\nThe president's proposal to tax 529 plans, which experts suggest primarily benefit upper-middle-class and wealthier families, was part of his broader plan to shift taxes to the wealthy and provide benefits to lower-income individuals. However, opposition to this specific element emerged swiftly, first from conservatives and then from mainstream groups and some Democrats.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Democratic aide confirmed that Van Hollen had expressed his concerns about the issue to Pelosi on Air Force One. The White House responded by abandoning the plan, with the president's other tax and education proposals remaining intact.\n\nHouse leaders are now planning to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor in late February for a vote, which aims to expand tax savings for 529s. This move provides Republicans another opportunity to showcase their small tax victory.\n\nRepublicans had criticized the White House's proposal from the outset, with anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist labeling it a plan to impose taxes on middle-class families saving for their children's education. The criticism continued, with House Speaker John Boehner issuing a statement Monday, quoting experts who argued the proposal would harm average Americans.\n\nDemocrats also voiced their concerns, with moderate Wisconsin Democrat Rep. Ron Kind joining Republican Kansas Rep. Lynn Jenkins to propose a bill to expand and strengthen 529s. This legislation is expected to be presented on the floor next month.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) expressed disappointment in the president's decision, urging him to collaborate with Republicans to pass the Rep. Lynn Jenkins' plan to strengthen and expand these important accounts.\n\nNot everyone shared the same sentiment, however. Former White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein suggested the White House might have been \"blindsided\" by the criticism of the tax plan, especially since it is a small part of a proposal that aims to boost college access for lower-income individuals. He argued that the White House could have adjusted the plan to allow lower-income individuals to continue using the accounts.\n\nSome left-leaning groups supported nixing the savings vehicle, attributing its demise to the perception that it was widely used by the middle class. However, data indicates that only 3 percent of families use the 529 plans, and the majority of these families make more than $200,000 per year. Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, former chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, stated that the average amount saved in such plans by Iowa families is less than $20,000.\n\nGrassley concluded, \"The tax code encourages all kinds of behavior, and saving for college is usually something everybody supports. The president's dropping his misguided plan is a victory for common sense.\"",

In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Trump expressed regret for choosing Sessions as attorney general. The White House stated on Thursday that Trump still has confidence in Sessions, but noted that dismissing Sessions would be within Trump's presidential authority.\n\nDespite the White House's assertion of confidence in Sessions, some of the most vocal pro-Trump voices are openly criticizing Sessions. Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told a Washingtonian writer on Wednesday, \"I know that Sessions does not have the confidence of the President. He should resign.\"\n\nGotNews writer Chuck Johnson suggested in a Facebook post on Thursday that Trump should fire Sessions and appoint Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as attorney general, stating, \"Cruz is pro-Constitution and an order of magnitude smarter than Sessions.\" Right-wing blogger Mike Cernovich, whose work Donald Trump Jr. has publicly praised, criticized Sessions as \"out of touch,\" adding that the attorney general \"has to go.\"\n\nNew York Post columnist Michael Goodwin called for Trump to fire Sessions even before the NYT interview. In a column on Monday, Goodwin wrote, \"He can begin by firing two other people \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein.\"\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity and radio host Rush Limbaugh have not explicitly called for Sessions' resignation or dismissal, but both have expressed dissatisfaction with Sessions. Hannity criticized Sessions on his radio show Wednesday for not reopening the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server.\n\n\"I don't know where Jeff Sessions is, maybe something's happening that we don't know about,\" Hannity said. He added, \"I'm like, OK, we have a new attorney general, statute of limitations have not gone anywhere, why isn't this woman being investigated?\"\n\nRadio host Rush Limbaugh similarly appeared to side with Trump over Sessions on Thursday. \"And this recusal just blindsided [Trump],\" Limbaugh said. \"I'll tell you why. I think Trump believed, since Sessions was so willing in the Senate to go against amnesty and to go against comprehensive immigration reform, I am convinced that Trump thought that Sessions was a fighter just like Trump sees himself. And then when Sessions recused, Trump was surprised.\"\n\n\"And if I were in Trump's shoes I would be so livid about [the Russia investigation] I wouldn't be able to contain myself the way he is. It is that absurd,\" Limbaugh added. \"This is totally ridiculous.\"",

During the debate, he was asked about Obama's planned trip to Cuba later this month, still governed by the communist Castro regime.\n\nWhen asked why the United States should not engage further with Cuba, Rubio argued that the U.S. changes had allowed money to flow to the Castro regime, stating, \"Nothing will change for the Cuban people... In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening.\" He further explained that the only result of \"the opening\" was that the Cuban government had more sources of money.\n\nDonald Trump, who currently leads Rubio in Florida polls, had previously stated that opening Cuba was acceptable. Under attack in the Miami debate from candidates trailing him in the polls and the mounting delegate count, Trump said, \"I want a much better deal with Cuba\" and reiterated a familiar line, \"We don't make any good deals.\"\n\n\"I do agree that something should take place,\" he added. \"After 50 years, it's enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal here.\"\n\nIn response, Rubio listed several anti-Castro grievances and was met with enthusiastic applause, drowning out attempts to ask Senator Ted Cruz, the son of a Cuban father and an American mother, the next question. Cruz was asked if he would break diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\nCruz responded, stating, \"The question illustrates 'a real difference between us' on foreign policy.\" Cruz claimed that Trump supports the \"same basic trajectory\" of policy as Obama and Hillary Clinton, Obama's first secretary of state, have established.\n\nJohn Kasich, the fourth man onstage, was asked if he would encourage U.S. companies to do business with Cuba.

The backlash stems from Stephanopoulos' donations to the Clinton Foundation and perceived bias in his reporting.\n\nTweets directed at Stephanopoulos include:\n\n- \"@GStephanopoulos I'll sign a petition to have you fired, you Clinton hack\" - Orwellian Apocalypse (@GoogleDoesEvil) May 15, 2015\n- \"@GStephanopoulos does Team Hillary write your copy, or do you simply clear it with them?\" - Mark Stickle (@MarkStickle) May 14, 2015\n- \"@GStephanopoulos And after that, new details on your $50,000 Clinton Foundation donation. Right? RIGHT?\" - Amy (@a_doodle) May 14, 2015\n\nAdditional tweets question Stephanopoulos' relationship with the Clintons, such as:\n\n- \"@GStephanopoulos Did George keep lookout for Hillary when Bill had female guests in the Oval Office? Asking for a friend\" - Beatlegal09 (@Beatlegal09) May 15, 2015\n- \"@GStephanopoulos come on midget man, the gig is up. You are a Clinton hack\" - Adorable Deplorable (@NoTransparency) May 15, 2015\n\nSome tweets also criticize Stephanopoulos' donation to the Clinton Foundation and his perceived bias in reporting, such as:\n\n- \"@GStephanopoulos You should donate to help Nepal! But maybe to an organization with better than 85% overhead\" - Beelzebub \u2019 s Tesseract (@CJHerod) May 15, 2015\n- \"@GStephanopoulos Any other news since yesterday? I heard about a biased stooge donating to a former boss's slush fund. You should cover it\" - Anthony Bialy (@AnthonyBialy) May 15, 2015\n\nFurther investigation reveals that Stephanopoulos donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation and is listed as a notable member of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2010 and 2011. ABC News admitted Stephanopoulos was a member but stated he did not pay any fees. Instead, the CGI listed him as a member because he moderated a panel for the foundation in those years.\n\nAndrew Stiles at the Washington Free Beacon contacted ABC about the donations, and ABC replied ten minutes after the left-wing site Politico broke the news. This led the Washington Post to demand ABC apologize for seemingly shopping around a scoop to a friendlier news outlet.",
    " Title: NFL Discusses Social Justice Issues, Not National Anthem Protests, at Annual Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nNational Football League (NFL) officials discussed social justice issues and political activism during their annual meeting in New York City on Tuesday, rather than addressing the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the U.S. national anthem. The meeting took place amid protests by demonstrators outside the venue, who showed support for the players.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters that the meeting focused on issues in the communities, aiming to make them better. President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of players for kneeling during the national anthem, which he reiterated as recently as Monday, has led to a wider practice of the silent protests.\n\nOutside the Manhattan luxury hotel where team owners, players, and their union leaders met, about two dozen people demonstrated their backing for the protesting athletes, kneeling on the sidewalk while holding placards that read \"Take a knee against police brutality.\"\n\nThe small but growing number of players who have taken to kneeling during the national anthem are protesting the killing by police of unarmed black men and boys across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the criminal justice system. More than half of all NFL players are black.\n\nGoodell appeared less interested in stifling the silent protests and instead praised players' character, saying he wanted to help their political activism. \"Today's discussion with our players was very productive and very important. It reflected our commitment to work together with our players on issues of social justice,\" said Goodell.\n\nGoodell, who cut his news conference off after one question, said the league will meet again with players, probably in the next two weeks, and will spend more time talking to reporters when the two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.\n\nAn NFL spokesman had said the president might not see an outright ban on the national anthem protests soon, if ever, and predicted that the meeting would focus on ways for all sides to work together.\n\nTeam owners and 13 players had a \"productive meeting\" of their own earlier on Tuesday at the league offices about how to collaborate on positive social change and addressing inequality, according to a statement by the NFL and the players' union, the NFL Players Association.\n\nPlayers and their union have bristled at Trump's assertion they are unpatriotic. Though still a minority, more players have begun kneeling since the new football season began, and some sympathetic teammates have linked arms with the kneelers while standing themselves.\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who first popularized the gesture last year, said he settled on kneeling as a form of protest because it is widely seen as a gesture of respect. Kaepernick, who is a free agent, was not invited to attend the meeting.",
    " Title: China Announces Tariffs on US Products Worth $60 Billion in Escalating Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nChina has announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on US products worth $60 billion, the latest move in an escalating trade conflict between the two nations. The Chinese government stated on Friday that it would levy duties of 25%, 20%, 10%, and 5% on the targeted products if the US administration follows through on threats to tax $200 billion of Chinese goods.\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese State Council Tariff Commission criticized the US for unilaterally escalating trade tensions, stating, \"In violation of the bilateral consensus reached after multiple rounds of negotiations, the United States has again unilaterally escalated trade frictions.\"\n\nChina has listed 5,207 US products that will be subject to these tariffs, with the aim of \"safeguarding its own legitimate interests.\" The targeted products include meat, coffee, nuts, alcoholic drinks, minerals, chemicals, leather products, wood products, machinery, furniture, auto parts, and more.\n\nIn response, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, stated, \"Instead of retaliating, China should address the longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices.\"\n\nThe US and China trade goods and services worth approximately $650 billion annually, making it the largest trading relationship between two countries worldwide. However, China exports far more to the US than vice versa, making it more challenging for the country to counteract US tariffs.\n\nThese new tariffs would affect about 38% of all American exports to China, which are worth approximately $170 billion in total.\n\nTrade tensions between the US and China have been escalating since April 2017, when President Donald Trump directed the US Commerce Department to investigate whether imports of steel and aluminum from China and other countries posed a threat to national security. The investigation led to tariffs on steel and aluminum products from China and many other countries in March. Beijing responded with equal measures.\n\nIn July, the US imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods to pressure China into abandoning what the Trump administration describes as unfair practices such as intellectual property theft. Beijing retaliated with penalties of an equal scale, targeting American products such as motorcycles and communications satellites.\n\nThe most recent threat from the Trump administration came this week, when it warned that it could impose steeper tariffs than originally planned on another batch of imports from China. The White House had previously considered imposing a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods; under the new plan, tariffs of 25% would be applied.\n\nProtectionist moves by the US have also drawn responses from other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, who have retaliated with their own tariffs in response to US taxes on steel and aluminum.",
    " Title: House Speaker Pelosi Announces Measures to Limit President Trump's Military Actions Regarding Iran\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans to introduce a War Powers Resolution aimed at limiting President Trump's ability to conduct military operations against Iran. The announcement comes in response to Trump's decision to conduct an airstrike in Iraq that resulted in the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force.\n\nPelosi and other Democrats have been critical of Trump's decision, claiming he did not properly notify Congress in advance and warning about the risk of escalation in the region. Trump has also threatened additional action if Iran retaliates for Soleimani's death.\n\nOn Saturday, the White House sent Congress formal notification of the drone strike under the War Powers Act, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The notification, required by law within 48 hours of the introduction of American forces into an armed conflict or a situation that could lead to war, had to be signed and sent to Congress.\n\nTrump has stated that \"legal notice is not required\" for him to take additional action, but claimed that his online posts provided notification to Congress that he \"will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner\" if Iran attacks \"any U.S. person or target.\"\n\nIran has vowed to retaliate and avenge Soleimani's death, and has announced they will be abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal, signaling threats of further nuclear proliferation. Trump had tweeted Saturday that even Iran's cultural sites were potential targets for U.S. military action.\n\nEarlier that day, Iraqi lawmakers approved a resolution calling to expel U.S. troops from the country, who were sent there more than four years ago to aid in the fight against the Islamic State terror group.",
    " Title: New York City's Jewish Community Faces String of Alleged Hate Crimes, Including Monsey Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of alleged hate crimes targeting Jewish institutions and individuals in New York City has left the Jewish community reeling. The most recent and horrific incident occurred on Saturday night in the suburb of Monsey, where a rabbi's home was attacked, leaving several people seriously wounded.\n\nThe alleged assailant, Grafton Thomas, entered the rabbi's home shortly after 10:00 p.m. during the seventh night of Hanukkah and began slashing people with a longsword. The motivations of Thomas are unknown, and friends report that he is mentally ill. However, he is an African American man, which may not necessarily indicate a connection to white supremacy, the alt-right, or the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, as some have suggested.\n\nIn May, during a U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties hearing, concerns were raised about a supposed rise in white nationalism and hate crimes. However, the perpetrators of these attacks in New York City are often not the MAGA-worshipping alt-right terrorists that the hearing was concerned about. According to Tablet's Armin Rose, the majority of the alleged perpetrators in New York are either black or Hispanic.\n\nFar-right anti-Semitism is not the only form of contempt for Jewish people. Campus leftism can sometimes be tinged with anti-Semitism, and progressive activists have associated with known anti-Semites. The Jersey City shooters had a connection to the Black Hebrew Israelites, a black nationalist cult best known for precipitating the Covington incident.\n\nIt is unclear whether Thomas, by virtue of being black, is a likely member of a group or an activist for a leftist or black nationalist cause. In fact, it would be unsurprising if he had no broader motivation. Murder is usually non-ideological, and just a tiny number of killings each year can be credibly connected to a political agenda.\n\nAccording to Batya Ungar-Sargon in Forward, there is little evidence that these attacks are ideologically motivated, at least in terms of the ideologies of hate that are most familiar. The left should not ignore anti-Semitism when its perpetrators are inconvenient targets who contradict the progressive doctrine of intersectionality. The same goes for the right, which often turns a blind eye to anti-Semitism among its own ranks.\n\nEveryone should be concerned and angry about attacks and intimidation directed at Jewish people, but it is also crucial to demand more reporting and more accurate reporting about the scale of the problem. Nationally, it is not clear that anti-Semitic violence is rising dramatically, as tallies often include anti-Semitic taunts, schoolyard bullying, and online writings. In New York City, anti-Semitic incidents increased by 53 percent from 2018 to 2019, according to the NYPD, but the overwhelming majority of anti-Semitic incidents are classified by police as \"criminal mischief,\" which typically means vandalism and graffiti. Just 13 percent of incidents involved violence.",
    " Title: New York State Senator and City Councilman Accused in Plot to Purchase GOP Spot in NYC Mayoral Race\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York State Senator Malcolm Smith, a Democrat, was arrested Tuesday morning and led from his Queens home in handcuffs for allegedly attempting to buy his way onto the Republican ticket in this year's New York City mayoral election. City Councilman Daniel Halloran, a Republican, and four other local politicians, all Republicans from the New York metropolitan area, were also arrested and stand accused of conspiring with Smith.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Smith agreed with a cooperating witness and an undercover F.B.I. agent, posing as a wealthy real estate developer, to pay off leaders of Republican county committees in New York's five boroughs. The bribes were intended to obtain specific certificates authorizing him to run for mayor as a Republican, despite being a registered Democrat.\n\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated in a statement that Smith \"drew up the game plan,\" while Halloran, the city councilman, \"quarterbacked\" the effort to find party chairmen in the state who were open to receiving bribes. Halloran was allegedly to receive $20,500 in exchange for supporting Smith's bid for the GOP nomination, while two other officials were to allegedly receive \" $40,000 in bribes with a promise of $40,000 more.\"\n\nSmith's lawyer, Gerald Shargel, told the Times that Smith \"is a dedicated and highly respected public servant and he steadfastly denies these charges.\" Smith, according to his official biography, first won election to the state senate in 2000. He was the state senate's president pro tempore when Democrats controlled the chamber in 2008-10. In recent years, however, he has often been at odds with his fellow Democrats.\n\nCurrent Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) is prevented from seeking a fourth term. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn is thought to be the leading contender for the Democratic nomination. The Republican frontrunner, according to the Daily News, is Joe Lhota. He was a deputy mayor during the administration of Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
    " Title: China Threatens Retaliation Against U.S. Tariffs, Pushes Back on Hong Kong Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nChina has responded to the looming U.S. tariffs, stating that the measures violate agreements reached by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. In a statement, the Chinese government vowed retaliation, without specifying the nature of its response. The U.S. and China are currently embroiled in a trade dispute, with both nations imposing tariffs on each other's goods.\n\nThe U.S. plans to impose 10% tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports, a move that has taken the two nations off the track of resolving their dispute through negotiation. The State Council Tariff Committee, which has overseen the tit-for-tat retaliation, stated that China \"has no choice but to take necessary measures to retaliate.\"\n\nIn a separate development, a foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman expressed hope that the U.S. would leave Hong Kong as an internal matter for the Chinese government to deal with. Trump has previously linked the trade war with the ongoing turmoil in Hong Kong, stating that an agreement with China has to be on \"our terms.\"\n\nU.S. stocks finished the day higher after a volatile session, with trade headlines causing investor unease. The U.S. has announced tariffs set for September 1 and December 15, while China has halted purchases of agricultural goods and allowed the yuan to weaken. However, top negotiators held a phone call earlier this week, and the U.S. delayed the imposition of some of the new import taxes.\n\nNegotiators also agreed to have another call in the coming two weeks, and people familiar with the situation said earlier that the Chinese delegation is sticking to their plan to travel to the U.S. in September for face-to-face meetings.\n\nChina's statement indicates that Beijing doesn't think the U.S. delaying some of the tariffs is enough. China is sticking to the position that no new duties should be imposed at all, and its retaliation \"may not be limited to tariffs.\"\n\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper, echoed this sentiment. He tweeted before the Thursday announcement that China wants both sides to respect the consensus reached when Trump and Xi met in Osaka in June. \"I doubt the Chinese side will resume large-scale purchase of U.S. farm goods under the current circumstances,\" he said.\n\nLess than 12 hours before the Chinese statement on retaliation, Trump appeared to float the possibility of another meeting with Xi. In a flurry of tweets, he defended his tariff decisions, praised Xi, and urged the Chinese president to \"humanely\" resolve the protests that have gripped Hong Kong for more than two months.\n\nChina's position on the trade negotiations has been consistent and clear. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, \"We hope that the U.S. side will do as what they say.\" China's position on Hong Kong is that it is a purely internal affair, and the U.S. should not interfere.\n\nTrump ended his Twitter post with an apparent overture to Xi, writing \"Personal meeting?\" without clarifying whether he was suggesting another summit. Hua said the two leaders \"have always kept in touch through meetings, calls, and letters.\"",
    " Title: Sequestration Threatens U.S. Military Readiness for Combat Missions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe automatic budget cuts known as sequestration could leave the U.S. military unprepared for the most challenging combat missions, according to the Pentagon. In April, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told Congress that the military is \"eating its seed corn.\" The cuts will heavily impact maintenance and training, further eroding the readiness of the force and will be costly to regain in the future, Hagel said.\n\nThe Air Force is reportedly in a special bind due to the cuts in flying hours. At Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, training flights are part of the daily routine. F-15 fighter jets roll down the flight line and launch into a cloudy sky. The base is home to the Air Combat Command's Fourth Fighter Wing, which is made up of four squadrons of fighters. They practice and practice so they can be ready to deploy anywhere in the world, at any time.\n\nHowever, the leadership has been told to save money, resulting in a reduction of flying hours. Lt. Col. James Howard, of the 336th Fighter Squadron, had to ground the squadron so that the other units on this base could keep flying. The longer the pilots remain idle, the longer it will take for them to get ready to fly again. Fighter pilots must fly and drill their skills on a regular basis, from dogfighting to helping ground troops under fire. Otherwise, they lose their certification.\n\nSome Pentagon budget hawks argue these complaints are part of the military's propaganda effort to avoid budget cuts. They say the military is hoping to win sympathy by deliberately cancelling high-profile programs, like appearances by the Blue Angels and Fleet Week in New York.\n\nRepublican Sen. John McCain argues that the military should be protected from these automatic cuts. On Meet the Press last month, McCain said Congress should do for the military what it did for the Federal Aviation Administration after travelers complained about flight delays caused by budget cuts.\n\nTodd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, suggests that Congress and the military are banking on the chance that next year the budget will be back to normal. In other words, it could be better to ground a few pilots now, hoping you won't have to make permanent cuts, like having fewer pilots or fewer planes.\n\nThe Pentagon hopes to get limited relief soon by asking Congress for permission to shift money around in order to protect top priorities like flying time. However, the long-term solution is a budget deal\u2014which is not even visible on the horizon.",
    " Title: Senate Rule Change Accelerates Confirmation of Obama's Judicial Nominees\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has witnessed a significant shift in the confirmation of judicial nominees under President Barack Obama, following a rule change initiated by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in November 2013. This rule change has enabled the Senate to confirm numerous judges, many of whom will hold lifetime appointments and extend the administration's influence for years to come.\n\nSince the rule change, the Senate has confirmed 68 district and circuit court judges, compared to 36 during the equivalent period of the 113th Congress before the rules change, according to Senate statistics. The rule change has rendered all nominees, except those to the Supreme Court, eligible for approval with a bare majority, as opposed to the previous requirement of a 60-vote supermajority to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThe rule change has been met with resistance from the Republican party, who have employed their remaining procedural tools to delay the approval of judges and executive branch nominees. However, the era of lengthy confirmation battles appears to be over.\n\nDemocrats argue that the rule change will leave a lasting impact on the courts, with the installation of liberal-leaning justices at various levels. Marge Baker, a vice president at People for the American Way, stated, \"The rules change has made a huge difference. The legacy of this Congress has been the impact that the president and the Senate have made with judicial vacancies.\"\n\nThe rule change has also been met with support from Democrats, who argue that it has cleared a backlog of judges and addressed judicial emergencies. However, the rule change has been criticized for contributing to a legislative stalemate and a decline in the Senate's efficiency.\n\nThe rule change has also had consequences for executive branch nominees, with Senate Republicans blocking a number of Obama's ambassadorial choices before the Senate recessed for August. In the pre-nuclear rule change days, the Senate might have unanimously approved a group of new ambassadors before recessing, but those days are over.\n\nThe effectiveness of the rule change remains a topic of debate, with both parties offering their perspectives on its impact. Confirmation rates are up, but the nomination process still moves slowly towards approval. The exact impact of the rule change on individual nominees is unclear, as it is impossible to determine which votes were made in protest of the rules change and which were made in protest of an individual nominee.\n\nDemocratic aides and researchers argue that at least 20 key judicial and executive nominees would have been blocked or delayed for months under the old rules. In their view, Jeh Johnson would not be Homeland Security secretary, John Koskinen would still be waiting for a vote, and former Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) would still be in Congress, not leading the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nThe rule change has been criticized for empowering the president and weakening the Senate's role as a check on the executive branch. A Senate Republican aide stated, \"It's empowered Obama and has taken power away from elected representatives that could offer a check on Obama.\" The GOP also argues that the Senate is less efficient than it was a year ago, with each nomination consuming an hour or more of the Senate's time.",
    " Title: National Poll Shows Ben Carson's Support Dropping Among Republican Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nA new national poll released today indicates a decline in support for 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson, who was previously leading the race for the Republican nomination. The neurosurgeon currently has 16 percent support, according to the Quinnipiac University poll, a drop of 7 percentage points in the last month. This places him behind frontrunner Donald Trump, who has 27 percent support, Sen. Marco Rubio with 17 percent, and Sen. Ted Cruz with 16 percent. All other GOP candidates have 5 percent or less support.\n\nIn early November, Carson was neck-and-neck with Trump for the lead. However, the new poll shows Carson in a battle with Rubio and Cruz, both of whom are seeing their highest support in months.\n\nThe decline in Carson's support can be attributed to doubts among Republican voters about his experience and leadership abilities. Only 42 percent of Republican voters now believe Carson has the right experience to be president, a significant drop from 64 percent four weeks ago. Similarly, only six in ten say he has strong leadership qualities, down from 76 percent in early November.\n\nCarson's fall in support has also affected other areas, including honesty and trustworthiness, and overall favorability, where Carson had been high. In a hypothetical general election match-up, his 10-point lead over Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton from last month has evaporated. The new poll shows 46 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Carson, respectively.\n\nClinton also improved in hypothetical faceoffs with Cruz and Rubio. Carson's 25-point lead among independents has disintegrated to just a single point, while Clinton now leads Carson by 16 points among women, where they had been neck-and-neck just four weeks ago.\n\nClinton still holds a wide lead on the Democratic nomination race, ahead 60 to 30 percent over Sen. Bernie Sanders. The poll shows Clinton solidifying support among women and liberals.\n\nThe new numbers were finalized before Carson's recent trip to Jordan to meet with Syrian refugees, a move aimed at bolstering his foreign policy credentials in the wake of the Paris attacks. However, most of Carson's support has dropped equally across the board, particularly among evangelical voters, where he dropped 13 points.\n\nTrump remains steady on the top of the national polls, the undisputed frontrunner less than two months from the Iowa caucuses.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Condemns White Nationalist Robocalls Ahead of Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to Wisconsin's primary election, Republican Governor Scott Walker has distanced himself from a series of racially charged robocalls made by the American National Super PAC and its white nationalist founder, William Johnson. The calls, which have been flooding Wisconsin landlines, support Donald Trump's presidential campaign and contain coded language that appeals to white nationalist sentiments.\n\nThe robocall, narrated by an elderly woman, promotes Trump as a candidate who \"will respect all women and help preserve western civilization.\" In the context of white nationalist rhetoric, this phrase is interpreted as a promise to maintain white supremacy and oppose immigration and welfare policies perceived as benefiting minorities.\n\nThe calls, while relatively mild compared to Johnson's previous efforts, have caused controversy due to their timing and the political climate in Wisconsin. Governor Walker, who built his political power base in the state's suburbs, has been criticized for his policies that disproportionately affect minority communities.\n\nThe New Republic published an in-depth article two years ago that examined the racial polarization in Milwaukee and its suburbs, where the chairman of one county's Republican Party referred to a predominantly African-American neighborhood as \"the colored section\" in 2014. White flight between 1960 and 2010 tripled the population of three rural counties around Milwaukee, while the percentage of African-American residents in those counties is under 2 percent. The black poverty rate within the city is the second-highest in the country.\n\nThroughout his political career, Governor Walker has implemented policies that have been criticized as harmful to minority communities, such as cutting funding for public transportation and advocating for private-school vouchers that have been accused of decimating public education. He has also supported privatizing prisons and cutting taxes, which have made it difficult to restore funding for these programs.\n\nThe racial polarization in Wisconsin has been fueled by talk-radio hosts like Charlie Sykes, who regularly traffics in white resentment politics. Sykes, who has referred to Michelle Obama as \"Mooch,\" has grown rich by spewing racial divisiveness, and has frequently featured Governor Walker as a guest.\n\nThe timing of the white nationalist robocalls, coupled with the implementation of Wisconsin's new voter-ID law, has added to the controversy. The law, which could disenfranchise as many as 300,000 mostly minority and student voters, is part of a broader Republican effort to limit the voting power of traditional Democratic constituencies. The law's implementation comes after the Supreme Court eviscerated the Voting Rights Act, which was first passed to protect the voting rights of minorities.\n\nGovernor Walker and his allies have condemned the robocalls and Trump as polarizing figures, but critics argue that the governor and his allies have a history of advocating for policies that disproportionately affect minority communities. Despite their denials, their actions and rhetoric have been criticized as inherently racist, and the white nationalist robocalls have simply brought this racism out into the open.",
    " Title: U.S. Stock Market Dips Amid Global Economic Uncertainty, but Experts Remain Calm\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestors experienced a turbulent Monday as the U.S. stock market followed Asian markets downward, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening with a significant 1,000-point drop. However, concerns about China's struggling economy do not necessarily signal a global recession, according to several analysts.\n\nOn Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 15,871.35 after a 3.6 percent decline, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index came close to a 4 percent decline. The selloff followed a 1,000-point drop over the previous five days. Outside the U.S., declines in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong were approximately 5 percent, with an 8.5 percent plunge on China's benchmark stock index prompting a \"Black Monday\" label in Shanghai news reports.\n\nFor shaken investors outside China, analysts suggest keeping Monday's swoon in perspective. Austan Goolsbee, a former top White House economic adviser now at the University of Chicago, told NPR that there are several factors that make him feel better now than in the fall of 2008. He cited the root of the crisis not being events happening in the United States, less borrowing involved in the current situation, and an equity bubble rather than a fundamental economic issue.\n\nForecasters expect the latest reading on economic growth, coming this week, will show US expansion at a pace slightly above 3 percent annualized. The volume of home sales ticked up positively in the latest monthly report, reaching the highest rate in eight years, and improvement in the job market has brought unemployment down to 5.3 percent of the labor force.\n\nWhile the effects of what happens in China may not stay in China, they shouldn't be exaggerated, according to forecasters. The cooling of China's economy ripples outward to affect emerging-market nations more than developed ones. For the U.S., this might have only small economic effects, perhaps modestly weaker export opportunities to emerging nations, offset by some positive benefits as Americans reap more gain than harm from sagging commodity prices.\n\nVolatility in the stock market can seem unsettling, but it serves a purpose, according to analysts. It can help avoid market bubbles by showing some tug and pull in the markets as investors collectively argue about appropriate prices for investments. For long-term investors, dips can be buying opportunities. With the S&P index down more than 10 percent from levels seen in July, some investment strategists see this as a good buying opportunity or perhaps getting close to it.\n\nFor millions of Americans, a preliminary hurdle is simply saving enough money to invest at all. According to one bankrate.com survey earlier this year, more than half of Americans have no money in stocks or stock mutual funds. For those saving for retirement, another hurdle is a \"twice-burned\" aversion to stocks, including among Millennials who were vicarious witnesses to the dotcom bust and Great Recession.\n\nDavid Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, acknowledges scenarios where things could go from bad to worse, even in the U.S. However, he calls such scenarios merely possible, \"not likely.\"",
    " Title: \"Media Madness: An Analysis of Howard Kurtz's Book on the Trump White House and the Press\"\n\nArticle:\n\nHoward Kurtz's latest book, \"Media Madness,\" offers an analysis of the tumultuous relationship between the Trump administration and the media. The book delves into the ongoing battle between the president and the press, which Kurtz frames as \"the war over the truth.\"\n\nKurtz, a Fox News commentator, attempts to apportion blame between both sides, but he is quicker to criticize the media for underestimating Trump's chances in the 2016 election than he is to lay blame at Trump's feet for his embrace of alternative facts.\n\nThe book portrays Trump as a surrogate for his electoral base of disenchanted white working-class voters, and therefore, according to Kurtz, should be afforded greater patience, even as he tramples on the truth. However, the book acknowledges that Trump is \"loose with his language,\" fails to \"vet\" his pronouncements, and \"sometimes regurgitates half-baked comments.\"\n\nDespite these admissions, Kurtz places the onus on the media, contending that it mistakenly takes Trump literally while arguing that Trump's casualness does not always merit a press-driven fusillade.\n\nThe book provides a detailed account of the White House as a chaotic, seat-of-the-pants operation, reminiscent of a cross between Lord of the Flies and Goodfellas. The book recounts several instances of Trump's anger and outbursts, such as his confrontation with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and his one-time campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\n\nThe book also sheds light on the power dynamics within the White House, including tensions between key figures such as Kellyanne Conway and Jared Kushner. The book portrays Conway as being displeased with Kushner's perceived attempts to limit her access to the Oval Office, while Kushner denies any involvement in the episode of palace intrigue.\n\nAs to be expected, Kurtz goes easy on Fox News, his current employer. He notes that Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro are Trump's favorite interviewers, but writes that the news desk can hold Trump's feet to the fire.\n\nHowever, the book comes up short as a critique of the media. While it captures the mainstream media's visible biases, it lets the president off way too easily. Kurtz bemoans the media's tarnished reputation but says little of Trump's. That's called stacking the deck.",
    " Title: FBI Surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr. and Comparisons to Trump Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe FBI conducted surveillance on Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, allegedly due to concerns about his associates' ties to the Russian government. The investigation involved electronic surveillance and the examination of salacious material of a sexual nature. The administration that initially authorized the spying has denied these allegations.\n\nIn a controversial article published by Standpoint, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer David Garrow details his discoveries about King's private behavior, which were met with resistance from various media outlets. The revelations, if true, suggest that King and the FBI had a complex relationship, with the FBI bugging hotel rooms where he stayed and investigating him in a manner that raises questions about the prurient nature of the investigation.\n\nThe allegations against King include participating in a rape and an orgy, offering advice during the alleged rape, and making suggestive comments to women. The FBI document alleges that King \"immediately and forcefully raped\" a woman while another watched, and that he made lewd comments during an orgy the following day.\n\nGarrow, who has written extensively about King, comes to these conclusions after reading FBI summaries of audio surveillance of King. The tapes remain under lock-and-key at the National Archives until 2027. The raw FBI reports, particularly those that rely on informants, often contain gossip, rumors, and lies told by those seeking advantage. However, because these reports come straight from audio tapes, their level of authenticity may be higher than other information gathered by the bureau.\n\nThe allegations against King have been met with a curious indifference from the American media, with some suggesting that the allegations are too off-putting to report. The allegations have made headlines in other countries, but have received little attention in the United States. Some have suggested that the allegations put a damaging spotlight on King's historical stature and require a thorough historical review.\n\nThe comparison between the FBI's surveillance of King and the investigation into Donald Trump in 2016 is uncanny, but the parallels diverge when it comes to media coverage. While the Trump investigation has been the subject of extensive media coverage, the allegations against King have received little attention in the United States. The allegations against King may or may not be true, but they raise questions about the FBI's actions and the behavior of a historical figure who is often revered as a secular saint.",
    " Title: Two Minnesota Republicans Allegedly Physically Assaulted by Unidentified Individuals\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo Republican politicians in Minnesota have reported physical attacks in the past few days, according to reports from The Associated Press and the Star Tribune.\n\nState Representative Sarah Anderson (R) was allegedly assaulted on Sunday by an unidentified male who she confronted after finding him damaging her yard signs. Anderson told the AP that police have a tentative identification of the man who punched her during the confrontation, and they plan to interview him.\n\nAnother Republican, Shane Mekeland, a candidate for Minnesota House District 15b, was attacked on Friday during a campaign event at a bar, according to the Star Tribune. Mekeland was left with a concussion, and his attacker made a statement, not specifically aligned with either party, that indicated anger towards Mekeland for supposedly abandoning the middle class.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and former Attorney General Eric Holder (D) have faced criticism in recent months for calls to protest GOP candidates and lawmakers. Holder, who served under former President Obama, responded on Twitter last week, stating, \"OK, stop the fake outrage. I\u2019m obviously not advocating violence. (In fact, when I was AG, violent crime in the US was historically low.)\" He went on to say, \"Republicans are undermining our democracy and Democrats need to be tough, proud, and stand up for the values we believe in - the end.\"",
    " Title: Walter Shaub Resigns as Director of Office of Government Ethics, Cites Desire for Greater Freedom to Push for Ethics Reforms\n\nArticle:\n\nWalter Shaub, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), announced his resignation on Thursday, ending a tenure marked by frequent clashes with the Trump administration. In a letter to the president, Shaub expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to lead the OGE's staff and the community of ethics officials in the federal executive branch.\n\nShaub, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2013, will resign on July 19, six months before his term was set to conclude. He has accepted a position as senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, a group advocating for transparency and ethics in government.\n\nDuring President Donald Trump's tenure, Shaub and the administration have clashed over issues including the steps taken by the president to distance himself from his business empire and the administration's disclosure of ethics waivers for former lobbyists serving in the White House. Shaub stated in an email to The Wall Street Journal that he was not pushed out by the White House, but rather chose to leave before the end of his term due to the Campaign Legal Center offering him a platform for greater freedom to push for changes to federal ethics rules.\n\nThe White House accepted Shaub's resignation and plans to nominate a successor \"in short order,\" according to the White House. The Office of Government Ethics aims to prevent conflicts of interest for government employees but has limited means to enforce federal ethics rules, aside from publicly raising questions about possible conflicts.\n\nShortly after Trump's election victory, Shaub made it clear that he would not hesitate to criticize the president over ethics issues. In November, the ethics office sent a series of tweets at Trump urging him to divest fully from his business interests. In January, Shaub denounced as insufficient Trump's proposal to guard against conflicts of interest, stating it did \"not comport with the tradition of our presidents over the past 40 years.\"\n\nTrump placed his assets into a trust and turned over management of his business to his adult sons, but retained ownership of the business. He can withdraw funds from the trust if its trustees\u2014his eldest son and a longtime company lawyer\u2014deem it appropriate. In an interview with CBS News on Thursday, Shaub again criticized the president for not taking adequate steps to distance himself from his business.\n\nIn March, Shaub criticized the White House for not taking more aggressive action against senior adviser Kellyanne Conway after she urged viewers in a television interview to \"go buy Ivanka's stuff,\" referring to the brand owned by Trump's elder daughter. The White House said it had counseled Conway on the issue and determined she was unlikely to again break the federal law barring government officials from endorsing brands.\n\nIn May, Shaub issued an unusually forceful response to an effort by the White House to block the ethics office's attempt to obtain its ethics waivers, which allow administration officials to work on issues they handled in their previous private-sector jobs. Shaub declined the request that his office suspend its effort to obtain the waivers and included hundreds of pages of material backing up his right to request them. The White House ultimately provided the waivers to the agency, which publicly disclosed them.\n\nThe departure of Shaub means that Trump has the power to appoint a successor. A director must be confirmed by the Senate and is appointed to serve a five-year term. Don Fox, who served as the ethics office's general counsel from 2008 to 2013 and as acting director from 2011 until 2013, said Shaub was \"far more outspoken\" than his predecessors about \"what he perceived as the ethical shortcomings of this administration.\"\n\n\"Walt spoke out because he felt he had to,\" said Fox, adding he couldn't think of another administration \"that was ever this disdainful of government ethics.\" A White House spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment on Fox's criticism.\n\nIn a statement released by the Campaign Legal Center, Shaub said he hoped in his new role to bolster federal ethics rules. \"In working with the current administration, it has become clear to me that we need improvements to the existing ethics program,\" he said. \"I look forward to working toward that aim at Campaign Legal Center, as well as working on ethics reforms at all levels of government.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Push Forward with Full Repeal of Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republican leaders are advancing with plans to hold a vote on Wednesday to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, following a debate on the repeal measure on Tuesday. This is the second full repeal vote in the chamber, two weeks after the Supreme Court upheld most of the law as constitutional.\n\nThe vote on Wednesday is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, and President Obama has vowed to veto any such measure if it reaches his desk. Since 2011, the House has held 29 other votes aimed at dismantling specific parts of the law.\n\nThe House Rules Committee allotted five hours of floor debate for the latest measure, with lawmakers discussing the issue for four and a half hours on Tuesday. The remaining time is reserved for the day of the vote.\n\nDemocrats criticized the Republicans for focusing on repealing the health care law instead of addressing economic issues. Representative Keith Ellison, D-Minn., stated, \"We could spend five hours talking about jobs. We could consider a jobs plan that the president offered before this very body. But we won't, because we have to go repeal health care again for the thirty-first time.\"\n\nDemocrats also argued that the Supreme Court's ruling to preserve the law indicated that Republicans should focus on other issues. Representative Donna Edwards, D-Md., said, \"It's time for Republicans to move on.\"\n\nRepublicans maintained their stance on the issue, which they believe helped secure their majority during the 2010 midterm elections. They argued that the high court only declared the law constitutional, not good policy. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., stated, \"House Republicans promised the American people that if granted the majority, we would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Let's face it, ObamaCare is nothing like what was promised.\"\n\nRepublicans reaffirmed their commitment to repealing the law. Representative Lee Terry, R-Neb., said, \"I have voted to repeal this 30 times, and I will keep doing it until we get it right.\"",
    " Title: Republican Leaders Remain Silent on Trump's Threat to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of President Donald Trump's direct attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Republican party appears to be in a state of silence regarding potential constitutional crisis. Despite some Republicans having previously signed on to legislation preventing Trump from unilaterally firing Mueller, there seems to be a lack of urgency as they claim Trump is not currently planning to do so.\n\nHowever, key Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John Thune, Richard Burr, Chuck Grassley, Kevin McCarthy, Devin Nunes, Bob Goodlatte, and a majority of the other Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have not provided comments on the matter.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan's spokesperson stated that \"As the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\" This statement does not indicate any concrete action or consequences for firing Mueller.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio stated on Meet the Press that he remains confident that Mueller's investigation will be fair, thorough, and arrive at the truth. Sen. James Lankford described Trump as \"exceptionally frustrated,\" but did not offer any suggestions for action when Trump lashes out in frustration.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) expressed hope that enough people would prevail on the president to not fire Mueller, stating, \"I hope that that's the case. And I would just hope that enough people would prevail on the president now: \u2018Don't go there.\u2019\"\n\nFlake's comments suggest a general reluctance among Republicans to take action until after Trump has acted, implying a lack of proactive measures to prevent a potential constitutional crisis. The silence from key Republican leaders leaves the future of the Mueller investigation uncertain.\n\nIn the meantime, calls for donations to Democratic nominee funds in targeted districts and nominee funds in Nevada and Arizona have been made, indicating a growing concern among some Americans for the future of the investigation and the potential consequences of Trump's actions.",
    " Title: Five Memorable Anecdotes from Hillary Clinton's Book on the 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton's book, \"What Happened,\" detailing her experiences during the 2016 election, is set to hit bookshelves on Tuesday. The book is described as the story of \"what I saw, felt, and thought during two of the most intense years I've ever experienced.\" Here are five of the most memorable anecdotes shared by Clinton in her book.\n\n1. President Obama's Encouragement: Clinton writes that President Obama signaled to her early in 2013 and 2014 that she should run for president. Obama's support, according to Clinton, meant a great deal to her, as he believed she was the Democratic Party's best chance to hold the White House and continue their progress.\n\n2. Advice from George W. Bush: As Clinton decided whether to attend President Trump's inauguration, she sought advice from former President George W. Bush. Bush, who had his own family disagreements with Trump, advised Clinton to go to the inauguration, arguing it was for the good of the country.\n\n3. Mistaken Identity: Clinton mistook former Rep. Jason Chaffetz for Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus when he approached her on Inauguration Day. Chaffetz, who had been critical of Clinton during the Benghazi investigation, captured the moment on Twitter. Clinton, in her book, admitted that she \"came this close\" to tweeting back at Chaffetz, saying she thought he was Priebus.\n\n4. Ryan Zinke's Introduction: During the lunch at the Capitol following the swearing-in ceremony, Clinton describes an awkward encounter with Trump's soon-to-be Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke. Zinke, who had previously called Clinton the \"antichrist,\" introduced Clinton to his wife. Clinton wrote that she was surprised by the introduction and reminded Zinke that he had called her the \"antichrist.\"\n\n5. Huma Abedin's Loyalty: After the FBI reopened an investigation to examine emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop, Clinton writes that some people thought she should fire longtime adviser Huma Abedin, Weiner's wife. Clinton, however, chose to stand by Abedin, stating that she had done nothing wrong and was an invaluable member of her team.\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning on election night, Clinton writes that she and her husband were alone, exhausted after ten years without sleep. Clinton writes that they lay down on the bed and stared at the ceiling, with Bill taking her hand and the two of them remaining silent.",
    " Title: Taylor Swift Endorses Democratic Candidates in Tennessee Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nPop superstar Taylor Swift has endorsed two Democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm elections in Tennessee. In an Instagram post on Sunday, Swift announced her political stance and expressed her support for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives.\n\nSwift wrote, \"I'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee.\" She further stated, \"I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old singer expressed her opposition to Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who is running for the Senate. Blake Kitterman, vice president of Tennessee Young Democrats, told NPR that Swift's endorsement could potentially influence many young voters.\n\nKitterman said, \"The basic values that she has as a person, and that I would hope everyone else in the country has, do not really surprise me. It's a clear cut choice between Marsha Blackburn and Phil Bredesen, and I'm happy and reassured that she supported the right candidate in my mind.\"\n\nSwift's Instagram post highlighted her stance on LGBTQ rights, gender, and racial equality, and her opposition to candidates who do not support these values. She wrote, \"I can not vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender, or who they love.\"\n\nAndy Cole, the vice chairman of the Tennessee Young Republicans, expressed doubt about the impact of Swift's endorsement on young voters. Cole said, \"We've seen celebrities endorse Democrats before. Most Tennessee voters are worried about which candidate is going to give them a good job, which candidate is going to get out and fix the education system, which candidate is going to do the things Tennessee voters need... We're glad she has an opinion, and we love to see younger people have opinions, because frankly, I think too often, younger people have been disengaged.\"\n\nAccording to a study by Pew, millennials are among the most liberal generations in the U.S., with the majority supporting Democrats in their districts. However, young voters are not showing up at the polls, with only 20% of young people between the ages of 18 and 24 voting in the past four midterm elections.\n\nIn her post, Swift urged her young fans to vote in November. Kitterman of the Tennessee Young Democrats said that even without Swift's support, an increasing number of younger voters will be turning out to vote this year. Kitterman said, \"There are multiple threats now going against us, and I think that is a factor in pushing millennial turnout.\" He added, \"Taylor Swift only reinforces this built-up tension that we have in ourselves. Whereas before we thought that we could have no impact, now we have no choice but to exhaust all options to try and make an impact.\"\n\nAccording to a recent poll by The Tennessean and CBS, Blackburn has surged to an eight-point lead over Bredesen.",
    " Title: US-Israeli-Palestinian Tensions Escalate as US Abstains from UN Vote on Israeli Settlements\n\nArticle:\n\nThe prospect of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in jeopardy, according to US Secretary of State John Kerry. In a speech, Kerry criticized Israeli settlements on occupied land, stating they are a major obstacle to peace and a violation of international law. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by accusing Kerry of an unbalanced approach and paying \"lip service\" to Palestinian terrorism.\n\nThe UN Security Council passed a resolution last Friday, calling for an end to Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The US chose not to veto the resolution, leading to an angry response from Israel. The issue of Jewish settlements is one of the most contentious points between Israel and the Palestinians, with more than 500,000 Jews living in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation.\n\nThe two-state solution, a final settlement that would create an independent state of Palestine within pre-1967 ceasefire lines, is the declared goal of Israeli and Palestinian leaders and many international diplomats. The United Nations, the Arab League, the European Union, Russia, and the United States routinely restate their commitment to the concept.\n\nKerry emphasized that the two-state solution is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state. He criticized the current Israeli government, stating that its policies are leading towards a one-state solution rather than a two-state solution.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by saying he was disappointed with Kerry's speech, which he described as \"unbalanced.\" Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, stated that Palestinians have adhered to past agreements but Israel has not.\n\nDonald Trump, the US President-elect, has made it clear he has no plans to push Israel into a corner. In two tweets issued on Wednesday, Trump expressed support for Israel and criticized the UN for treating Israel with disdain and disrespect. Critics have urged the president-elect to use more conventional channels to communicate on international matters.\n\nThe UN resolution passed last Friday stated that the establishment of settlements has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. The US decision to abstain infuriated Mr. Netanyahu, who has taken diplomatic reprisals against the countries that voted in favor of the resolution. Meanwhile, an Israeli committee has postponed a vote to authorize construction of almost 500 new homes in Jewish settlements in occupied East Jerusalem.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Gubernatorial Race: Walker and Burke in a Tight Race as Election Day Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of his recall election victory in 2012, Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin was hailed as a conservative icon, having successfully stripped public unions of their bargaining powers and surviving a union-led campaign to remove him from office. However, in the lead-up to the 2014 gubernatorial race, Walker appears to be in a tight contest against his Democratic opponent, Mary Burke, a former Trek Bicycle executive and member of the Madison School Board.\n\nWalker, who once confidently lectured Mitt Romney in 2012, now finds himself in a challenging position against Burke. In the final days of the campaign, the governor has been vocal about his record on job creation, a contentious issue in his political history. Despite his efforts to remind voters of his victory over the unions, Walker has also emphasized his plea for voter support to continue his economic policies.\n\nAt campaign events this week, Walker has been visibly strained, coughing and wearing a bandage on one thumb from a hunting accident. In a departure from his previous campaign, Walker and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, have focused on smaller accomplishments, such as sending a $322 rebate to Wisconsin taxpayers this year. Walker has also received applause for his proposal to require drug tests for recipients of public assistance.\n\nAs the election day approaches, both Walker and Burke appear to have support from approximately 47% of voters, according to Walker's own estimates. The remaining votes are expected to come from \"Obama-Walker voters,\" Wisconsinites who may have voted against Walker in the 2012 recall but for President Obama in the same year. President Obama campaigned for Burke in Milwaukee on Tuesday, praising her as a \"practical person\" who understands the importance of creating jobs without prioritizing political ideology.\n\nThe Wisconsin gubernatorial race remains closely contested as both candidates seek to win over undecided voters in the final week of the campaign.",
    " Title: Mass Shooting in Las Vegas Leaves 59 Dead, 515 Injured\n\nArticle:\n\nAt least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert. The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000. He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found.\n\nThe shooting occurred during the final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out. Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits, or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point.\n\nInvestigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from the so-called Islamic State. In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as \"pure evil.\" He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their \"miraculous\" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday.\n\nWith First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn. The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck.\n\nStephen Paddock, from a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite north-east of Las Vegas, booked into the hotel on 28 September, police say. His motives for carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history remain a mystery. Some investigators have suggested psychological issues, but there is no confirmation of this.\n\nHis brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way. Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a \"lone wolf\" attack. \"We have no idea what his belief system was,\" he said.\n\nSo-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed to be behind the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: \"We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organization.\"\n\nThe investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property. Paddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again. Police say he used some of her identity documents to check in to the Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed. Jordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been identified as a victim of the attack by CBC News. A nurse, Sonny Melton, of Big Sandy, Tennessee, has been named as another victim by The Jackson Sun newspaper.\n\nIn a Facebook post, his wife, Dr Heather Gulish Melton, said she \"lost my true love and knight in shining armor. I appreciate the prayers but I just need some time.\" An off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died.\n\nThe scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar. They fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos. For a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves.\n\nAnd now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief, and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning. For a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this. But even for this country, what happened here is carnage on a different scale. Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately.\n\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.",
    " Title: Ian Bremmer Apologizes for Fabricated Quote Attributed to President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIan Bremmer, a journalist and New York University professor, has admitted to fabricating a quote attributed to President Donald Trump. In a tweet on Monday, Trump criticized Bremmer for the \"completely ludicrous quote\" he had attributed to him.\n\nIn the fabricated quote, Bremmer claimed Trump had said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would make a better president than former Vice President Joe Biden. Bremmer initially defended the quote, stating it was \"plausible\" and a commentary on the \"state of media and the twitterverse today.\"\n\nHowever, after Trump's tweet on Monday, Bremmer apologized, stating his initial post was \"meant in jest.\" He added, \"The President correctly quoted me as saying it was a 'completely ludicrous' statement.\"\n\nDuring his four-day state visit to Japan, Trump had tweeted about Kim Jong Un calling former Vice President Biden a \"Swampman\" and a \"low IQ individual & worse.\" Bremmer's fabricated quote was not mentioned in Trump's tweets during the visit.\n\nThis is not the first time Bremmer has been criticized for his comments about Trump. In 2016, he was accused of making inappropriate comments about Trump's wife, Melania, during a television appearance. Bremmer later apologized for those comments.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Second Presidential Debate: A Closer Look at the Candidates' Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the town-hall style debate at Hofstra University on Tuesday, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney faced off in their second debate. With Obama aiming to recover from a lackluster performance in the first debate and Romney seeking to deflect attacks that did not come his way last time, the truth sometimes got caught in the crossfire. Here is a factual analysis of how closely the candidates adhered to the facts during the debate:\n\nObama: \"I said that this was an act of terror.\"\n\nWhile Romney contested that Obama never made this statement, on the day after the Benghazi attack, the president did strongly suggest it was a terrorist strike. However, he did not say outright that the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism.\n\nOn the day after the death of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans, Obama stated, \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\" The ambiguity in this statement has been a point of contention, with Romney and his supporters arguing that the president was speaking broadly and not about the Benghazi attack specifically.\n\nIn the days following the attack, the White House seemed reluctant to call it a terrorist attack. On Sept. 16, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice went on several TV talk shows and declared that the U.S. government's preliminary assessment was that the violence sprang from a \"spontaneous\" demonstration related to an anti-Muslim video.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper has stated that Rice's account was based on the initial take of U.S. intelligence agencies. They subsequently changed their view and now assess the incident as a pre-planned terrorist attack.\n\nObama: \"Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board 20 percent, along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates changes in the Tax Code \u2014 it costs about $5 trillion.\"\n\nGov. Romney's tax plan is estimated to cost $5 trillion \u2014 including the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts. Obama's math overshot by about $1 trillion, by most estimates.\n\nThe president said Romney's budget plan would cost $8 trillion \u2014 $5 trillion in tax cuts, $2 trillion in additional military spending, and $1 trillion from the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Romney's tax plan is estimated to cost $5 trillion \u2014 including the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.\n\nRomney says that he would offset the cost of those tax cuts, in part by eliminating or scaling back taxpayers' ability to take credits and deductions. He has not given full details, but again floated the idea of a $25,000 cap on deductions, as he did in the first debate. Before that, he had discussed a $17,000 cap.",
    " Title: Missouri Fails to Override Veto on Controversial Gun Measure by One Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a narrow vote, the Missouri legislature failed to override the governor's veto of a bill that aimed to nullify federal gun regulations, including background checks and restrictions on high-capacity magazines. The vote was 23-13 in the state Senate, falling one vote short of the required two-thirds majority.\n\nThe bill, which was designed to make Missouri a sanctuary for gun-toting felons and the mentally ill, has been criticized for its potential violation of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. The clause states that the Constitution and federal laws are the supreme law of the land, and any state laws to the contrary are invalid.\n\nThe claim that a state can unilaterally nullify federal law has been widely criticized as preposterous, even by some of the strongest gun advocates. Robert Levy, who led the litigation to establish the individual right to bear arms, has conceded that the Missouri bill flouts the Constitution.\n\nThe controversy over gun policy in the U.S. has been a contentious issue, with some states, such as Colorado and Iowa, adopting stricter gun control measures, while others, like Missouri and Kansas, are pushing for more lenient gun laws. The debate has been marked by heated rhetoric, with the National Rifle Association (NRA) often at the center of the controversy.\n\nThe NRA has been criticized for its role in recall elections in Colorado, where two legislators who supported stricter gun control measures were removed from office. The NRA has also been accused of misleading voters and pushing for unconstitutional laws.\n\nThe failure of the Missouri bill to override the governor's veto is a significant development in the ongoing gun control debate. The NRA and its supporters have vowed to continue their efforts to push for lenient gun laws, while gun control advocates are calling for more responsible gun ownership to prevent tragedies.\n\nThe debate over gun control is complex and emotional, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. It is essential for voters to be well-informed and to consider the potential consequences of their decisions. The gun control debate is far from over, and it will likely continue to be a contentious issue in the U.S. for the foreseeable future.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Decides to Prosecute Osama bin Laden's Son-in-law in Civilian Court, Sparking Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to prosecute Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, in a federal court in New York City instead of a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay has reignited a debate over how to deal with suspected terrorists. This decision also recalls one of the largest unfulfilled promises of President Obama's presidency: his pledge as a candidate in 2008 to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nAs Abu Ghaith pleaded not guilty to conspiring to kill Americans in a New York Federal Court today, Republicans in Congress were criticizing the Obama administration for prosecuting a suspected al Qaeda terrorist in a civilian court, just about a mile from the 9/11 memorial built over Ground Zero.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrote in a statement, \"Abu Ghaith has sworn to kill Americans and he likely possesses information that could prevent harm to America and its allies. He is an enemy combatant and should be held in military custody.\"\n\nThe White House claimed there was a \"broad consensus\" across the federal government, from the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security, to prosecute OBL's son-in-law in civilian court.\n\n\"The intelligence community agrees that the best way to protect our national security interests is to prosecute Abu Ghaith in an Article III court,\" Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today. \"We're able to question him as a part of the regular process in detaining individuals like this, but we're also able to put him through Article III courts to ensure that he's held accountable for his crimes.\"\n\nStill, McConnell said that the administration's justification \"makes little sense\" and the intelligence community \"deserve the same access to intelligence and methods of defeating the enemy available to the team that found Bin Laden.\"\n\n\"At Guantanamo, [Abu Ghaith] could be held as a detainee and fully and continuously interrogated without having to overcome the objections of his civilian lawyers,\" McConnell said.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said civilian court \"is not the appropriate venue\" and the administration \"should treat enemy combatants like the enemy.\"\n\n\"Al Qaeda leaders captured on the battlefield should not be brought to the United States to stand trial,\" Rogers said. \"The president needs to send any captured al Qaeda members to Guantanamo.\"\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, who opposes closing Guantanamo and previously fought against efforts by the Obama administration to prosecute 9/11 suspects in New York City, said the speaker \"agrees\" with Rogers.\n\nNew York Republican Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., said he preferred that Abu Ghaith face trial in a military tribunal rather than civilian court, and he questioned what type of standard today's hearing could set.\n\n\"While a federal court trial of Abu Ghaith in lower Manhattan would not present the same security issues as a trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, I strongly believe as a matter of policy that military tribunals are the proper venue for enemy combatants,\" said King, a member of the House committees on Intelligence and Homeland Security. \"If the Abu Ghaith trial does go forward in federal court, it must not be used as a precedent for future enemy combatants who should be tried at Guantanamo.\"\n\nHowever, not all members of Congress oppose the administration's actions. New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who represents the congressional district where Ground Zero is located in lower Manhattan, said he is \"pleased Sulaiman Abu Ghaith will have to face justice in New York.\"\n\n\"I have long urged that we try terrorists in our civilian courts under the laws of the United States. We have done so successfully in the past, and we must continue to do so,\" Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"We are a nation committed to the rule of law, and we will demonstrate our values to the world even in the face of the most despicable mass murder in our history.\"",
    " Title: Marco Rubio's Proposal for Border Control Strategy in Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nMarco Rubio, a key member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight, is advocating for a change in the immigration reform bill currently under deliberation in the Senate. Rubio is pushing for Congress, rather than the Department of Homeland Security, to write the border control strategy that would be a prerequisite for most of the other elements of reform.\n\nRubio's proposal is a response to concerns about border security, a threshold issue for many Republicans. Rubio argues that Americans don't trust the government to get it right and wants lawmakers to craft the plan at the outset, rather than leaving the details to the Obama administration.\n\nThe Gang of Eight, a group of four Democrats and four Republicans, is aiming to secure as many as two dozen Republican votes to demonstrate the bill's bipartisan support and compel the House to act. However, the group must maintain the support of the vast majority of Senate Democrats who favor the current version of the bill.\n\nReform proponents are concerned that the Senate supermajority may be an elusive goal, potentially undermining the bill, particularly on border security. Marshall Fitz, a veteran of the 2006 and 2007 reform fights, expressed this concern, stating, \"We are advocating for a strong and tight and effective a bill as possible. If that means we are targeting 62 votes, then 62 on a strong bill is better than 75 on a weak bill that looks like a special interest bonanza.\"\n\nRubio has expressed doubts about the current version of the legislation's ability to garner enough votes to break a filibuster, let alone the 70-plus votes that Gang of Eight leaders want. Rubio has stated that many Republicans view border security as a threshold issue, and the requirements must be tightened before they can consider backing the bill.\n\nRubio's influence in the Gang of Eight deliberations is significant, with the group making several concessions to accommodate his preferences. These concessions range from a cut-off date for legalizing recent undocumented immigrants to an extended debate in the Judiciary Committee. Rubio has also secured a fix for a stronger system for tracking visa holders after initially expressing disappointment when the committee rejected a stronger system.\n\nRubio is actively engaging with potential allies, reaching out to senators such as Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio, as well as border state senators and undecided Democrats to gauge their demands for the bill. He is also consulting with border security officials outside the administration and House members focused on border issues, according to Rubio's office.\n\nRubio is also invoking the IRS scandal to sell his proposal, suggesting that a lack of trust in the government's ability to handle such matters necessitates congressional oversight. The specific parameters of Rubio's proposal are yet to be determined.",
    " Title: Report Finds U.S. Job Recovery Post-Great Recession Marked by Lower Wages and Increased Income Inequality\n\nArticle:\n\nA report commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Mayors has revealed that the United States has regained all the jobs lost during the Great Recession, which began at the end of 2007. However, the report, prepared by the firm IHS, shows that the annual wage in sectors where jobs were lost was $61,637, while the annual wage in sectors where jobs were restored is only $47,171 - a net loss estimated at $93 billion and representing a \"wage gap\" of 23 percent.\n\nThe jobs being created in the American economy are under scrutiny, with concerns being raised about their ability to support families and households. The report undercuts the importance of claims made by President Obama during a recent White House news conference, where he stated that the U.S. has added more jobs than any year since 2006 and is experiencing a six-month streak with at least 200,000 new jobs each month.\n\nEconomist Pamela Villareal of the National Center for Policy Analysis stated, \"When you look at the sectors of the economy that have grown since, say, 2011, a lot of the growth has occurred in retail, food service, hospitality. These are sectors that typically pay lower wages.\" She suggested that more growth in high-paying high-tech jobs could be achieved by reducing some of the regulations and taxes that are discouraging job growth in the United States.\n\nAnother finding of the IHS report is that income inequality, defined as the unequal distribution of income across the various participants in the economy, has grown during the recovery from the Great Recession. IHS economist Jim Diffley noted that the trend of the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer extends back decades. The top 20 percent of income-earning households in 1975 took home 43.6 percent of all income earned in the United States, the study finds, while that same top quintile of households now takes home 51 percent of all income.\n\nDiffley stated, \"There's no particular policies of this administration that drove that change that we can identify.\" He added, \"It tells you about the structure of the economy as it's evolved over time, over a much longer time than, than Barack Obama has been president.\" Diffley also noted that presidents and governors often receive too much credit when the economy is good and too much blame when the economy is bad.",
    " Title: Judge Rules Paul Manafort Breached Plea Deal, Lied to Investigators\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a ruling on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson determined that Paul Manafort, former campaign chief for President Donald Trump, breached his plea deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller by lying to prosecutors, the FBI, and a grand jury.\n\nManafort, who had pleaded guilty to some charges and avoided a separate trial in August for financial fraud related to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine, was found to have made multiple false statements about three different topics, including his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant who is believed to have ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nHowever, the judge cleared Manafort, 69, of allegations that he lied on two other subjects. The verdict could potentially lead to harsher sentences or the re-filing of charges against him.\n\nLast year, Mueller stated that Manafort lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" after signing the plea deal. In August, Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later, he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the U.S. and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mueller.\n\nThe plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prison and would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts. However, deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed.\n\nThe charges against Manafort primarily related to his political consulting work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely predating his role with the Trump campaign. Manafort worked for the Trump presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Trump clinched the Republican party nomination.\n\nPresident Trump has consistently branded the Mueller investigation a \"witch hunt\" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia. Manafort was charged by Mueller last October and during the trial, he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle, stating it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud.",
    " Title: President Obama Outlines Steps to Address VA Scandal, Stops Short of Firing Secretary Shinseki\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in a public address on Wednesday, outlined steps to address the ongoing Veterans Affairs (VA) scandal, while refraining from calling for the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki. Obama described Shinseki as a \"great soldier\" who has \"put his heart and soul into this thing.\"\n\nThe president has dispatched White House deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, to oversee a broader review, with Nabors currently in Phoenix, where allegations of patient deaths tied to delayed care first surfaced. Obama acknowledged the need for improvement, stating, \"We've got to do better.\"\n\nHowever, the president indicated he would wait for the conclusion of internal investigations before determining whether more top officials should resign. Obama emphasized, \"If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful and I will not tolerate it -- period.\"\n\nLeading Republicans swiftly criticized Obama's remarks, with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell stating, \"it's time for serious action and accountability.\" Sen. John McCain, a veteran and former prisoner of war, called Obama's statements \"wholly insufficient in addressing the fundamental, systemic problems plaguing our veterans' health care system.\"\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General's Office is currently investigating 26 facilities nationwide over allegations of manipulated waiting times and other issues. The House of Representatives has approved a bill that would give the VA secretary greater authority to fire or demote senior executives.\n\nRep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, accused the VA of a \"well-documented reluctance to ensure its leaders are held accountable for mistakes.\" The controversy erupted in Phoenix last month, with allegations of delayed care that may have led to patient deaths and a cover-up by top administrators.\n\nTwo Republican senators have introduced legislation to prohibit payment of bonuses to employees at the Veterans Health Administration through next year. The House passed a bill in February that would eliminate performance bonuses for the department's senior executive staff through 2018.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, has called on Obama to reconsider his plan to nominate Jeffrey Murawsky to replace the VA's undersecretary for health care, Robert Petzel, who has stepped down. The White House has stated that Obama remains confident in Shinseki's leadership and is standing behind Murawsky's nomination.",
    " Title: Chief Justice John Roberts' Conservative Voting Record Raises Concerns for Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming term of the Supreme Court, commencing on Monday, is anticipated to be significant, with cases concerning gun control, abortion, L.G.B.T. rights, and immigration on the docket. The term may indicate the extent to which the court's conservative majority will obstruct the agenda of the next Democratic president and Congress.\n\nThe Supreme Court is reportedly on the brink of a conservative shift, leading to concerns among Democrats. While Chief Justice John Roberts has expressed respect for precedent and concern for the court's legitimacy, historical data suggests that Democrats have reason to be apprehensive. The chief justice is not typically a swing vote among the four liberal and four conservative justices, nor a moderate. Instead, he is expected to align consistently with the conservative justices.\n\nDuring his 2005 confirmation hearing, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized his \"respect for precedent, even-handedness, predictability, stability.\" However, his voting record, analyzed over the last 14 years, reveals a partisan tendency, particularly in cases that overturn precedent. In 21 such cases, he voted to overturn precedent in 17, or 81%, making him the second, after Justice Clarence Thomas, in terms of frequency in a precedent-overturning majority over the last 14 years. In 15 such cases with partisan implications, the chief justice voted for conservative outcomes 93% of the time.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by Take Back the Court, relies on the methodology used by the Supreme Court Database, maintained by the law school at Washington University in St. Louis. To determine whether an outcome was liberal or conservative, the organization assumed that if at least four liberal justices voted for a decision in a split ruling, then the outcome was consistent with Democratic Party values and goals. Conversely, if at least four conservative justices voted similarly, the outcome was considered consistent with Republican Party values and goals.\n\nThe chief justice's voting record, according to this analysis, is as conservative as those of his most extreme current and former colleagues\u2014Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, and Antonin Scalia. In all 42 split-decision cases that the chief justice has presided over involving racial minorities, immigrants, workers, and abortion, he voted for conservative outcomes 100% of the time.",
    " Title: California and Oregon Automatically Register Voters, Breaking Barriers in U.S. Voting History\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill on Saturday that will initiate the automatic registration of adult citizens to vote. Starting in 2016, every adult citizen in the state who obtains a driver's license, renews a license, gets a state identification card, or fills out a change of address form with the Department of Motor Vehicles will be registered to vote, unless they decline. Oregon became the first state in the country to implement such a law earlier this year, making California the second.\n\nHistorically, governments in the United States have often erected barriers to prevent people from voting, such as property ownership requirements, poll taxes, or literacy tests. However, many of these barriers have fallen over time, making it easier for people to register. Nevertheless, many states, including California, still close off registration weeks to a month before an election, an artificial obstacle that can prevent eligible voters from participating if they miss the deadline.\n\nThese new proposals remove those obstacles. Oregon's law will register all adult citizens in the DMV's database, while California's law will be implemented more gradually, as people get or renew their licenses or state IDs, or change their addresses. Both make it the government's responsibility to ensure that all eligible voters are registered.\n\nThe concept of automatically registering voters is novel in the U.S. Support and opposition have been breaking down along party lines, with Democrats generally in favor and Republicans opposed, although they have not argued against the principle of easing registration. Critics have raised concerns about potential privacy issues and voter fraud, but supporters argue that people can always opt out, and the registered voters' data is more publicly accessible than DMV information.\n\nIn terms of voter fraud, critics have expressed concerns about the potential registration of unauthorized immigrants. However, California began issuing driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year, but these licenses are distinctively marked, and people with them would not be registered to vote automatically. Oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver's license applicants.\n\nNational Democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause. In a speech on voting rights this June, Hillary Clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. Legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to Oregon's new law, and the Brennan Center is tracking them.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Proposes $20 Trillion Medicare for All Plan, Faces Criticism from Rivals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed a $20 trillion federal spending plan over the next decade to provide universal healthcare to all Americans without raising taxes on the middle class. The proposal, titled \"Medicare for All,\" aims to address criticism of her previous lack of clarity on how she would fund her sweeping healthcare plan.\n\nThe details of Warren's plan involve requiring employers to transfer to the government almost all the $8.8 trillion she estimates they would otherwise spend on private insurance for employees. This transfer, according to Warren, would generate nearly half of the required funds to cover the cost of Medicare for All, along with existing taxes.\n\nEmployers with fewer than 50 employees that do not already sponsor coverage are exempt from the proposal. In a concession to unions, Warren's plan allows employers offering health benefits under collective bargaining agreements to reduce their contributions to federal coffers, provided they pass the savings on to employees.\n\nWarren's proposal has faced criticism from moderate rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who has labeled it as \"mathematical gymnastics.\" Some independent experts have also questioned the realism of Warren's numbers.\n\nThe politics surrounding government-funded healthcare have resurfaced after Warren released her proposal. Biden, who favors building on the Affordable Care Act, has criticized Warren's plan as eliminating private insurance coverage and as a tax increase on workers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has branded Medicare for All as socialism. Warren's chief architect of Medicare for All, Senator Bernie Sanders, has previously released several options to pay for it, including a 4% income tax \"premium\" that kicks in after the first $29,000 for a family of four, affecting the middle class.\n\nIndependent experts have raised doubts about the Warren campaign's estimates. John Holahan, an economist at the Urban Institute, stated, \"They are making more aggressive assumptions about the same things we already made aggressive assumptions about.\"\n\nPassing such legislation through Congress poses a significant challenge, as a Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to approve anything approaching Medicare for All. If Democrats take the Senate majority, the party may not have enough votes to break a filibuster.\n\nA critical question for Warren is whether her $20 trillion cost estimate is accurate. The Urban Institute think tank recently pegged the cost closer to $34 trillion over 10 years. If Warren is underestimating the cost by that much, her predictions about needed tax revenue would come up well short.\n\nThe practical application of Warren's proposed employer contribution will be closely scrutinized, as it could create winners and losers among companies depending on their health care costs, which can reflect such factors as the age of the workforce and the generosity of benefits.\n\nOver the weekend, Warren and more than a dozen other candidates will be in Iowa, which holds the nation's leadoff presidential caucuses in three months. Healthcare remains a dominant issue as the first votes of the Democratic contest near.",
    " Title: Schumer Proposes Open Primaries to Counteract Tea Party Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has suggested that the Democratic Party should push for more open primaries as a means to counteract the Tea Party movement. In a speech at the Center for American Progress on Thursday, Schumer outlined a plan to implement a nonpartisan \"blanket\" primary system, where all candidates compete and the top finishers advance regardless of party affiliation.\n\nSchumer argued that this system would force right-wing candidates to appeal to centrist voters, thereby pushing out the most extreme candidates. He suggested adopting a system similar to that in California, Louisiana, and Washington state, where all voters, regardless of party, can vote, and the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, then enter a runoff.\n\nSchumer contends that the Tea Party movement is being influenced by a few wealthy donors whose limited-government philosophy does not reflect the ideas of millions of voters who identify as Tea Party supporters but who benefit from government programs such as Social Security or public education.\n\nSchumer proposed that Democrats should go on the offensive by portraying the government as a \"force for good,\" focusing on issues such as raising the minimum wage, making college more affordable, and building bridges, roads, and broadband infrastructure.\n\nSal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, predicted that this strategy would not resonate with Tea Party supporters. \"The tea party is not going to be assuaged by suggesting that even a bigger and more expensive federal government is the answer,\" Russo said.\n\nThe Tea Party movement emerged in 2009 in response to public anger over the government bailout of private banks and President Obama's early moves to boost government spending. Insurgent candidates, fueled by Tea Party enthusiasm, unseated longtime Republicans in primaries in 2010 and helped Republicans win control of the House and gain seats in the Senate. However, several Tea Party Senate candidates lost races that analysts had said could have been won by more mainstream candidates.\n\nSchumer's hour-long speech indicates that Democrats are starting to view Tea Party lawmakers as significant competition, according to Dan Holler, communications director for the conservative activist group Heritage Action for America. \"I think what Sen. Schumer is trying to accomplish is to divide the tea party,\" Holler said. \"It speaks to the success the movement has had not only in terms of moving the Republican Party to a vision of smaller government but changing how Washington operates.\"\n\nSchumer also expressed concern about signs of xenophobia or cultural fear among Tea Party supporters and suggested that the Tea Party's limited-government message is a reaction to the country's shift to a more urban economy, comparing it to Prohibition in the 1920s.",
    " Title: U.S. PPE Aid Delivery to Foreign Countries Paused Amid Global Shortage\n\nArticle:\n\nThe delivery of coronavirus-related Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) aid to at least 13 countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Honduras, and the Philippines, has been put on hold due to a review process, according to an administration official. The delay in aid delivery has raised concerns about potential damage to relationships with allies who could be crucial in supplying critical supplies in the future.\n\nThe U.S. task force is reportedly discussing the potential role of foreign aid in assisting the U.S. during a potential second wave of the virus. Vice President Mike Pence is said to recognize the importance of waiting for the right time to provide assistance while acknowledging the benefits of foreign assistance.\n\nAmerican diplomats are also grappling with China's attempts to exploit the shortages by supplying aid to Western countries. The U.S. has been providing aid to various countries, including Myanmar, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, and others, in the form of protective gear.\n\nThere is bipartisan agreement on the need to resupply American hospitals and address domestic shortages. However, the slow and insufficient international aid is causing concern, as it may contribute to the continued spread of the virus in vulnerable communities.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) expressed his concern, stating, \"Our domestic response needs to be the priority, but the amount of aid offered internationally has been too slow and too small, risking the continued spread of the virus to Americans and to communities in countries with weaker infrastructure, immense poverty, and ongoing humanitarian crises.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has not actively discouraged U.S. companies from exporting PPE overseas, but FEMA is reportedly asking USAID to send back most of the reserves of protective gear it has stored in warehouses in Dubai and Miami for use in the U.S. The U.S. government emphasizes that it is not providing countries with hard-to-find equipment that could be used to fight coronavirus in the United States instead.\n\nA senior State Department official stated, \"When it comes to PPE in particular, right now our assistance is not a zero-sum game. We are not providing assistance that could be headed to Detroit or to Kansas City. That's not what we're doing.\" The official added that the hold on aid delivery is not intended to be permanent and will be lifted when industries are able to ramp up production and the U.S. has enough capacity to supply both domestic and international needs.",
    " Title: U.S. Healthcare System Capable of Preventing Ebola Outbreak, Says Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is working to alleviate concerns about Ebola in the United States, stating that despite some initial missteps, the healthcare system is taking the necessary measures to prevent an outbreak. Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health, asserted that the U.S. healthcare infrastructure is well-equipped to stop Ebola.\n\nOn Friday, a high-level briefing at the White House underscored the administration's efforts to reassure the public. Five senior administration officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's top homeland security adviser, and Dr. Fauci, addressed reporters.\n\nMonaco stated that the U.S. is not considering a travel ban to prevent individuals from the hardest-hit West African countries from entering the U.S. Instead, efforts are focused on identifying high-risk individuals before they leave the outbreak zone. According to Monaco, dozens of people have been stopped from boarding flights in the region.\n\n\"The most effective way to go about controlling this is to prevent those individuals from getting on a plane in the first place,\" Monaco said.\n\nThe first case of Ebola in the U.S. was diagnosed last week, with the patient being sent home from a Dallas hospital despite revealing a visit from Liberia. Texas officials are now monitoring 50 people, 10 of whom are considered at high risk, who came into contact with the patient. Four of them have been quarantined, and there have been issues with disposing of the infectious waste left in the patient's apartment.\n\n\"There were things that did not go the way they should have in Dallas,\" acknowledged Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"But there were a lot of things that went right and are going right.\"\n\nHealth officials have stated that someone who had close contact with the patient after they became ill\u2014the only time Ebola is contagious\u2014might also contract the disease. However, they believe further spread is unlikely due to the public health steps currently in place.\n\n\"We respect your concern. We understand your concern. But the evidence base tells us that that is not going to happen,\" Fauci said.\n\nThe White House announced that Obama will meet with his national security advisers on Monday to discuss the Ebola outbreak and the administration's response.\n\nThe administration has long maintained that the best way to contain Ebola is to address it at its source. The Pentagon's spokesman stated that up to 4,000 troops could be deployed to West Africa, a number that has gradually increased as military leaders assess the need.\n\nNavy Rear Adm. John Kirby said the military has begun medical testing for Ebola at two new labs in Liberia. Service members are also constructing two treatment centers for Ebola victims and a hospital for infected medical personnel, with the latter expected to be completed by the end of October.\n\nKirby stated that the service members will not treat patients or come into contact with infected individuals. However, they are being trained on how to avoid contracting Ebola and have plans in place to deal with any service member who might become infected.\n\n\"We're going to train them up on what Ebola looks like, feels like, does. While they're there, they're going to be constantly monitored on a regular, frequent basis,\" Kirby said. \"There will be a screening process to make sure that once they're no longer there, that we're able to stay in touch with them, make sure that they have not... felt or experienced any symptoms.\"\n\nHe added that troops will have personal protection equipment if needed and will be trained in how to use it. He stated that he is unaware of any special staffing or other changes at military hospitals in the U.S. to prepare them for caring for Ebola patients.\n\nCurrently, about 230 U.S. troops are deployed for the Ebola mission. Approximately two dozen are in Senegal setting up a transportation center, with the rest in Liberia. The Army announced on Friday that up to 3,200 soldiers from various units around the country will be going to Liberia, including 1,800 from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, who will arrive late this month. Other troops from Fort Hood and Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are also being deployed, along with support units from Fort Benning and Fort Stewart, Georgia, and Fort Eustis, Virginia.",
    " Title: Clinton to Announce Vice Presidential Pick on Friday, Tim Kaine Emerges as Leading Contender\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton is set to reveal her vice presidential running mate on Friday, according to people close to the search process. The Democratic presidential nominee is planning to make her first public appearance with her running mate at a campaign rally in Miami on Saturday at Florida International University.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as a leading contender, receiving support from President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. Clinton's choice of Kaine would be a strategic move, as Florida is a crucial battleground state, and Kaine speaks fluent Spanish, appealing to the state's large Hispanic population.\n\nClinton has been tight-lipped about her vice presidential pick, fearful of leaks before a well-orchestrated weekend rollout. Her campaign has offered supporters the chance to be the \"first to know\" her vice presidential pick, similar to Barack Obama's strategy in 2008.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who would be the first Hispanic and African-American vice presidential candidates, respectively, were also considered. However, their limited experience in national security and government made them less likely to be selected, according to Democrats close to the process.\n\nThe selection of a running mate opens a new chapter in Clinton's political life, as she chooses her own partner for the first time in her presidential campaign. Clinton was deeply involved in the selection of Al Gore as her husband's running mate in 1992, but this choice is hers alone.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been closely watching the Republican convention, particularly Donald Trump's speech, but has decided against making an announcement early Friday morning. The Democratic ticket's debut is designed to build anticipation for the party's convention starting Monday in Philadelphia. After their formal nomination, Clinton and her new running mate are expected to embark on a bus tour to key campaign battlegrounds.\n\nClinton has intentionally not informed anyone who has gone through the vetting process of her final decision, in hopes of keeping her choice a secret until the last possible moment. The selection of either Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, or Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey would influence the balance of power in the Senate, as their replacement would be named, at least initially, by a Republican governor in their state.",

She died on Saturday in a New York hospital after being in a coma following a massive heart attack.\n\nGarner became an activist following her father's death in 2014 on Staten Island, New York, during a police arrest. Eric Garner died as a result of a police chokehold while being arrested on suspicion of selling single cigarettes without tax stamps.\n\nHer last words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for activists. A grand jury declined to indict the officer involved in the incident, and the city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement.\n\nErica Garner had been in a coma since suffering cardiac arrest on Christmas Eve. Her mother, Esaw Snipes-Garner, reported that her daughter suffered her first heart attack not long after giving birth in August.\n\nIn a statement on her official Twitter account, her family and friends wrote, \"Her heart was bigger than the world. It really really was. She cared when most people would not have. She was good. She only pursued right, no matter what. No one gave her justice.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, the activist endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president in the Democratic primaries and appeared in a campaign ad on his behalf. She also criticized New York City's Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio over policing matters.\n\nShortly after Erica was hospitalized, Sen. Sanders issued a statement on Twitter regarding her activism: \"My thoughts are with Erica Garner. I have had the privilege of joining with her at a number of events and was deeply impressed with her courage and insights.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Fourth of July Speech Contains False Claims About Coronavirus and Administration's Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his Fourth of July speech, President Donald Trump reflected on the nation's history and its accomplishments, but also made several false claims about the coronavirus and his administration's response to the pandemic.\n\nTrump claimed, \"We've learned how to put out the flame\" of coronavirus, implying that the US has effectively controlled the virus. However, this statement is misleading as the country has experienced its highest daily rate of cases over the past week. In the days leading up to Trump's remarks, the US set a new global record for the most number of coronavirus cases recorded in a day.\n\nThe President's claim that the US response to the pandemic is \"moving along well\" is disingenuous, as the country's response is not \"moving along well\" when compared with other countries. While coronavirus cases remain high in the US, other countries in Europe and across the world have seen clear downward trends in the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases. The European Union has also banned US residents from traveling there given the sudden spike in coronavirus cases in the US.\n\nTrump also falsely suggested that the recent rise in US coronavirus cases is due to increased testing, and claimed that a majority of the cases that test positive for coronavirus are \"totally harmless.\" However, experts say the recent surges in coronavirus cases are outpacing the increase in tests. Out of the at least 2.8 million cases of coronavirus in the US, Johns Hopkins estimated a fatality rate of 4.6% as of Saturday.\n\nThe commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration declined to defend the President and repeatedly refused to say whether Trump's remark is true or false. The White House has not returned CNN's request for comment on the President's claim.\n\nTrump also touted efforts led by his administration to manufacture the equipment needed to fight the outbreak, claiming, \"We've made ventilators where there were none.\" However, it's not true that the Trump administration was left no ventilators by the Obama administration, something Trump has falsely claimed on numerous occasions. In March, there were 16,660 ventilators available in the national stockpile for immediate use, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTrump also stated, \"We are unleashing our nation's scientific brilliance. And we'll likely have a therapeutic and/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year.\" However, Trump's timeline is more optimistic than both experts' and his own previous predictions. Last week, some top health officials said the US could be on track to have a vaccine by the end of the year, but not \"long before.\" While several vaccine candidates have shown positive early data, all of them still have to undergo more trials.",
    " Title: Health Care Debate in Upstate New York Swing District to Reflect National Trends\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the closely contested 24th Congressional District of New York, a rematch between former Democratic Representative Dan Maffei and incumbent Republican Ann Marie Buerkle is expected to revolve around the Supreme Court's recent ruling on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \"Obamacare.\"\n\nMaffei, who lost to Buerkle in 2010 due to his support for the ACA, is advocating for a shift in focus from past debates to economic improvement. Buerkle, who won by a narrow margin in 2010, remains committed to repealing the ACA.\n\nMaffei stated, \"I don't think people want to repeat past battles over and over again. The health care bill is the law of the land, the court ruled it constitutional, so let's improve it.\" He emphasized the need to focus on jobs and the economy, rather than revisiting the contentious health care debate of 2009.\n\nBuerkle, who is known for her conservative stance, has been tapped by Republican leadership to speak out on the ACA. She has been vocal on the issue, addressing the press with Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor following the Supreme Court's ruling, and delivering the national Republican address on the topic over the weekend.\n\nBuerkle links the repeal of the ACA to the economic recovery the district needs. For instance, she cites a local medical device factory that could be subject to a 2.3 percent tax should the ACA be fully implemented.\n\nThe health care debate in this district could serve as a national barometer for how the issue plays out in swing districts and among independent voters across the country. The region, still grappling with the effects of the recession and loss of manufacturing jobs, is particularly sensitive to economic improvement.\n\nRetired Fair Haven resident Harris Brown, who plans to vote for Buerkle but desires less partisanship in Washington, expressed a desire for economic growth to improve health care. \"If the economy is good, then health care will take care of itself,\" Brown said.\n\nThe health care debate in this district is likely to reflect broader trends in the upcoming elections, with Democrats arguing that the Supreme Court has spoken on the ACA and focusing on economic improvement, while Republicans argue that the ACA infringes on individual freedoms and is a burdensome regulatory measure.",
    " Title: Trump and Omar Exchange Harsh Rhetoric: President Calls Omar \"America-Hating\" and \"Anti-Semite,\" Omar Responds with Allegations of Racism\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) have engaged in a heated exchange of rhetoric this week, with the President labeling Omar as \"America-hating\" and an \"Anti-Semite\" in a series of tweets. Omar responded by accusing the President of racism.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump tweeted, \"I think it's clear that President Trump wants to make a foil out of 'the squad,'\" referring to Omar and her fellow liberal freshman representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Trump's tweet followed a previous post in which he called the group a \"Nightmare for America.\"\n\nCBS News Political Director Caitlin Conant noted during her appearance on \"Faith Nation\" that Trump has used the group's perceived anti-American views to his advantage in the 2020 election. However, Conant also pointed out that in 2016, Trump won in part due to independents who might prefer to discuss issues such as the economy and the courts rather than the ongoing Twitter feud between the President and \"the squad.\"\n\nConservative groups have seized upon comments made by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) a few months ago, in which she stated, \"I'm more Palestinian in the halls of Congress than I am in the country.\" This statement has been used to question the loyalty of the \"squad\" members.\n\nIn a 2018 interview, Omar made controversial comments about Islamophobia and terrorism. When asked about the rise in Islamophobia, Omar stated, \"Our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within this country.\" She also suggested profiling and monitoring white men to combat radicalization.\n\nOmar is also the subject of an ethics complaint filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch over allegations of potential immigration fraud, marriage fraud, and perjury related to her marriage to her brother.\n\nThe ongoing feud between Trump and Omar has been met with criticism from both sides, with some viewing it as a toxic and divisive distraction from more pressing issues. However, the President's approval rating remains higher than any of the \"squad\" members, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) having the highest approval rating at 23%.",
    " Title: Retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn Killed During Riots, No Arrests Made in Case\n\nRetired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn was fatally shot while attempting to protect a friend's pawn shop during violent riots that erupted across the U.S. in response to the death of George Floyd. The incident occurred on Monday night, and Dorn's body was found outside Lee's Pawn & Jewelry around 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday. The Associated Press reported that no arrests have been made in the case so far.\n\nDorn, 77, was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and regularly assisted him whenever the store's alarms were triggered. His wife, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Dispatch that Dorn was dedicated to helping disadvantaged youth during his time on the force.\n\nDorn retired from the St. Louis police force in October 2007 after serving 38 years. His close friend, St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch, who knew Dorn for 30 years, told the media that Dorn and his wife helped disadvantaged youth while he was on the force.\n\nPresident Donald Trump honored Dorn in a tweet after his death was reported. \"Our highest respect to the family of David Dorn, a Great Police Captain from St. Louis, who was viciously shot and killed by despicable looters last night. We honor our police officers, perhaps more than ever before. Thank you!\" Trump tweeted, along with a photo of Dorn in uniform.\n\nDorn's death is one of many police officers who have been killed or attacked during the riots. Four officers in Missouri were shot while trying to contain rioters. A police officer in Las Vegas was in \"grave condition\" and on life support after being shot. An officer was also shot in Iowa after an ambush. Two officers in Richmond, Virginia, were shot after responding to a report of an armed person, though it is still unclear if the person was involved with the riots.\n\nIn Buffalo, New York, two officers were injured after an SUV ran into a line of police trying to maintain the peace.

    " Title: Carly Fiorina's Business Experience and Political Stance Under Scrutiny in GOP Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and the sole female candidate in the Republican presidential race, has a compelling life story and a unique position in the political landscape. Born in Austin, Texas, Fiorina became the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company, shattering one of the hardest glass ceilings in America. As the Republican primary race heats up, attention is being paid not just to Fiorina's bid for the nomination, but also to her potential as a running mate for the eventual male nominee.\n\nFiorina's main claim to the national stage, by her own admission, is her business experience and acumen. \"I think [voters] very much appreciate someone who understands how the economy works, how the world works, and how big bureaucracies work,\" she told Breitbart News while pre-campaigning in New Hampshire ahead of her Monday announcement.\n\nHowever, Fiorina's tenure as CEO of Hewlett-Packard, which ended ten years ago, has been a subject of debate. Critics argue that she left the company in worse shape than she found it before her dismissal in 2005, but Fiorina often points to her chief achievement, the $25 billion takeover of Compaq in 2001, as evidence of her success.\n\nA more significant potential issue for Fiorina is her stance on economic and social issues compared to her corporate peers. While Fiorina's views align with the GOP on critical primary issues such as minimum wage increases, immigration reform, and same-sex marriage, she is increasingly out-of-step with her corporate brethren.\n\nThe most recent evidence of this disconnect was the furor over religious freedom laws in Indiana, Arkansas, and other states. These laws, as originally drafted, might have allowed businesses in those states to discriminate against same-sex couples. The corporate backlash was swift and severe, with companies such as Eli Lilly, Cummins, Gap, Marriott, and Walmart speaking out against the laws.\n\nUntil the religious-freedom controversy erupted, Fiorina had tried to take a more nuanced view than her GOP rivals, backing government benefits for same-sex civil unions while stopping short of endorsing same-sex marriage. However, the Indiana controversy forced her into open conflict with her former business colleagues, whom she harshly criticized while defending the Indiana law.\n\nMarriage equality is just one example of corporate America's growing independence from the Republican platform. Since an increase-the-minimum-wage movement began in Seattle a year ago, a slew of Fortune 500 CEOs, including McDonald's, Walmart, and Starbucks, have come out in favor of minimum-wage increases, a position that Fiorina and most GOP candidates oppose. CEOs are also beginning to call for immigration reform and to criticize congressional efforts to block it, as well as to blame opposition by Republican party leaders for the 2013 government shutdown crisis.\n\nLong-time denizens of the corporate boardroom say that changing social mores as well as a changing economy have begun to alter mindsets at major companies, especially on minimum wage increases. \"I think there is a gradual shift going on,\" says Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant Pimco and one of the country's most-followed observers of corporate trends. Since Fiorina left the corporate world, he says, \"We've come through a period in which the share of profit in GDP is the highest ever and continuously increasing, and in which income inequality has worsened tremendously. Business is realizing there is a limit to which you can push corporate profits without starting to hurt yourself.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Adult Obesity Rates Remain Steady Despite Health Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has seen a plateau in adult obesity rates for the first time in 30 years, according to recent data. However, this development is not cause for celebration, as the current rates remain high and pose significant health concerns. The headline \"U.S. adult obesity rates holding steady, but still bad\" encapsulates the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe root cause of the obesity epidemic is a topic of ongoing debate among scientists. One key factor under scrutiny is the role of sugar and sugary drinks. A correlation, rather than a causation, exists between sugar consumption and the rise of obesity and diabetes in the U.S.\n\nRecent findings and disagreements regarding this correlation have been discussed by science writer David Despain. It is prudent for individuals concerned with health to limit their consumption of sugary items, but an alarmist \"sugar is toxic\" narrative is not supported by good science communication or public health.\n\nPediatric endocrinologist Robert Lustig is a prominent proponent of this perspective. Lustig argues that metabolic disease, a suite of ailments including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and dementia, is primarily caused by sugar. He claims that fructose, a component of sugar, is the main culprit, metabolizing to fat and driving metabolic syndrome.\n\nHowever, Lustig's assertions are contested by other scientists. Mark Kern, Professor of Exercise and Nutritional Sciences at San Diego State University, has pointed out that many of Lustig's arguments are not scientifically supported, including his demonization of fructose. According to Kern, Lustic's claims about fructose metabolizing to fat are not accurate.\n\nDavid Despain has also criticized Lustig's \"demonizing\" of sugar and the media's tendency to embrace this perspective. It is crucial to approach discussions about sugar and health with a balanced perspective, avoiding sensationalized claims that may not be grounded in scientific evidence.",
    " Title: Global Elections to Watch in 2015: Kentucky Governor Race, Nigerian Presidential Election, and More\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2015, political enthusiasts in the United States can look forward to a series of significant elections across the globe, serving as a prelude to the 2016 presidential race. Among these are high-profile gubernatorial and mayoral races in the U.S., as well as pivotal national elections abroad.\n\nIn Kentucky, the state with a Republican lean in the last four presidential elections and two conservative senators, the race for governor is heating up. Current Democratic Governor Steve Beshear, who was reelected in 2011 but is term-limited, has left the political stage, with his Lieutenant Governor, Crit Luallen, also opting not to run. The only major Democratic candidate to announce so far is Attorney General Jack Conway, who lost to Rand Paul in the 2010 Senate contest by 10 points. There is hope among Democrats that Allison Lundergan Grimes, who lost to Mitch McConnell in the 2014 Senate race, will enter the fray. On the Republican side, Louisville Metro Councilman Hal Heiner and State Agricultural Commissioner James Comer have both declared their candidacy. The November Kentucky race will be a key indicator of the Democrats' ability to maintain their support in traditionally red states following the midterm elections.\n\nIn Nigeria, President Goodluck Jonathan is seeking reelection in February. The contest is expected to be dominated by the violence many anticipate from the radical Islamist group Boko Haram, which is capable of perpetrating acts such as the kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok last April. Jonathan will face a rematch against former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari, who represents the All Progressives Congress, a coalition formed in 2013 that has since banked numerous defections from Jonathan's People's Democratic Party. Jonathan aims to secure support from the country's Christian south, as he has enraged many Muslims in his party by reneging on a gentleman's agreement that the PDP's top spot would rotate on a two-term basis between a Muslim and a Christian.\n\nAnother election to watch is Saudi Arabia's municipal elections, marking the first time women can both vote and run for office. Although only half of the councils' seats are elected and the councils themselves have limited power, these elections are significant as they represent the first time women can participate in the political process.\n\nSpain's 2015 general election will feature the country's two dominant parties, the right-wing People's Party (PP) and the left-wing Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), both waning in popularity. Current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is leading the PP, but his administration's approval ratings have suffered due to unpopular austerity measures, accusations of corruption, and economic malaise. The country witnessed the emergence of Podemos, a left-wing populist party, during the 2014 European Parliamentary election, which gained 8 percent of the national vote. Podemos aims to rewrite the constitution, oust corrupt leaders, raise taxes for more public services, and shorten the work week to reduce unemployment.\n\nIn Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel is fighting for his political life in his reelection bid. With the leader of the Chicago Teachers Union, Karen Lewis, announcing she would not challenge him due to illness, Emanuel's path to victory is smoother. However, he could still face challenges in the city's runoff system, which might unite a fractured opposition should he fail to gain 50 percent of the vote in the first round. Anti-Rahm sentiment remains high, with an August Chicago Tribune poll finding that Emanuel's approval rating is only 35 percent. However, a recent poll from David Binder Research shows that his main opponents, Ald. Robert Fioretti and Cook County Commissioner Jes\u00fas G. \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda, have yet to gain significant support.",
    " Title: House Approves Two-Year, $2.7 Trillion Budget Deal, Increasing Federal Spending and National Debt\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has approved a two-year, $2.7 trillion budget deal that increases federal spending by about $320 billion annually and is estimated to add approximately $1.7 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. The budget deal, which was hammered out over the past week between Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, shatters budget caps and exceeds the spending baseline set by the 2011 bill that imposed the so-called \"sequestration.\"\n\nThe budget deal, which passed with a vote of 284-149, was supported by all but 16 House Democrats. President Donald Trump, who had previously stated he would \"never sign another bill\" that increased the deficit, has been supportive of the new agreement. He met with Republican lawmakers for a lunch on Thursday, urging affirmative votes.\n\nSixty-five Republicans in the House supported the deal, while 132 voted against it. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a former Republican who is now the lone independent in the House, voted \"nay.\"\n\nA majority of Republicans voting against a budget deal inked by a Republican president might seem noteworthy, but today's GOP lawmakers only vote for fiscal conservatism when it does not matter. When it did matter, they were more than happy to add to the deficit. In 2016, when Trump was elected and Republicans gained control of all aspects of the federal government's budget-making authority, the United States was carrying about $19 trillion in debt. Today, in part due to the 2018 budget bill the Republican-controlled Congress passed and Trump signed, the national debt has surpassed $22 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that current policies, which do not include the hike in spending approved by the House on Thursday, will add another $11 trillion by the end of 2029.\n\nIf the budget deal eventually makes it to Trump's desk and receives his signature, the 45th president will have personally added $4.1 trillion to the national debt in a little over two years in office, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for balanced budgets. The Senate is planning to vote on the bill next week.\n\nOne of the final speakers before the House vote was Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. He reflected on the fact that lawmakers would soon be leaving Washington for a few weeks of work in district offices\u2014for Womack, that means having some town hall meetings with constituents.\n\n\"I already know most people are going to say 'look, you guys have a spending problem up there in Washington,'\" Womack said.",
    " Title: CNN Faces Ratings Struggles as Fox News Dominates Cable News Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the competitive landscape of cable news, CNN has faced significant challenges in the first quarter of 2021, with none of its programs cracking the top 20 in the rating chart. Fox News continues to lead, while even MSNBC, often criticized for its anti-Trump stance, managed to break into the top 20 on multiple fronts.\n\nAccording to data from Breitbart, Fox News placed eight shows in the top ten and 14 in the top 20. MSNBC filled the remaining slots. CNN's highest-rated program, \"The Lead\" hosted by Jake Tapper, ranked 22nd with 1.387 million viewers. Tapper's show may have performed well due to President Trump's daily briefings airing during his otherwise anemic timeslot. Sean Hannity, on Fox News, topped everyone during the quarter with an average of 4.22 million viewers, more than triple CNN's top show.\n\nIn fact, the only Fox program CNN was able to beat was \"Fox and Friends First,\" which airs before dawn and still managed to come in 40th with 721,000 average viewers. \"Fox and Friends First\" humiliated CNN's disastrous morning show, \"New Day,\" which was only able to attract 580,000 average viewers.\n\nOverall, Fox News had its biggest viewing quarter in the network's history, averaging 3.4 million primetime viewers and 1.9 million total-day viewers. CNN managed to average 1.43 million primetime viewers, with MSNBC coming in at 1.93 million. Fox News beat both combined during primetime. During primetime, CNN managed to lose to ESPN (1.43 million compared to 1.5 million), even though sports events have been largely canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThese ratings struggles are not a new phenomenon for CNN. If it weren't for CNN International, which is less Trump-critical, CNN might have to consider closure. While CNN's future is not immediately at risk, the president has additional ammunition to criticize the network's reporters at press conferences in the future.",
    " Title: Seattle Town Hall Discussion Highlights Factors Driving Polarization in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nA Seattle Town Hall forum, titled \"2016 Election: How Did We Get Here?\", hosted by the University of Washington Alumni Association, brought together scholars to discuss the current presidential campaign. The discussion, which focused on the Trump phenomenon and its impact on American politics, highlighted factors such as anger, ignorance, and isolation.\n\nThe forum, led by Christopher Sebastian Parker, a political science professor at the University of Washington, began with a discussion about the recent debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The panelists, including Rick Shenkman, a Seattle journalist, historian, and social-science author, and Mark A. Smith, a UW political scientist, agreed that debates do not typically change voters' support and expect a very close race.\n\nThe discussion focused primarily on the Trump phenomenon, with panelists offering insights into why Trump has emerged as a major-party nominee and is running strongly. One of the reasons, according to Shenkman, is that Trump, with his own money and oversized media attention, did not need party elites to support him. He spoke directly to voters who want an outsider who understands their feelings.\n\nShenkman's books, \"Just How Stupid Are We?\" and \"Political Animals: How Our Stone-Age Brain Gets in the Way of Smart Politics,\" provide insights into the science that shows our gut instincts usually outweigh rationality in political choices. Shenkman stated, \"Donald Trump came along, and he has now proven my point.\"\n\nMark A. Smith, a UW political scientist who has studied the role of religion in politics, provided an example of a choice that may not seem logical. He predicts that Mormons, uncomfortable with Trump due to their religious values, will still vote for Trump to maintain political consistency.\n\nThe panelists also discussed the role of isolation from opposing information in increasing political polarization. It is easier for people today to take in only information that confirms their beliefs. Margaret O' Mara, associate history professor at the UW, compared Trump to historical figures such as Huey Long, Father Coughlin, Joe McCarthy, and George Wallace.\n\nTrump's rise, according to O' Mara, is partly due to the two major parties' failure to address the frustration and anger that many people feel, some of it driven by economic anxiety. The panelists agreed that whoever wins, the anger will still be present, which is a problem. Shenkman stated, \"When you're angry, democracy fails because angry people do not compromise.\"\n\nThe discussion also touched on the role of race in politics today. Smith stated that the biggest dividing line in the campaign is around racial identity, with Trump's supporters being disproportionately white. O' Mara noted that the debate on Monday was the first time a presidential candidate in a debate said the word \"racism.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the panelists agreed that fighting anger, ignorance, and isolation is crucial for the future of American politics. They found hope in civil discourse and education, acknowledging that it won't be easy. At the start of the forum, Parker asked people in the audience who supported Trump to raise their hands. No hands went up.",
    " Title: White House Delays Release of Progress Report on ISIL Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House initially planned to release a progress report on the fight against the Islamic State (ISIL) in conjunction with President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday, but the report was delayed due to coordination issues. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed the delay on Friday.\n\nThe report, which was issued three days late, claims that the 65-nation coalition led by the U.S. has made significant progress in its campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL. The report states that the coalition has intensified the fight to liberate ISIL-controlled territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed President Obama's and the administration's commitment to eliminating the threat posed by ISIL. The report emphasizes the need for patience and flexibility in the multi-year fight against ISIL, acknowledging that there will be challenges along the way.\n\nThe report highlights several achievements, including the fact that 12 coalition countries have conducted over 9,500 air strikes in Iraq and Syria. These airstrikes have reportedly destroyed over 3,450 ISIL vehicles and tanks, over 1,120 artillery and mortar positions, 1,170 oil infrastructure components, and more than 13,500 fighting positions, checkpoints, buildings, bunkers, staging areas, and barracks in Iraq and Syria. The report also mentions the destruction of 39 ISIL training camps.\n\nThe report does not specify the 12 coalition countries that have conducted the majority of the air strikes, nor does it provide details on the specific locations of these strikes. The report also does not provide information on the number of casualties or the current status of the fight against ISIL.",
    " Title: GOP Holds Sizable Advantage in Midterm Elections, According to Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN poll indicates a significant advantage for the Republican Party in this year's midterm elections. The poll shows President Barack Obama's standing on terrorism issues in decline as voter concerns about ISIS rise.\n\nThe poll, released on Monday, also reveals that more Americans perceive the country as heading in the wrong direction, a common indicator of the electorate's mood. Recent days have also brought a series of polls in key Senate races suggesting Republican advantages in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Alaska, with only a narrow Democratic lead in Colorado. The odds of a GOP takeover of the Senate are looking up eight weeks before Election Day.\n\nVeteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres comments, \"It's much better to be a Republican candidate than a Democratic candidate, at least at the moment.\" He adds, \"Yes, the Republican brand sucks, but it is the President's image that dominates midterm elections, not that of our party.\"\n\nThe improving Senate climate for Republicans has rekindled discussions about a \"wave\" in the elections. The veteran prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote on Monday, \"I am now expecting a substantial Republican Senate wave in November, with a net gain of at least seven seats.\"\n\nHowever, Ayres cautions, \"I don't see any evidence of a wave like we had in '06 or '08.\" He adds, \"But a few more polls like the one you cite could get me to change my mind.\"\n\nIn the CNN poll numbers, the encouraging news for the President is that he and the public are largely in agreement about the appropriate response to ISIS. A majority opposes American combat boots on the ground, but 50% support using other military force, up from 34% a year ago.\n\nHowever, the damning finding is that 67% of respondents believe Obama does not have a clear plan for dealing with ISIS. Additionally, only 37% approve of how he is handling ISIS, and just 41% approve of his handling of the broader terrorism issue.\n\nThe President's job approval rating remains stagnant at 43%, and the percentage of Americans who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55%, up from 50% in April.\n\nEight weeks is a long time, and Democrats insist they will again surprise us with superior voter outreach and turnout. However, for now, the numbers are compelling: a weak President and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave or a significant ripple.",
    " Title: China's National Security Law in Hong Kong: Implications and International Response\n\nArticle:\n\nChina is moving to rewrite Asia's geopolitical map with the imposition of a sweeping national-security law in Hong Kong, bypassing the territory's elected Legislative Council. The new law will criminalize \"foreign interference,\" secession activities, and subversion of state power.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been gradually eroding Hong Kong's freedoms since the 1997 handover from Great Britain, despite assurances to maintain the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework for 50 years. The past decade has seen a significant decrease in Hong Kong's autonomy, culminating in massive demonstrations in 2019.\n\nThe new national-security law will also alter Hong Kong's Basic Law, its constitution, and allow China's security services to operate openly in the territory, further reducing its sovereignty. The CCP's move to take over Hong Kong's remaining freedoms is seen as a breach of international agreements and a demonstration of the CCP's willingness to disregard international law and morality.\n\nThe proposed national-security law's implications extend beyond Hong Kong, raising concerns about China's intentions towards Taiwan. The democratic island nation, which recently inaugurated President Tsai Ing-wen for a second term, has rejected Beijing's attempts to force Taiwan into a similar \"one country-two systems\" model. The CCP's actions in Hong Kong may signal a more aggressive approach towards Taiwan.\n\nThe international response to China's actions in Hong Kong has been weak, with some countries considering the issue an internal Chinese affair. The United States has released a \"Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China,\" warning that Beijing \"challenges the bedrock American belief in the unalienable right of every person to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nThe U.S. can limit its direct options but can pressure China to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning its abrogation of Hong Kong's Basic Law. Travel bans on high-ranking CCP officials and military officers, sanctions on technology transfer to China, and asylum for Hong Kong's democratic leaders and other at-risk individuals are potential measures.\n\nRestricting engagement with China and offering America as a haven for Hong Kongers are small steps, but they send a message of hope to those resisting Beijing's attempts to redraw Asia's map.",
    " Title: Solar Panels Installed on White House Roof: A Step Toward Renewable Energy\n\nArticle:\n\nTechnicians have completed the installation of solar panels on the White House roof, marking the culmination of a project initiated by President Obama to demonstrate the feasibility and environmental benefits of renewable energy. The solar panels were first proposed by Obama in 2010, with plans to install them on the family's new residence in 2011, providing solar-generated power for water heating and electricity. However, the project was delayed until late 2013.\n\nThe White House has not disclosed the number of solar panels installed or their cost due to security and other concerns. The solar panels are expected to generate 6.3 kilowatts of solar power when the sun is shining, according to the White House.\n\nPresident Obama aims to use this personal example to encourage families and businesses to take steps to reduce reliance on foreign energy and cut emissions linked to global warming. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz stated, \"Solar panels at the White House are a really important message that solar is here, we are doing it, we can do a lot more.\"\n\nThe installation process involved drilling down to the concrete on the White House roof and using epoxy glue and threaded rods to install a gridded subassembly onto which the solar panels could be secured. The solar components, converters, and labor for the installation were all domestic, according to the White House, which declined to name the companies involved in the project due to security concerns.\n\nJames Doherty, the White House usher, commented, \"Being at the White House, we do have some security concerns. We can't cover the entire roof, although that would be good from an energy savings standpoint.\"\n\nSome climate change activists have criticized the years of delay as a lack of urgency. Bill McKibben of the environmental group 350.org described the project as symbolically significant but also depressingly protracted. \"At this pace, we'll solve global warming right about the time that we're 30 feet under water,\" McKibben said in an interview.\n\nPresident Obama is not the first to deploy solar energy at the White House. President Jimmy Carter invested $30,000 in a solar water-heating system for West Wing offices in the late 1970s, but his successor, Ronald Reagan, removed the panels upon moving in. President George W. Bush's solar systems powered a maintenance building and some of the mansion, as well as providing heated water for the pool.",
    " Title: Expanded Participants in June 2016 Trump Tower Meeting Confirmed\n\nArticle:\n\nThe number of individuals who attended the controversial June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower has grown to eight, according to recent reports. The meeting, which included Donald Trump Jr., Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, and music publicist Rob Goldstone, among others, has reignited claims of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nRinat Akhmetshin, identified by NBC as a Russian-American lobbyist, has confirmed his attendance at the meeting. Akhmetshin, who denies any ties to Russian intelligence agencies, told the Associated Press that Trump Jr. had asked Veselnitskaya for evidence of illicit money flowing to the Democratic National Committee. However, Veselnitskaya stated that she did not have such information.\n\nAkhmetshin also reportedly mentioned that Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner seemed eager for the meeting to conclude. Two more men are believed to have attended the meeting, including former State Department contractor Anatoli Samochornov, who has ties to Veselnitskaya, and another unnamed individual.\n\nTrump Jr.'s attorney, Alan Futerfas, told Fox News that he could not confirm Samochornov's attendance at the meeting, but stated that one of the two other attendees was a U.S. citizen. Other reports characterize an unnamed attendee as a \"former Russian counter-intelligence officer\" and a friend of Russian singer and billionaire scion Emin Agalarov.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) stated, \"The growing and still mysterious meeting roster adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting.\" Schiff continued, \"Whether the additional party or parties present during the meeting with these top Trump campaign personnel at the time Donald Trump had seized the nomination were connected directly with Russian intelligence or not, it is clear the Kremlin got the message that Donald Trump welcomed the help of the Russian government in providing dirt on Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nNeither Kushner's attorney nor spokesperson have commented on this matter. Goldstone and Manafort did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.",
    " Title: The Potential Impact of a Trump Presidency on the Supreme Court and the Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nMany conservatives and libertarians are considering voting for Donald Trump due to concerns about liberal control of the Supreme Court. They believe that Hillary Clinton's potential judicial appointments would be detrimental, while Trump, despite his flaws, is perceived as supportive of originalist jurists who uphold limited government and constitutional checks and balances.\n\nTrump's list of potential justices, including judges such as Diane Sykes, Neil Gorsuch, and Robert Young, is seen as a positive by some conservatives. However, the article cautions against placing too much faith in Trump's list, citing his lack of understanding of the judicial process and his volatile temperament.\n\nThe article argues that a Trump presidency could have a transformative effect on the Republican Party, potentially leading to a shift away from originalism and limited government. This internal threat, it suggests, may be greater than the external threat posed by a Clinton presidency.\n\nThe article also discusses the relative independence of the Supreme Court, noting that partisan disagreements do not significantly impact the court's decisions. It warns that a Trump presidency could lead to a series of constitutional crises, citing his response to Judge Gonzalo Curiel as an example of his potential behavior.\n\nFurthermore, the article suggests that a Trump presidency could lead to a change in the Republican Party's judicial philosophy, moving away from originalism and towards judicial deference. This shift could result in a focus on executive powers, a narrow view of freedom of speech, and tight restrictions on civil liberties.\n\nThe article concludes by warning that voting for Trump out of concern for the Supreme Court and originalism could be akin to handing the keys to an arsonist, with the potential for significant damage to both the Supreme Court and the Republican Party.",
    " Title: US and EU Agree to Lower Tariffs, Avert Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and the European Union (EU) have agreed to avoid an all-out trade war and work towards lowering tariffs, following a meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House. The agreement, hailed by Trump as \"a very strong understanding,\" marks a \"new phase\" in EU-US relations.\n\nThe threat of US tariffs on European cars has been put aside, with the EU planning to increase imports of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and soybeans. The two leaders agreed to \"work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.\"\n\nHowever, US import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, imposed in March, will remain in place. A working group of senior advisers will meet to facilitate trade and lower barriers, with both sides pledging to refrain from imposing new trade restrictions during these negotiations.\n\nThe potential for a full-blown trade war had been looming due to the tariffs introduced by Trump. EU-US relations have been strained by Trump's comments towards Russian President Vladimir Putin, his attacks on NATO, and the EU. Trump's language after meeting Juncker was more positive, contrasting with his previous angry tone towards the EU, which he once described as a \"foe\" on trade.\n\nTrump has faced domestic pressure due to retaliatory tariffs imposed on US goods by China, the EU, Canada, and Mexico. US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc appears to be the latest casualty of the trade row with China, having dropped a $44bn bid to take over NXP Semiconductors after China failed to give approval for it.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration announced up to $12bn in aid for US farmers hurt by the Chinese tariffs. Speaking at the White House, Trump declared a \"new phase in the relationship\" between the US and the EU, calling it a \"very big day for free and fair trade.\" Juncker thanked the president and hailed a \"constructive meeting.\"\n\nThe EU's increased LNG and soybean purchases are not a promise to interfere in market forces, but rather a response to existing market trends. \"We are not turning into a Soviet-style economy,\" said an official. This agreement is not a revival of the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) or a significant free trade agreement, as it would require the consent of EU member states and take much longer to negotiate.\n\nThe pair also agreed to work towards reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trump has accused the WTO of treating the US unfairly, though mostly the US has won in arbitration cases there. The agreement does not include any announcement on car tariffs, and it is unclear whether progress has been made on resolving this issue. Trump had threatened to impose 25% import tariffs on European cars.\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom described the agreement as \"turning a page\" on trade, while German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted, \"Juncker showed in Washington that it's not about who tweets most aggressively, but about whether one offers real solutions. Because Trump's grassroots also feels that it only loses when we impose more and more senseless tariffs on each other.\"\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the agreement, but called for \"clarifications.\" He said there was no point trying to clinch any major trade deal with the US. Agriculture must be excluded, he said, because Europe could not compromise on food safety and environmental standards.\n\nTrump scorned the proposed EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which stalled two years ago. However, his \"deal\" with Juncker echoes some of TTIP's ambition. A former US Ambassador to the EU, Anthony Gardner, made this point in a tweet.",
    " Title: Iranian Cyberattack on U.S. Navy's Unclassified Network Lasted Over Four Months, Report Says\n\nArticle:\n\nA reported four-month-long cyberattack on the U.S. Navy's largest unclassified computer network has raised concerns among some lawmakers regarding security vulnerabilities exposed by the attack. According to The Wall Street Journal, citing current and former U.S. officials, the cyberattack targeted the Navy Marine Corps Internet, a network used for hosting websites, storing non-sensitive information, and handling voice, video, and data communications.\n\nThe hackers reportedly remained in the network until November 2020, contradicting initial reports from officials when the attack was first publicly disclosed in September 2020. At that time, officials told The Wall Street Journal that the intruders had been removed.\n\nA senior U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal that the Iranians were able to conduct surveillance and compromise communications over the unclassified computer networks of the Navy and Marine Corps. However, another senior official stated that no email accounts were hacked, and no data was stolen. There is also no evidence that Iran was able to penetrate classified U.S. computer networks.\n\nThe cyberattack is one of the most serious infiltrations of government computer systems by the Iranians, according to The Wall Street Journal. U.S. defense officials were reportedly surprised at the skill of the hackers, who entered the network through a security gap in a public-facing website.\n\nThe military response to the hack was overseen by Vice Adm. Mike Rogers, President Obama's pick to be the next head of the National Security Agency. Congressional aides told The Wall Street Journal that Rogers would likely face questions on plans to address security issues that have surfaced as a result of the attack. A confirmation hearing for Rogers has not yet been scheduled.\n\nDespite the length of the operation to remove the hackers, officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal praised Rogers for his leadership of the cybersecurity response. The issue is not expected to prevent Rogers from being confirmed as NSA director.",
    " Title: Congress Demands Private Emails of IRS and EPA Employees as Clinton Email Scandal Expands\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of developments, one of the tea party groups targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has requested Congress to demand the private emails of some agency employees, while the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman has issued a request for instant-chat messages from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Clinton email scandal, which initially involved former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is now enveloping other parts of the Obama administration.\n\nThe White House, in an attempt to distance itself from the growing scandal, has maintained that President Obama and Mrs. Clinton did email, but the White House followed all record-keeping laws, and the president was unaware of Mrs. Clinton's exclusive use of a private email until last week.\n\nCatherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote, which had its tax-exempt application blocked for years by IRS employees, suggested that more than a dozen current and former IRS employees may have used personal emails to avoid public scrutiny while targeting tea party groups with intrusive scrutiny. Engelbrecht also called for congressional committees investigating the IRS to delve deeper into whether any agency employees did the same as Clinton.\n\nIn a related development, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith has demanded that the EPA turn over more documents, including emails and text messages, or face subpoena. The EPA has been criticized for failing to follow open records laws, with a federal judge last week blasting the agency for its lack of transparency.\n\nHillary Clinton's email practices are only now coming to light, two years after she left the State Department. The department has stated that every previous secretary of state also used a private email account, and it is requesting copies of official emails to complete its records.\n\nDepartment spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Clinton turned over 55,000 unclassified emails to the department, but it is unclear when they will be released. The spokeswoman also said it is not automatically against the law to have used private email for public business, despite it being the best practice.\n\nAt the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged that the State Department was asking Clinton to turn her business-related messages over, but would not speculate on whether an independent arbiter should be called in to determine what should be turned over. Earnest stated that the decision on releasing more emails is ultimately up to Clinton's team.",
    " Title: Joe Biden Reverses Position on Hyde Amendment, Aligns with Democratic Party on Abortion Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the presumed frontrunner for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination, reversed his long-held support for the Hyde Amendment on Thursday, a move that aligns him with the party's stance on abortion funding.\n\nIn a speech at a Democratic National Committee gala in Atlanta, Biden did not mention the mounting pressure or criticism he received in recent days regarding his previous support for the Hyde Amendment. Instead, he credited the change as part of developing a comprehensive healthcare proposal.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, named for former GOP Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, was first passed in 1976 and is renewed annually by Congress. It bans federal funding of abortion, allowing exceptions only in cases of rape, incest, or when a pregnant person's life is at serious risk.\n\nBiden, who is looking to pitch a centrist approach in an increasingly progressive primary field, explained that the Hyde Amendment is another barrier to abortion access, which disproportionately affects poor women and women of color.\n\n\"I've been working through the finer details of my health care plan like others in this race, and I've been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,\" Biden said. \"Circumstances have changed, and the measure stands in the way of my goals 'universal coverage' and providing 'the full range of services women need.'\"\n\nBiden's support for the Hyde Amendment marked a sharp split from most of his 2020 competitors, as well as from the Democratic Party's platform. In 2016, the party amended its presidential platform to explicitly call for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, describing it as among the \"federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman's access to abortion.\"\n\nSeveral 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, and Reps. Cory Booker, Tim Ryan, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, have all co-sponsored legislation to overturn the amendment.\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Thursday that she was glad to see Biden had reversed course. \"At a time where the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Roe are under attack, we need full-throated allies in our leaders,\" she said. \"We're pleased Joe Biden has joined the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in coalescing around the Party's core values\u2014support for abortion rights and the basic truth that reproductive freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of equality and economic security in this country.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Stock Market Experiences Historic Losses Amid Coronavirus Fears\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. stock market has been experiencing a significant downturn, with a period of historic gains coming to a halt due to fears that the coronavirus epidemic may reach America. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) finished lower for a fifth consecutive day, with the S&P 500 index also experiencing losses.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at -3.61%, marking its biggest reversal from an intraday high of 461.42 points, to a 124-point loss since Dec. 21, 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data. This puts the Dow 8.78% away from its Feb. 12 record-high close of 29,551.42, approaching correction territory at 26,596.28, defined as a drop of at least 10%, but not greater than 20%, from a recent peak.\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPX) closed at -3.58%, and the Nasdaq Composite (COMP) ended at -3.83%. The S&P 500 is off 7.97% from its recent record high on Feb. 19, while the Nasdaq is off 8.52% from its Feb. 19 all-time closing high after a tepid gain on Wednesday.\n\nThe fear of the COVID-19 disease infecting the U.S. is intensifying. The illness, derived from the novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, is starting to affect global trade and travel and taking a bite out of confidence about earnings and economic growth.\n\nNancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Tuesday that \"the disruption of daily life might be severe.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization hasn't declared the viral infection a pandemic, but the disease, from the family of viruses known as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has sickened people in China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Italy, and Iran. According to Reuters, Austria, Spain, Croatia, and Switzerland have also confirmed their first cases.\n\nThe virus has virtually crippled swaths of manufacturing in China, the second-largest economy in the world, and the country is a significant buyer of products and services from other countries. U.S. technology companies such as Apple Inc. (AAPL), HP Inc. (HPQ), and Mastercard Inc. (MA) depend on Chinese supplies.\n\nAt last check, COVID-19 has sickened 81,312 cases, and claimed 2,770 lives. President Donald Trump was scheduled to hold a news conference about the virus Wednesday evening.\n\nInvestors don't know how long the outbreak will last, and it is too early to determine to what degree it will hurt corporate earnings, but a number of companies, including Hasbro Inc. (HAS), HP Inc. (HPQ), and Mastercard Inc. (MA), have already said that they think it will.\n\nUncertainty about the U.S. presidential election's outcome is also starting to drive markets, strategists and analysts argue. A number of them think that if Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who characterizes himself as a democratic socialist, wins the Democratic presidential nomination, and possibly even the presidency, stocks would take a hit as he is perceived by some as an antibusiness candidate. \"The risk to U.S. stocks is pretty significant if Bernie gets the nomination,\" said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst with OANDA.\n\nEven before the market slump this week, the value of stocks has been viewed as rich. One measure of stock-market values showed that the S&P 500 index was trading at 18.9 times the weighted aggregate consensus forward earnings estimate among analysts polled by \u2588\u2588\u2588. That is up from 16.2 a year ago, and, aside from a brief point early in 2018, it is the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio for the benchmark index since May 2002.\n\nGovernment bonds yields have been sliding steadily as investors seek safe havens, and thus drive up bond prices, amid doubts about global economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -19.60% carved fell to a record low below 1.32% earlier Tuesday, and the 30-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD30Y, -10.27% rate notched its all-time low last week.\n\nBond investors fear that the coronavirus might result in a global economic slowdown that might wash up on U.S. shores as a full-fledged recession. \u2588\u2588\u2588 economics writer Rex Nutting explained the potential for an uncontained outbreak of COVID-19 this way: \"Much of the immediate economic impact of a pandemic can be traced to the efforts to contain it, rather than from the effects of the disease itself. As we attempt to quarantine those who might spread the disease, we shut down a lot of economic activity.\"\n\nA Congressional Budget Office study found that a pandemic \"could produce a short-run impact on the worldwide economy similar in depth and duration to that of an average postwar recession in the United States.\"",
    " Title: IRS Faces Scrutiny Over Line Dancing Video Amidst Tax-Exempt Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is under renewed scrutiny following the release of a video showing a dozen of its employees line dancing. The video, which was produced at a cost of approximately $1,600, was one of three videos that were given to Congress last Friday in response to a request by Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThe line dancing video, which lasts just under three minutes, was recorded in 2010 and was shown at the end of a training and leadership conference held in Anaheim, California. The video, which features IRS employees dancing to music that sounds like \"Cupid Shuffle\" by performer Cupid, was produced at a time when most government agencies are implementing across-the-board spending cuts.\n\nThe video is the latest in a series of videos produced by IRS employees, with the agency also producing parodies of the \"Star Trek\" and \"Gilligan's Island\" TV shows. The \"Star Trek\" video, which cost about $59,000 in total, was produced for the same 2010 conference, while the \"Gilligan's Island\" parody was used at the beginning of a 12-hour video in 2011 to train IRS workers on various tax issues.\n\nThe \"Collected and Wasted: The IRS Spending Culture and Conference Abuses\" report, which is set to be released next week by a Treasury inspector general, will be the subject of a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday.\n\nRep. Boustany stated, \"Whether it is the tens of thousands of hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent to produce frivolous entertainment for agency bureaucrats, or the IRS\u2019s own admission that it targeted the American people based on their personal beliefs, the outrage toward the IRS is only growing stronger.\"\n\nIn a written statement, the IRS called the line dancing video \"unacceptable and an inappropriate use of government funds.\" The agency also stated that it has new policies in place \"to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used appropriately.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, Danny Werfel, the IRS's new acting commissioner, called the 2010 conference \"an unfortunate vestige from a prior era.\" Werfel added, \"While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department, of which the IRS is a part, stated that it puts \"the highest priority on protecting taxpayer dollars.\" It added that it would work with Werfel as he reviews his agency's operations and tries to \"restore public confidence in the IRS.\"\n\nThe 2010 conference was attended by 2,600 IRS workers from 350 offices around the country that handle tax returns for small businesses and self-employed individuals.",

Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has issued a subpoena to the State Department on Tuesday, demanding additional documents related to the controversial talking points used in the aftermath of the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack. The subpoena seeks documents from ten current and former employees not included in the last batch of emails from the department.\n\nIssa claims that the State Department has not complied with the administration's promises of cooperation with Congress and has issued the subpoena to compel the department to produce relevant documents. The subpoena is specifically targeting communications related to talking points from nine State Department officials.\n\nRepublicans have accused the White House of stripping the talking points, which were used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice in Sunday show appearances the weekend after the attacks, of all references to \"terrorism\" to achieve a political goal. The White House turned over 100 pages of emails earlier this month, arguing that these emails show that CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell, not State spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, was the one who first suggested removing terrorism references from the talking points.\n\nIssa's subpoena requests the correspondences of several State Department officials, including Nuland, Cheryl Mills, a top aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who Republicans have accused of being the force behind the efforts to mount a political cover-up in the aftermath of the attacks. The requests also include the records of William Burns, the deputy secretary of State, and Beth Jones, the acting assistant secretary for Near East Affairs, who has also been the subject of criticism by Republicans.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, argued that the subpoena is just more politics and an attempt to smear Clinton in advance of a possible 2016 presidential run.\n\n\"House Republicans appear to be obsessed with Hillary Clinton and are distracting Congress from conducting responsible oversight to protect our diplomatic personnel serving overseas,\" said Cummings in a statement. \"This investigation has been politicized from the beginning as House Republicans accuse first and then scramble to find evidence to back up their unsubstantiated claims.\"",

Bolton reportedly describes Moon as \"schizophrenic,\" according to Reuters.\n\nSouth Korea's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, stated that Bolton's published account of internal deliberations between the heads of state sets a \"dangerous precedent.\" Chung added that unilaterally publishing consultations made based on mutual trust violates the basic principles of diplomacy and could severely damage future negotiations.\n\nPresident Trump has responded forcefully to the book, denying its claims and attacking Bolton as a \"wacko.\" In a tweet last week, Trump called Bolton's book \"exceedingly tedious\" and \"made up of lies and fake stories.\" Trump also tweeted that Bolton, who he fired, was a \"disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the book's publication, claiming that Bolton violated rules against publishing classified information. Copies of the book have already been released to the press, making the lawsuit largely moot for the sake of protecting any privileged information.\n\nOn Saturday, D.C. Circuit Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled in the case, denying a Trump administration request to block the book's publishing date. Lamberth also warned Bolton that if he did not receive approval from the administration before publishing the book, he could forfeit his $2 million book advance and possibly more.\n\n\"Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,\" Lamberth wrote in his decision, according to The New York Times. \"He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.\" However, Lamberth added that the government had failed to establish that an injunction would prevent irreparable harm.\n\nTrump cheered the ruling, tweeting that it was a \"BIG COURT WIN against Bolton.\" Trump also said, \"Bolton broke the law and has been called out and rebuked for so doing, with a really big price to pay.

    " Title: An Analysis of the Impact of President Trump's Impeachment on Stock Market Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe claim made by former President Donald Trump that stocks would crash if he were to be removed from office is a topic of debate, with some suggesting that corporate earnings and valuation could play a significant role in determining the stock market's performance.\n\nSince Election Day 2016, the S&P 500 has experienced an annualized growth rate of 20%, significantly higher than the historical return of 9.4% since 1927. However, it is worth noting that the Trump return is only about 1 percentage point higher than the yearly gain since March 2009, an era primarily overseen by President Barack Obama.\n\nChanges in earnings forecasts under Trump have been substantial compared to historical trends. In December 2017, analysts predicted S&P 500 earnings of about $146 a share for 2018, forecasts that, due largely to the president's tax cuts, soared over the next two months, rising four times as fast as any period tracked by the data provider. Companies delivered on these expectations, with S&P 500 operating income jumping 24% in each of the last two quarters, and analysts predicting combined EPS of $159 a share for all of this year.\n\nPredictions for 2019 profits also soared, going from $163 a share at the start of the year to $177 a share now, an upward revision that dwarfs any since at least 2012. Additionally, there has been a small increase in valuations, with the S&P 500 fetching 20.07 times annual earnings on Election Day 2016 and 20.7 times now.\n\nWhile looking at earnings in isolation ignores numerous other factors that could influence the stock market's response to political events, the income lens is a useful tool for understanding the potential impact of impeachment on stocks. Analysts are skeptical of the president's impeachment prospects and believe any market volatility or sell-off would be short-term in nature.\n\nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. in London, stated, \"The market isn't hinging on anything substantial that hasn't already been carried through. The markets have largely rallied on tax reform, and we've seen that reflected in company earnings. But if there's political instability and the U.S. economic growth slowed significantly, that would have global implications.\"\n\nNicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote, \"Equity markets don't seem to care, and we think they are right. Rates are low, the dollar is strong, and corporate earnings remain robust. Those are the only things stock prices can (and should) actually discount.\"\n\nIt is important to note that past instances of presidential turmoil have shown contrasting stock returns. In February 1974, when Congress initiated impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon, the market was in the midst of a bear market due to an oil crisis and an implosion of the world's foreign exchange rate system. The S&P 500 tumbled more than 30% through October that year.\n\nIn contrast, in December 1998, when the House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton, stocks continued to rise during the last stage of the Internet boom. The S&P 500 climbed for five straight months until Clinton's acquittal in February 1999.\n\nAs of 9:45 a.m. in New York, the S&P 500 was virtually unchanged, and the index barely budged Wednesday in the aftermath of the convictions of Trump associates that sparked renewed discussion of a potential impeachment.",
    " Title: Catalan Separatist Leaders Sentenced to Prison Terms, Sparking Protests in Barcelona\n\nArticle:\n\nProtests have erupted in Barcelona, Spain, following the Supreme Court's sentencing of nine Catalan separatist leaders to prison terms ranging from nine to 13 years. The leaders were convicted of sedition for their roles in an illegal independence referendum in 2017. Another three were found guilty of disobedience and fined but not jailed.\n\nThe sentencing occurred on Monday, with the 12 defendants denying the charges. Large crowds of pro-independence protesters clashed with police at Barcelona's international airport, resulting in 108 flight cancellations, according to Spanish airport authority Aena. Thousands of Catalan independence supporters also marched in the city center, blocking some streets and access to metro stations.\n\nThe longest sentence of 13 years was handed to Oriol Junqueras, the former vice-president of Catalonia and the highest-ranking pro-independence leader on trial, for sedition and misuse of public funds. The prosecution had sought up to 25 years in prison for Junqueras.\n\nFormer Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who is living abroad, was issued a new European and international arrest warrant on grounds of sedition and misuse of public funds. He fled to Belgium in October 2017 to avoid prosecution in Spain following the failed independence bid.\n\nJunqueras accused Spain of jailing people for their political ideals and pledged that the separatists would return even stronger. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez insisted the leaders had been jailed for criminal conduct.\n\nThe sentences handed down have shocked many across Catalonia. The Catalan National Assembly called for \"mobilisations around the globe\" using the hashtag #StandUpForCatalonia. Both FC Barcelona and the Catalan football federation condemned the prison sentences and called for \"dialogue and negotiation\" to resolve the situation.\n\nIn 2017, police and protesters clashed in the streets when Catalonia's pro-independence leaders went ahead with the referendum, which had been ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court. Other separatist leaders to receive prison sentences for sedition were Jordi S\u00e0nchez, activist and ex-president of the Catalan National Assembly (9 years), and Jordi Cuixart, president of Catalan language and culture organization \u00d2mnium Cultural (9 years).\n\nThe nine leaders, who had already spent months in pre-trial detention, were acquitted of a more serious charge of rebellion. During their closing arguments in June, defense lawyers told the court their clients denied the charges of rebellion and sedition but admitted to the lesser charge of disobedience, which could have seen them be banned from public office but avoid prison.\n\nProsecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion. They also said that separatist leaders had misused public funds while organizing the 2017 referendum. Prosecutors argued the leaders had carried out a \"perfectly planned strategy... to break the constitutional order and obtain the independence of Catalonia\" illegally.\n\nForcadell, the former parliament speaker who read out the independence result on 27 October 2017, was also accused of allowing parliamentary debates on independence despite warnings from Spain's Constitutional Court. Some of the leaders, speaking to the BBC ahead of the trial, said the proceedings were political in nature. Any violence, they said, was on the part of police and committed against voters in a crackdown which made headlines around the world.\n\nThree weeks after the banned 2017 vote, the Catalan parliament declared an independent republic. Madrid stepped in to impose its rule on the region, and several Catalan leaders fled or were arrested. Catalan nationalists have long complained that their region, which has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years, sends too much money to poorer parts of Spain, as taxes are controlled by Madrid. The wealthy region is home to about 7.5 million people, with their own language, parliament, flag, and anthem. In September, a march in Barcelona in support of Catalonia's independence from Spain drew crowds of about 600,000 people - one of the lowest turnouts in the eight-year history of the annual rally.",
    " Title: Five Killed, Two Injured in Maryland Newspaper Shooting; Journalists Press On\n\nA gunman opened fire at the Capital Gazette newspaper office in Annapolis, Maryland on Thursday, resulting in the deaths of five employees and injuries to two others. The shooter, Jarrod Warren Ramos, has a history of hostility towards the newspaper, including a lawsuit and harassment of its journalists on Twitter.\n\nRamos was charged with five counts of first-degree murder. Tom Marquardt, a retired publisher and top editor at the paper, stated, \"I was seriously concerned he would threaten us with physical violence. I even told my wife, 'We have to be concerned. This guy could really hurt us.'\"\n\nOn Twitter, Ramos hinted that he'd enjoy seeing two journalists \"cease breathing.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, the Capital Gazette journalists have shown resilience, working from a makeshift newsroom in a parking lot to ensure the newspaper is published. Their shock is profound, but they continue to serve their readers.\n\nIn the broader media landscape, there has been a predictable cycle of finger-pointing, opportunism, and condemnation of cultural and political factors thought to be at the core of recent mass shootings. It is human nature to seek an explanation for the unfathomable.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to avoid hateful castigations and volatile rhetoric. Such language only serves to dehumanize and we do not need more of that. The reason for this senseless massacre remains unclear, but it is evident that no sane person would commit such an act.\n\nThere may be concerns regarding the accessibility of the weaponry involved and various toxic cultural influences, but at the heart of this issue lies a mental health concern.\n\nLegislation such as the \"red flag\" gun bill, on the brink of becoming law in Massachusetts, may be a positive step. The bill focuses on the mental health aspect of gun ownership.\n\nLet's continue to work on this issue, regardless of the various political sensitivities at play.",
    " Title: The United States Faces a Regime of Uncertainty: An Analysis of Current Economic Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy is currently grappling with a pervasive sense of uncertainty, a condition coined by economist Robert Higgs as \"regime uncertainty.\" This situation arises when investors lose confidence in the government's respect for property rights, making long-term investment difficult.\n\nOne form of regime uncertainty is policy uncertainty, which occurs when investors are confident in basic property rights but fear that changes in public policy may render their investments unprofitable. For instance, the Affordable Care Act's employer health-insurance mandate, which covers firms with 50 or more full-time employees, is a point of contention. While some Democrats propose lowering the threshold, Republicans aim to repeal it altogether, creating uncertainty for employers with 40-50 employees.\n\nPresident Trump and some Democrats have expressed intentions to alter the taxation of private-equity firms, potentially doubling their tax burden. This could deter potential investors in the private-equity sector, as well as those in other industries with \"carried interest\" income that might be affected by changes in tax policy.\n\nThe Trump administration's stance on NAFTA, along with the opposition from many in Congress, creates uncertainty for multinational projects involving the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The temporary nature of tax cuts, due to sunset provisions, also contributes to this uncertainty.\n\nAnother issue is the national debt and the deficits that contribute to it. The debt poses straightforward problems, such as the potential for debt-service payments to become burdensome, but there are also related problems stemming from efforts to reduce the deficit. Tax cuts, for example, often have temporary sunset provisions, leading to endless debates about renewing them.\n\nThe Trump administration and Republicans in Congress aim to pass a tax cut using the reconciliation process to avoid a potential Democratic filibuster. However, these tax cuts will also be temporary, expiring in ten years. This approach to tax cuts, along with the administration's chaotic approach to healthcare reform, contributes to the overall sense of uncertainty in the economy.\n\nTo address this uncertainty, a reasonable, sober, and sustainable settlement on the national fiscal challenge is needed. Without predictability, the economy will continue to face real costs in terms of economic growth, employment, wages, and future prosperity. The current regime of uncertainty is a departure from the certainty that was once valued by the Republican Party.",
    " Title: United States Announces Withdrawal from United Nations Human Rights Council\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has announced its intention to withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council, according to Reuters. The decision comes a day after the U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, criticized the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant parents from their children as \"unconscionable.\"\n\nThe move was expected, as it aligns with the Trump administration's stance against what it perceives as the U.N.'s anti-Israel bias. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, had previously stated that the U.S. would leave the council unless its \"chronic anti-Israel bias\" was addressed. Haley has also advocated for reforms aimed at making it easier to expel egregious human rights abusers from the council.\n\nThe U.S. had previously boycotted the council under the George W. Bush administration before rejoining under Barack Obama. The Trump administration has since made a practice of withdrawing from U.N. organizations perceived as having an anti-Israel bias.\n\nThe Human Rights Council is not without criticism. While its members are theoretically required to \"uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights,\" some countries, such as Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and Saudi Arabia, have been admitted. The membership system, based on regional blocs, allows for easier circumvention of a full vote on admittance.\n\nCriticism of Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is warranted, but the council's focus on this issue, to the exclusion of other global conflicts and human rights violations, has been a point of contention.\n\nWhile human rights groups argue that it would be more productive for the U.S. to stay and advocate for reforms, the Trump administration's domestic and international human rights record has come under scrutiny. With the administration under fire for alleged egregious human rights abuses at the U.S.-Mexico border and President Trump's comments suggesting a desire for American citizens to \"sit up at attention\" like they do in North Korea, the U.S. is currently not considered a credible voice for reform on this issue.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Yet to Contact State Election Officials Regarding Alleged Voter Fraud Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nDespite repeated claims by the Trump administration that widespread voter fraud exists and a pledge to conduct a thorough investigation, it appears that the White House and the Department of Justice have not contacted top state election officials across the country regarding the matter.\n\nThe Huffington Post reached out to all 50 secretaries of state and election officials in the District of Columbia, and none of them responded to confirm that they had been contacted by the White House or the Department of Justice regarding the investigation.\n\nIt is unclear whether the administration will release any information or evidence to support their claims of voter fraud. Some speculate that, if the White House feels pressured to provide evidence, they may release an unsourced report compiled by White House interns, referencing sources such as Alex Jones, Breitbart, or other controversial figures as evidence of voter fraud.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the administration will provide further details on the alleged investigation, but it is noteworthy that, as of now, no state election officials have confirmed contact from the White House or the Department of Justice.",
    " Title: Ukrainian Rebels Recruit Fighters, Raise Funds in Moscow as Kremlin Denies Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 Ukrainian rebels are openly recruiting fighters, raising money, and collecting combat gear in Moscow, the capital of Russia, despite the Kremlin's denial of supporting the pro-Russia fighters. The recruiting office for the Donetsk People's Republic does not have a street address, but volunteers can join by calling a number or writing an email.\n\nThe U.S. State Department acknowledged last month that the office exists and that Russia allows it. Recruitment efforts are advertised through colorful fliers and banners at rallies in Moscow and on the internet, calling on Russians to \"Join Strelkov's Army,\" referring to Igor Strelkov, a former Russian security officer who heads the insurgency's militia.\n\nThe recruiting comes as the Ukrainian military intensifies its campaign against the pro-Russian insurgents and is closing in on the largest rebel stronghold of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Russia has amassed about 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's eastern border, according to NATO.\n\nDetailed instructions about the recruitment office appeared on Russia's VKontakte social network in June on the page of the Donbass People's Militia. Some Russian websites reported having recruitment posts as early as May. The VKontakte page included a phone number and email address for the militia, but phone calls went unanswered.\n\nArtur Gasparyan, a volunteer fighter from Armenia, told Russia's Radio Svoboda that after his second attempt to contact the VKontakte group, several unidentified men scheduled a meeting with him and ten other recruits in Moscow before he was sent to fight in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine and the West accuse Russia of arming the insurgents who seized government buildings in the cities of Donetsk in April, proclaimed independence from Kiev, and pledged closer ties to Russia. Kiev then launched its offensive against the insurgents. According to the United Nations, about 1,000 people, including hundreds of civilians, have been killed in the clashes.\n\nThe U.S. and others say that weapons are continuing to cross from Russia into Ukraine\u2014possibly including surface-to-air missiles that may have downed a Malaysia Airlines jetliner last month, killing all 298 on board. Russia maintains it is not arming the rebels.\n\nSupport for the insurgency is widespread in Russia, where a majority of the population views the rebels as fighting a pro-Western regime they think is hostile to Russian-speaking people who live in Ukraine.\n\n\"If weapons and aid are going into eastern Ukraine, then that cannot be happening without the approval of the Kremlin,\" said Alexander Konovalov, president of the Moscow-based Institute of Strategic Assessments. \"Several different factions of the Kremlin might have their own policies, but one man approves this,\" he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAmid that support, public efforts to gather aid are widespread\u2014whether for volunteers, supplies, or money. A flier from Strelkov's militia requesting \"humanitarian aid\" listed a variety of combat gear, such as army boots, optical sights for AK-47s, night-vision glasses, and camouflage. The equipment is being gathered by a group called the Foundation for Aid to Novorossiya and Donbass.\n\nDuring a Moscow rally last week, the group filled a 5-ton truck with food, clothes, and military equipment. Among the donated items was a generator for an armored personnel carrier, the foundation said.\n\n\"Ordinary people will get this aid. Of course, some of this is for the militiamen. It will go straight to the leadership of the Donetsk People's Republic,\" said Sergei Zakharov, a resident of Kramatorsk, Ukraine, who was in Moscow to help the foundation, as men loaded boxes into the truck.\n\nThe group said it raised 6.2 million rubles (about $177,500) in just over a month between June and July.",
    " Title: CNN Anchor's Laughter Sparks Controversy, Bolsters Trump's Support Base\n\nArticle:\n\nA video of CNN news anchor Don Lemon laughing hysterically during a segment that mocked President Donald Trump's supporters went viral this week, sparking controversy and raising questions about the impact on the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn the video, which was clipped from a live broadcast that aired on Saturday night, Lemon can be seen laughing and at one point slamming his head on his desk. The laughter ensued after ex-GOP strategist Rick Wilson joked that Trump would be too stupid to find Ukraine on a map, followed by calling Trump's supporters the \"credulous boomer rube demo.\"\n\nCNN contributor Wajahat Ali then joined in, saying, \"You elitists with your geography and your maps\u2014and your spelling!\" Wilson added, \"Your math and your reading! Your lines on the map!\"\n\nBy Tuesday night, Lemon addressed the controversy on his show, stating, \"Ask anyone who knows me, they'll tell you\u2014I don't believe in belittling people, belittling anyone for who they are, what they believe.\" He continued, \"During an interview on Saturday night, one of my guests said something that made me laugh. And while in the moment, I found that joke humorous. And I didn't catch everything that was said.\"\n\nHowever, it appears that Lemon's defense\u2014that he didn't catch everything the panelists were saying\u2014is questionable. Lemon laughed consistently during and after the jokes, indicating that his laughter was a response to the jokes themselves.\n\nLemon's behavior has been criticized for reinforcing negative stereotypes and potentially alienating Trump supporters, who may view the mockery as a confirmation of their shared opposition to the mainstream media and liberal elites. The incident has also been compared to Hillary Clinton's \"deplorables\" comment, which, rather than turning people away from Trump, further solidified his supporters' loyalty.\n\nThe use of stereotypical Southern accents by the panelists during the segment could also have negative consequences for CNN, as it may turn off voters in rural areas who are undecided politically. Trump can point to this segment as evidence of his claim that his opponents don't respect his supporters or rural Americans.\n\nFurthermore, the clip provides ammunition for Trump's claim that CNN is \"Fake News.\" The laughter and stereotypical accents in the clip make it easier for Trump to tell his supporters that all news coming from CNN is biased, and therefore not reliable. It makes it more likely that they will blindly believe Trump, who hasn't insulted them, and less likely that they will believe that anyone affiliated with CNN could ever have a legitimate criticism.\n\nLemon, who has not apologized for his behavior, did not respond to requests for comment.",
    " Title: The Dangers of Certitude in Climate Change Discourse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a reflection on his career as an environmental reporter, Andrew Revkin noted a growing disparity between the scientific understanding of global warming and the claims made by climate change advocates. While the increase in global temperature since 1880, by 0.85 degrees Celsius or approximately 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit, is indisputable, the science behind many other accepted facts is a matter of probabilities. This is particularly true of the complex and fallible models and simulations used by scientists to predict future climate scenarios.\n\nRevkin's observations serve as a reminder that hyperbole about climate change, while it may not have been accurate at the time, could potentially be counterproductive if the aim is to engage a distracted public. Instead of asserting total certainty about the science, acknowledging its limitations and uncertainties is a more honest approach.\n\nClaiming absolute certainty about the science can undermine the spirit of science, creating doubts whenever a climate claim proves incorrect. Demanding immediate and costly changes in public policy raises questions about the ideological intentions behind such demands. Making moral judgments and treating skeptics as unintelligent or despicable does not win over many supporters.\n\nThis article is not intended to deny climate change or its potential severity. However, it is important to recognize the public's right to be skeptical of an overbearing scientism. History has shown that scientific errors combined with political power can lead to human wreckage.\n\nThe epigraph for this column is borrowed from the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz, who understood the dangers of certitude. Perhaps if there had been less certitude and more questioning in Hillary Clinton's campaign, she would be the current president. Perhaps if there were less certitude about our climate future, more Americans would be interested in having a reasoned conversation about it.",
    " Title: Media Coverage of Tara Reade's Allegations Against Joe Biden Lags Compared to Other High-Profile Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ascent of former Vice President Joe Biden to the presumptive Democratic nominee for president has been marked by numerous challenges, including allegations of sexual assault made by Tara Reade, a former staffer who worked for Biden in the early 1990s. Reade alleges that Biden sexually assaulted her and was subsequently retaliated against professionally for complaining to his staff.\n\nHowever, the media coverage of Reade's allegations has been noticeably muted compared to the extensive coverage given to similar allegations against other high-profile political figures, such as Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and Al Franken. This discrepancy in coverage has sparked debate and concern among journalists, editors, and commentators.\n\nOne possible explanation for the lack of interest in this story from Democrats and many in the media is the influence of politics and bias. The deafening silence about Tara Reade on MSNBC, for example, is difficult to account for with any other explanation. Headlines in mainstream outlets like The Washington Post, such as \"Developments in allegations against Biden amplify efforts to question his behavior,\" contort to avoid injuring Biden.\n\nAnother plausible reason for the muted coverage is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken up nearly all of the media's attention. As Washington Free Beacon Editor Matt Continetti told Fox's Brett Baier, \"I'm worried that this is one area that Joe Biden may be being shielded by coronavirus. As long as the attention of the nation is on the pandemic, I think he may be able to skirt some of these questions for a little while longer.\"\n\nDespite the allegations, Biden has yet to directly address them. After releasing a statement denying the allegations, Biden held a virtual town hall on Tuesday, focusing on the pandemic's impact on women. In the town hall, Biden boasted of his endorsement from Hillary Clinton and ignored the allegations entirely. There were no questions about Reade.\n\nThe campaign has circulated talking points to top Democratic supporters, instructing them to say of the allegations, \"this did not happen.\" The lack of engagement with the allegations benefits no one, least of all Biden himself.\n\nPolitical dangers and credibility concerns are at the forefront of this issue. If voters find Reade's allegations credible and Biden consequently loses support, there is little the party can do after he is officially their nominee. Credibility concerns also extend to Biden, Democrats, the media, and Biden's Democratic women supporters.\n\nHuffington Post asked nine potential vice-presidential picks about the allegations, and only one\u2014Stacey Abrams\u2014responded. After defending Biden's character, she went on CNN, where Don Lemon asked her directly about the allegations. Abrams dutifully repeated the Biden talking point: \"I know Joe Biden and I think that he is telling the truth, and that this did not happen.\"\n\nIn the #MeToo era, this is a precarious position for a progressive Democrat to take. The silence or support from prominent Democratic women, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michelle Obama, and others, risks their own credibility with women.\n\nIt is possible that Biden's assumption that voters' antipathy for Trump will supersede any qualms they may have with his behavior regarding Reade or any of the other women who have complained about unwanted touching is correct. Plenty chose not to care about the multiple allegations against Trump in 2016.\n\nHowever, that is even more reason for Biden, Democrats, and the media to address the allegation fully and head-on, allowing voters to decide what to believe. This story is unlikely to go away, and pretending it isn't real is ignoring a ticking time bomb.",
    " Title: Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Birth Control Rules Nationwide\n\nArticle:\n\nPennsylvania Eastern District Judge Wendy Beetlestone has issued a nationwide injunction, halting the Trump administration's birth control rules from taking effect across the United States. The ruling stems from concerns that states could be impacted by fallout associated with residents losing contraceptive coverage.\n\nIn a statement, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said the rules \"affirm the Trump Administration's commitment to upholding the freedoms afforded all Americans under our Constitution.\"\n\nAs of Monday, employers in 37 states are no longer mandated by law to provide birth control coverage for their workers, due to new rules implemented by the Trump administration. The guidelines will not go into effect in 13 other states and the District of Columbia, following a judge's decision in Oakland, California, that blocked the rules' implementation hours before they were set to take effect.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers were required to offer birth control coverage to their employees at no additional cost. Religious organizations that objected were previously exempt from providing coverage, but the Trump administration broadened the provisions to exempt any employers with either religious or \"moral convictions\" that would preclude them from offering birth control coverage.\n\nThe state of California sued to prevent the rules from going into effect. On Sunday, Judge Haywood Gilliam granted an injunction to those states that joined California's suit, but he declined to block the rules nationwide.\n\nGilliam acknowledged that the ruling meant women in states not covered by the injunction could lose birth control coverage, but said the \"high threshold\" needed to implement a nationwide injunction wasn't met.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra hailed the decision in a statement Sunday. \"The law couldn't be more clear \u2014 employers have no business interfering in women's health care decisions,\" Becerra said. \"Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.\"\n\nCourts previously blocked a similar rule the Trump administration attempted to implement back in 2017.",
    " Title: Rent Collection Concerns Mount as Economic Struggles Persist for Renters and Landlords\n\nArticle:\n\nThe economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic is causing growing concerns among apartment landlords that an increasing number of tenants may struggle to make their rent payments, even after most managed to pay for April. John Pawlowski, a senior analyst at real estate research firm Green Street Advisors, stated, \"May 1 will be a bigger watershed. Think about when the job losses started accelerating.\"\n\nAccording to the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), a trade group for the apartment industry, only 69% of renters had made a full or partial payment during the first week of April. By April 26, the figure had climbed to nearly 92%. While dire predictions for April were mostly inaccurate, few see the pressure abating on renters or property owners.\n\nLoan forbearance, expanded unemployment benefits, and other government programs aimed at softening the blow will only go so far. The industry, which includes small, individual owners with a few properties to large companies with national portfolios, faces a potential cascading damage. Mortgages, utilities, and property taxes still have to be paid regardless of whether rent is collected.\n\nLarge apartment landlords, including Equity Residential and Camden Property Trust, have reported strong collections, leading analysts to predict they'll fare better than smaller owners. However, many factors will influence if or when people are able to make rent in May, from the timing of job losses to whether tenants have received stimulus checks or state unemployment benefits.\n\nEven assistance won't be enough in high-cost areas, like New York and California, according to Doug Bibby, NMHC's president. \"We're nervous,\" said Bibby. \"The only mitigating factors are the direct payments to households, individuals, and children, and the unemployment checks that are coming in -- and those are coming in sporadically.\"\n\nDaryl Carter, the CEO of landlord Avanath Capital Management, anticipated that renters at his company's roughly 10,000 units from California to Florida would struggle in April and gave them a 10% discount. Despite this, he prepared to process as many as a thousand requests to modify rent. In the end, fewer than 50 residents asked for relief. He's bracing for next month to be different.\n\nSome renters are already behind. Chris Davis, 31, used his tax refund to help pay bills in March. Then, late last month, he had to self-quarantine after his daughter got sick. Missing more than two weeks of work meant he couldn't make the $785 April rent payment for his family's two-bedroom apartment in North East, Maryland. He's been back working at a truck wash for more than a week, but catching up will be tough, let alone making a payment for May.\n\nOther renters aren't able to apply for government benefits. A Brooklyn woman, who asked that her name not be used because of her immigration status, recently lost work as a home health aide. Because she's undocumented, she's unable to collect unemployment and is worried that she'll run through her modest savings trying to pay the $1,700 rent on her family's one-and-a-half-bedroom apartment. She plans to withhold her rent this coming month, joining a rent strike to pressure Governor Andrew Cuomo into forgiving monthly payments during the pandemic.\n\nFor Bruce Brunner, a small landlord in Minneapolis, there's a less adversarial route: working with renters on a case-by-case basis to find a solution everyone can afford. In recent weeks, he said nearly all his tenants have been able to pay because they still have jobs or were able to collect unemployment. Still, he's been flexible, working with renters to split the shortfall when necessary. \"None of this is brain surgery,\" Brunner said. \"We're just everyday people helping each other out.\"",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Asks President Trump to Stop Tweeting About DOJ Matters\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr has asked President Donald Trump to stop tweeting about Department of Justice (DOJ) matters, stating that the president's comments make it \"impossible\" for him to do his job as the head of federal law enforcement.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, scheduled to air Thursday evening, Barr expressed his desire for Trump to \"stop tweeting.\" The president's comments, particularly regarding the case of his advisor Roger Stone, have been corrosive to the image of the Justice Department, which has a tradition of independence, according to Barr.\n\nBarr clarified that Trump has never asked him to intervene in a criminal case, but the attorney general added that Trump's comments surrounding the Stone matter have been detrimental to the department's reputation.\n\n\"As I said at my confirmation hearing, I think the essential role of the attorney general is to keep law enforcement, the criminal process sacrosanct, to make sure there is no political interference in it,\" Barr said in the material released by ABC.\n\nBarr admitted to directing the submission of a second memo in Stone's case recommending a lighter punishment. The initial sentencing recommendation for Stone, who was convicted by a jury last year in a case stemming from the Russia investigation, was seven to nine years in prison.\n\nTrump criticized the recommendation on Twitter, and the same day, a senior Justice Department official told NPR that leaders at the department's headquarters in Washington found the suggested sentence too harsh. The department then directed the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., to submit a second memo seeking less punishment, which it later did.\n\nFour federal prosecutors who had brought the case to that point all withdrew, according to court records. The senior DOJ official said leaders at headquarters had decided on their own, after seeing the sentencing memo, that they would request a revision.\n\nBarr made clear in the interview with ABC that he made the decision, but the public response following Trump's post on Twitter made it appear that Barr and the department were bowing to the president's desire to protect his friend.\n\nDemocrats have demanded an investigation, and Barr has agreed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee for a hearing scheduled for next month. His relationship with the Democratic-controlled House has been strained since a dispute with its chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., prompted Barr to skip a hearing last spring amid a dispute over witnesses and evidence.\n\nThis week, Trump praised Barr for \"taking charge\" of the Stone case, further compounding the perception that the attorney general was taking instructions from Trump. However, Barr, in the excerpted ABC News interview, stated that this is not the case, but the appearance that he is puts him in a difficult position\u2014which is why the attorney general says he wants the president to keep silent.",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Existential Threat Amidst COVID-19 Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is posing a significant challenge for the United States, with many critics pointing to the lack of preparedness and suitability of President Donald Trump for the job. The petulance, lack of discipline, short attention span, narcissism, lies, and need for public praise and approval that were once considered charming advantages or manageable eccentricities have been exposed as glaring deficiencies in an American president.\n\nThe Republican Party, which has heavily supported Trump, is now facing a potential loss not just in the presidency but also in the U.S. Senate in the 2020 elections. According to National Journal's Josh Kraushaar, Democratic candidates have outraised their Republican counterparts in eight out of the ten most competitive Senate races, often by substantial margins.\n\nThis development is largely attributed to Trump's handling of the crisis. Despite previous warnings about the possibility of a massive crisis, Republicans have made a risky political calculation by overlooking Trump's character flaws.\n\nIn a recent development, Democratic candidate Joe Biden is leading in several traditionally Republican states such as Ohio, Arizona, and Florida. However, it is important to note that elections are still several months away, and outcomes can change.\n\nCritics of Trump, often referred to as Never Trumpers, have long warned about the potential risks of a leader with such character flaws. Despite Trump's acquittal in the Senate and initial political success, his handling of the COVID-19 crisis has led to a renewed focus on his leadership style and its impact on the Republican Party.\n\nThe situation recalls a biblical parable comparing a wise builder to a foolish one. The moral is that one should always build their house on a rock, as eventually, the rain comes, the streams rise, and the winds blow. The implication is that no amount of public relations spin can save a house built on sand, a metaphor that some have applied to Trump's presidency.\n\nWhile it is not appropriate to wish for a deadly virus to serve as a lesson, the hope is that the current crisis will lead to a renewed appreciation for attributes like character, temperament, and experience in future leaders. This could help future Americans to benefit from the lessons being learned now.",
    " Title: Israel Urges U.S. to Maintain Aid to Egypt Amid Political Instability\n\nArticle:\n\nIsrael has reportedly urged the United States not to suspend its annual $1.3 billion in military and economic aid to Egypt following the ouster of President Mohammed Morsi by the Egyptian military. Under U.S. law, aid must be suspended to any country where the government is overthrown by the military, but the U.S. has yet to determine whether the June 30 removal of Morsi constitutes a coup.\n\nAccording to the Haaretz newspaper, Israeli leaders engaged in \"marathon phone calls\" with their U.S. counterparts over the weekend, expressing concerns that a suspension of aid could impact Israel's security and potentially undermine its 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly spoke with Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon with Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, and National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror with his U.S. counterpart, Susan Rice.\n\nThe Israeli leaders warned that cutting military aid to Egypt could negatively impact Israel's security, particularly given the possibility of further security deterioration in the Sinai Peninsula. The peninsula, which borders Israel and the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, has seen a rise in Islamist militancy since the overthrow of former president Hosni Mubarak in February 2011, leading to increased attacks on both Israel and Egypt's own forces stationed there.\n\nIsrael fears any change in U.S. policy could undermine the Egyptian army's commitment to the 1979 treaty, as U.S. aid to Egypt, which began as a result of the treaty, has continued uninterrupted since 1979. The Israeli government has not confirmed or denied the report.\n\nSince Morsi's ouster, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered his ministers to remain silent on the unfolding political crisis in Egypt. A senior official in Netanyahu's office stated that Egypt is likely to experience \"a period of chronic instability,\" and that the Muslim Brotherhood, to which Morsi belongs, is unlikely to easily give up power, potentially leading to more violence and changes in leadership.\n\nLast week, the Israeli army confirmed it had \"authorized\" the deployment of Egyptian military reinforcements in the Sinai Peninsula to address security threats that pose a threat to both Israel and Egypt. The 1979 treaty imposes strict controls on the numbers of troops permitted to operate there. Israeli public radio also reported on Israel's efforts to dissuade Washington from halting aid to Cairo.",
    " Title: New CNN/ORC Poll: Hillary Clinton Leads Democratic Race, No Clear Leader in Republican Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the 2016 presidential nominations, a new CNN/ORC poll indicates that the Democratic contest is solidifying around Hillary Clinton, while the Republican race remains undecided.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton dominates with a significant lead, while the Republican race has seen some stirring with the recent entries of Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz. However, no clear leader has emerged in the Republican race.\n\nIn the latest poll, Jeb Bush holds the top spot among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, with 17% of the vote. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker follows closely behind with 12% of the vote. Rubio and Paul stand at 11% each, with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee at 9% and Texas Senator Ted Cruz at 7%. Former neurosurgeon Ben Carson and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who were previously strong contenders, are now behind the leader with 4% each.\n\nBush's lead in the nomination contest is slight, and several contenders could overtake him with a small increase in support. Bush is most often named as the candidate with the right experience to be president (27%), the one with the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee in the general election next November (26%), and as the strongest leader in the large field of GOP contenders (21%). He is also more often seen as the candidate with the clearest vision for the country's future (19%), who cares the most about people like you (18%), and who most closely shares your values (19%).\n\nOn the question of who best represents the future of the Republican Party, Bush and Rubio are in a close race, with 18% and 18% respectively. Paul is the only other candidate in double digits on this question, with 10%.\n\nThe poll suggests that while Bush currently holds the lead in the Republican race, there is room for other candidates to gain ground, particularly Rubio, who is seen as a strong representative of the future of the Republican Party. The Democratic race, on the other hand, appears to be more solidified around Clinton.",
    " Title: Economic Decline and Government Shutdown in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe quality of life in the United States has reportedly seen a significant decline in recent years, often attributed to the Age of Obama. This perceived decline has allegedly eroded the American dream, strained the economy, and made job creation more challenging.\n\nPresident Obama's administration has been criticized for dividing the nation through class warfare tactics and for failing to deliver on promises of creating good-paying, full-time jobs. The ongoing debate over the government shutdown has overshadowed these economic concerns, with the Affordable Health Care Act (Obamacare) being a major point of contention.\n\nCritics argue that Obamacare imposes numerous regulations, taxes, and costly provisions on the economy and businesses, which could potentially lead to job losses. Small businesses are reportedly laying off workers or reducing their hours to avoid providing health insurance due to the full-time employee threshold.\n\nThe economic impact of Obamacare, as well as other troublesome economic repercussions, has been largely overshadowed by the government shutdown discussion. The shutdown has resulted in furloughs for workers, closed national parks, and affected food-safety inspections, among other issues.\n\nIn an attempt to spark a debate over Obamacare and potentially delay its implementation, House Republicans withheld a \"clean\" continuing resolution to fund the government. However, this strategy has not led to the desired debate or delay in Obamacare's implementation. Instead, the political focus remains on the government shutdown.\n\nAs the shutdown continues, the economy, high unemployment, slow job creation, and weak economic growth have been largely overshadowed in the public discourse. The White House, in response to the shutdown, has called on top Wall Street leaders to warn of a potential economic catastrophe if the debt limit is not raised by October 17.\n\nRepublicans have been criticized for their response to the shutdown, with some arguing that they are not effectively communicating the negative economic impact of Obamacare. The late Jack Kemp, a former Republican politician and economist, was known for his successful arguments for tax cuts to promote stronger job growth. Republicans are urged to adopt similar strategies to criticize President Obama's economic record and the potential negative effects of Obamacare on the economy.\n\nA Washington Post-Miller Center Poll from late September revealed that a large majority of Americans have a more pessimistic view of their economic future. The poll found that 75% of respondents found it harder to \"find good jobs,\" 71% found it harder to \"save for retirement,\" 66% found it harder to \"get ahead financially,\" and 54% found it harder to \"find decent, affordable housing.\"\n\nIt is suggested that Republicans should take a more aggressive approach in their criticism of the Obama administration's economic record and the potential negative effects of Obamacare on the economy.",
    " Title: June 2015 Breaks Record as Hottest June on Record Globally\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal scientists announced on Monday that June 2015 was the hottest June on record for the planet, marking the third consecutive record-warm month globally this year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information reported that the globally averaged temperature over land and ocean surfaces for June 2015 was the highest for the month of June since record-keeping began in 1880.\n\nThe record warmth was seen in June in the western U.S., parts of northern South America, several regions in central to western Africa, central Asia, and parts of southeastern Asia, according to the centers. June 2015 broke the previous record for warmest June, set just last year, according to NOAA's data.\n\nEarlier this year, both March and May set marks for record warmth. The U.S., overall, had its second-warmest June on record, the centers announced last week. Only June 1933 was hotter. Five western states\u2014California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Utah\u2014were all record warm.\n\nThe hot June continues the pattern of unusual warmth seen throughout the year. So far, the first six months of the year have been the warmest on record, due in part to El Ni\u00f1o, a climate pattern marked by warmer-than-average water in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The heat from the warm water helps boost temperatures in the atmosphere around the world.\n\nWhile El Ni\u00f1o is a part of the warmth, the long-term trend of man-made climate change is also a contributor. NOAA reports that 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000, many during years without the boost of an El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nJanuary-June was 1.53 degrees F warmer than average worldwide, NOAA said.",
    " Title: Trump Warns of Traffic and Commercial Delays at U.S.-Mexico Border Due to Increased Immigration Enforcement\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a warning on Saturday about potential traffic and commercial delays at the U.S.-Mexico border due to increased immigration enforcement. The president's statement came after the administration's decision earlier in the week to increase the number of immigration officers processing Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Trump stated, \"We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border's specific Ports of Entry to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States.\" He continued, \"This will cause traffic & commercial delays until such time as Mexico is able to use... its powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin.\"\n\nThe president also urged congressional Democrats to collaborate with Republican lawmakers to address the \"horrible, costly and foolish loopholes\" in U.S. immigration statutes. He tweeted, \"Once that happens, all will be smooth.\" The president concluded, \"We can NEVER allow Open Borders!\"\n\nOn Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen directed Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to expedite the \"temporary reassignment of personnel and resources from across the agency to address the influx of migrants.\" Additionally, plans were announced to require that greater numbers of non-Mexican asylum-seekers stay in Mexico while their cases are resolved.\n\nPresident Trump had earlier threatened to shut down the southern border, but on Thursday, he stated that he would first impose auto tariffs on Mexico in an attempt to reduce the rate of illegal drugs entering the U.S. \"Before we close the border, we'll put the tariffs on the cars,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I don't think we'll ever have to close the border.\"",
    " Title: John Dowd Calls for End to Russia Probe, Cites Corruption Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Dowd, personal attorney to President Donald Trump, has called for the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller to be terminated. In an email to Betsy Woodruff at the Daily Beast on Saturday, Dowd expressed hope that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would follow the \"brilliant and courageous example\" set by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in firing FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Friday.\n\nDowd initially stated he was speaking on behalf of the president, in his capacity as the president's attorney. However, he later clarified that he was speaking in his personal capacity and not on the president's behalf. The email was in response to a request for comment about McCabe's firing.\n\nDowd's email included the text of the president's late Friday tweet on the subject, celebrating the ouster as a \"great day for Democracy.\" He also urged Rosenstein to follow Sessions' example and dismiss Mueller, citing an alleged Russia collusion investigation based on a \"fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\"\n\nSessions' recusal from matters related to the 2016 campaign means Rosenstein is overseeing Mueller's probe and is the one with the ability to fire the special counsel. Dowd also quoted a line from the Tennessee Williams play, \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" to emphasize his point, stating, \"There ain't nothin' more powerful than the odor of mendacity... You can smell it. It smells like death.\"\n\nTrump has been hinting at publicly calling for Mueller's dismissal, but has not done so explicitly. The president has publicly and privately expressed anger at Sessions over his recusal from the case of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and has engaged in a sustained attack against Sessions, the FBI, and the Justice Department. Trump told NBC News he fired FBI Director James Comey, in part, because of the Russia probe, which he described as a \"made up story.\" The New York Times reported in January that Trump attempted to order Mueller be fired last June but backed down after White House counsel Don McGahn threatened to resign over the matter.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-VA) tweeted on Saturday, \"Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now.\" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA) tweeted that \"every representative should condemn this flagrant abuse of power or stop pretending devotion to duty.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) stated in January that if Trump were to fire Mueller, it would be \"the end of President Trump's presidency.\"\n\nDowd's email was sent just two days after a New York Times report that Mueller has subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization, including some related to Russia.",
    " Title: Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588 Calls for Caution in Egypt Aid Amid Ongoing Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the escalating crisis in Egypt, Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588, a Kentucky Republican, has expressed support for the delay in the delivery of F-16 fighter jets and the cancellation of scheduled joint military exercises. This decision comes as members of Congress reconsider the provision of military aid to Egypt.\n\nSenator \u2588\u2588\u2588 introduced an amendment last month aimed at halting aid to Egypt during the current period of unrest. The amendment was based on two primary reasons:\n\n1. The U.S. law stipulates that aid should be suspended following a coup. Given the conventional definition of a coup, the events in Egypt meet this criteria.\n2. A nation in the midst of a violent civil war should not be armed with American-supplied weapons. Previously provided F-16s to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were used against protesters who eventually overthrew his regime. These protesters were part of the forces that would later elect President Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe current regime has since been overthrown, but the American weapons remain. The question of who will use them now, and the potential consequences for U.S.-Egyptian relations, is a concern for Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nSenator \u2588\u2588\u2588 argues that sending $1.5 billion in aid is unnecessary when there are no clear good or bad actors and when there is no clear American national interest. As more in both parties reconsider intervention in Egypt, Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588 questions whether the situation has to become so violent before politicians reassess U.S. policies or deviate from Washington groupthink.\n\nWhen Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588's amendment to stop Egyptian aid failed three weeks ago, some in the press characterized this as a rebuke. A more accurate understanding would be that Congress is out of step with the people, as more than 80% of Americans\u2014and Egyptians\u2014oppose further military aid.\n\nIn recent days, news sources have shown images of unarmed protesters attempting to stop tanks (American tanks operated by the Egyptian military) and an unarmed man being shot while trying to halt a tank. Sending more American tanks is not engagement, and providing more fighter jets does not benefit the Egyptian people, according to Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nSenator \u2588\u2588\u2588 criticizes the hyper-interventionism in Washington, where leaders in both parties seem to act first and think second. They insist on sending Egypt billions in aid because, as Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588 puts it, \"it's what we've always done.\"\n\nSenator \u2588\u2588\u2588 serves on the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees. The question remains whether the current shift in sentiment towards ending aid is merely rhetoric or whether Senator \u2588\u2588\u2588's new \"allies\" will actually vote to end aid.",
    " Title: President Trump Delivers Remarks at National Prayer Breakfast Following Acquittal\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, a day after his Senate acquittal in his impeachment trial. The event's theme was \"love your enemies.\"\n\nDuring his speech, President Trump took veiled shots at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Mitt Romney, who voted to convict him in the impeachment trial. He criticized individuals who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong and those who claim to pray for others but do not genuinely mean it.\n\nThe president's comments appeared to be in reference to Speaker Pelosi, who had previously stated that she had prayed for President Trump during the impeachment inquiry. They also seemed to be directed at Senator Romney, the lone Republican senator to vote to convict President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump expressed his gratitude to Republican lawmakers who voted against impeachment, praising their courage, wisdom, fortitude, and strength. He also reiterated his support for freedom of religion, pro-life policies, and prayer in schools.\n\nThe president held up front-page newspaper headlines proclaiming his acquittal when he entered the ballroom for the breakfast at the Washington Hilton to applause. Speaker Pelosi was seated on the opposite side of the dais and did not acknowledge the president during her prayer, in their first encounter since she ripped up a copy of his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nIn her prayer, Speaker Pelosi asked for prayers for those persecuted across the globe, including journalists in Saudi Arabia, and expressed a hope that \"we treat everyone with dignity and respect.\"\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, Michigan Republican and one of the hosts of the breakfast, told the president, \"We want this to be a blessing for you. We want to let you know there are people from all over the world here who have been praying for you.\"",
    " Title: Trump Objects to Proposed U.S. Restrictions on Jet Engine Sales to China\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump objected to U.S. proposals that would prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China's aviation industry on Tuesday, stating he had instructed his administration not to implement them. In a series of tweets and comments to reporters, Trump expressed concerns that national security should not be used as an excuse to make it difficult for foreign countries to buy U.S. products.\n\nThe president's comments came after reports over the weekend by various news media, including Reuters, that the government was considering whether to stop General Electric Co (GE.N) from further supplying engines for a new Chinese passenger jet. Trump's views on the issue contrasted with the sharp restrictions his administration has placed on U.S. companies trading with Huawei Technologies, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, also for national security reasons.\n\nTrump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing for a trip to California, \"We're not going to be sacrificing our companies... by using a fake term of national security. It's got to be real national security. And I think people were getting carried away with it.\"\n\nThe United States has supported American companies' business with China's aviation sector for years. \"I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult.\"\n\nTrade lawyer Doug Jacobson said limitations on jet engines and chip makers would hurt U.S. companies. \"This is ultimately akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face because ultimately you're hurting U.S. manufacturing companies but you're not having a material impact on your target,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two largest economies, have a complicated and competitive relationship. Trump signed a first-phase trade deal with China earlier this year after a long trade war in which the countries levied significant tariffs on each other's products, many of which remain in place.\n\nWashington is also eyeing limits on other components for Chinese commercial aircraft such as flight control systems made by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N). Central to the possible crackdown is whether shipments of U.S. parts to China's aircraft industry could fuel the rise of a serious competitor to U.S.-based Boeing Co (BA.N) or boost China's military capabilities.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said it welcomed Trump's comments. \"We applaud President Trump's tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability,\" said John Neuffer, the group's president, in a statement. \"As we have discussed with the administration, sales of non-sensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation, which is critical to America's economic strength and national security.\"\n\nHuawei is at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China. Washington placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year, citing national security concerns. The United States has also been trying to persuade allies to exclude its gear from next-generation 5G networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim.\n\n\"So, national security is very important. I've been very tough on Huawei, but that doesn't mean we have to be tough on everybody that does something,\" Trump said.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Nathan Phillips' Account of Washington Incident: New York Times and Washington Post Correct Phillips' Claim of Vietnam Veteran Status, Contradict His Account of Events\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the discrediting of Nathan Phillips' account of his confrontation with a group of students in Washington, many on the left continue to support him, despite numerous corrections and clarifications from major news outlets such as the New York Times and the Washington Post.\n\nPhillips, who initially claimed to be a Vietnam or \"Vietnam-era\" veteran, has been revealed to be a stateside refrigerator technician who was frequently absent without leave (AWOL). Furthermore, it has come to light that Phillips made similar allegations against a few college students four years ago.\n\nInitially, a single video of the incident on Twitter led many journalists to uncritically accept Phillips' account of the confrontation, as the image appeared to reinforce preconceived notions: an elderly Native American surrounded by a group of smirking pro-Trump teenagers wearing MAGA hats. However, full videos of the incident soon showed that Phillips was the one who approached the students unprovoked, beating a drum just inches from their faces.\n\nContrary to Phillips' claims, the Covington school students were being taunted with racist and homophobic slurs by a group of Black Hebrew Israelites. Despite this, Phillips alleged that the students were \"in the process of attacking these four black individuals\" and \"looked like they were going to lynch them,\" prompting his intervention. It is unclear why Phillips did not beat his drum at the \"Israelite\" aggressors.\n\nThe video also contradicts Phillips' account in several other ways. For instance, there is no evidence that the students were defiantly chanting \"Build that wall,\" and Phillips' statements do not appear to be an attempt to pacify the situation.\n\nDespite the contradictions in his account, Phillips continues to have supporters, as he has crafted new narratives that appeal to left-liberal prejudice. In an interview with CNN, Phillips stated, \"Time for lies to be not accepted anymore.\"",
    " Title: Novel Fundraising Tactics Emerge in U.S. Political Campaigns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of campaign fundraising, creativity and unconventional methods have become the norm as candidates strive to stand out in a media-saturated environment and raise record amounts of cash.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's campaign has ventured into unique territory by suggesting that wedding registries include the campaign, and merchandising Vice President Joe Biden's gaffes, such as a \"Health Reform Still a BFD\" t-shirt. The Obama campaign has also capitalized on donations for President Obama's dog, Bo, with the proceeds benefiting his master.\n\nCongressional candidate Pam Gulleson, from North Dakota, attempted to turn a minor setback into fundraising gold when her campaign vehicle broke down on the trail in late June. She solicited donations for the repairs through an email to supporters, stating that 80 donations of $25 would cover the costs. The effectiveness of this fundraiser is uncertain, as the Gulleson campaign declined to comment on the matter.\n\nGimmicky raffles, offering access to candidates at dinners or sporting events, or face time with Hollywood celebrities, are also becoming common fundraising practices. Traditional fundraising events, such as rubber chicken lunches and after-work receptions, are not obsolete but are increasingly overshadowed by the need for seven-figure fundraising to remain competitive in even the most low-key congressional races.\n\nThe 2012 election is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history, with the Center for Responsive Politics estimating a cost of at least $5.8 billion. Novel fundraisers also coincide with a surge of new donation options this cycle, such as text message, Twitter, and mobile credit card readers, making political contributions more accessible than ever.\n\nCampaigns are eager to connect with younger voters, said Kristin Oblander, president of Atlanta-based political fundraising firm The Oblander Group. \"They work because you literally get buy-in with young professionals in particular who will stay on your email lists, like you on Facebook, connect on Twitter,\" she said. \"You just can't have the same old 100 folks in a smoky back room anymore.\"\n\nComparing the current fundraising landscape to the mid-1980s, Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) noted that his campaign's cash solicitations via direct mail seemed revolutionary at the time. \"I'd have balloon rides and parachute jumping,\" said Gordon, now a partner at law and lobbying firm K & L Gates, without a hint of sarcasm. \"Candidates just have to find more and more novel ways to break through the clutter of so many fundraisers.\"",
    " Title: EPA Chief Lisa Jackson Resigns Amidst Speculation of Keystone XL Pipeline Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nThe resignation of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Lisa Jackson last week has sparked speculation that the Obama administration may soon approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. According to a report by the New York Post, citing a source close to Jackson, the EPA chief resigned because she believed President Obama was planning to approve the pipeline project.\n\nThe source stated that Jackson, who was initially planning to stay in her position until November or December, decided to resign due to her opposition to the pipeline's approval. Jackson's spokeswoman, Victoria Rivas-Vazquez, referred back to Jackson's original statement that she wanted to \"pursue new challenges, time with her family, and new opportunities.\"\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast of the United States, has been a contentious issue for several years. The project has faced opposition from environmental groups due to concerns about its potential impact on the environment, particularly the risk of oil spills.\n\nHowever, the pipeline is considered to be the safest and most efficient way of transporting oil sands, and the oil is likely to be extracted regardless of whether the pipeline is built in the United States or in China. The State Department's review of the pipeline is still ongoing, but there have been indications that the project is moving closer to approval.\n\nIt is unclear whether Jackson's resignation is directly related to the Keystone XL pipeline or if it is one of several factors that led to her decision to step down. Jackson's use of an extracurricular email account has been a subject of controversy in the past, and it is possible that this may have played a role in her decision to resign.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline has been a contentious issue for several years, and its approval or rejection is likely to have significant implications for the United States' energy policy and its relationship with Canada. The pipeline's potential economic benefits, including job creation and increased energy security, have been a major point of emphasis for supporters of the project.\n\nIt is unclear when the State Department will make a final decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, but reports suggest that a decision could be made as early as March or April. The resignation of EPA chief Lisa Jackson has added fuel to the speculation that the pipeline's approval is imminent.",

The Airbus A320 jet, under Lubitz's control, crashed last week, killing all 150 people onboard. French officials have suggested the crash was intentional.\n\n Lubitz, 27, had been treated by psychotherapists \"over a long period of time,\" the statement said, without providing specific dates. In subsequent visits to doctors since that time, no signs of suicidal tendencies or aggression toward others were documented, according to the prosecutor.\n\n Under current German law, which emphasizes privacy, it was up to Lubitz to disclose his history to doctors examining his fitness to fly, according to Roland Quast, medical director of Aeromedical Center Germany in Stuttgart.\n\n \"What is decisive is that the pilot tells the truth,\" Quast said. \"If he lies, we don't have lie detectors.\"\n\n The medical history of Lubitz has raised questions over how much leeway medical professionals should have to inform the authorities about patients in positions that could affect public safety. Parliamentary deputies from Germany's governing coalition have called for doctors to break confidentiality when a patient shows suicidal tendencies.\n\n Karl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat and a medical expert, told the daily newspaper Bild that if lives could be endangered, \"the doctor has a duty to inform the employer about the unsuitability of the employee to do his work.\"\n\n \"That applies especially in the case of psychiatric illness and the possible danger of suicide,\" Lauterbach said.\n\n Heinz Joachim Sch\u00f6ttes, a spokesman for Germanwings, said Monday that the airline was aware of the prosecutor's statement about Lubitz but declined to comment.",
    " Title: Congress Ends Government Shutdown and Averts Debt Default\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress has ended the first government shutdown in 17 years and averted a default on U.S. debt following a late-night vote on Wednesday. The deal, brokered by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, only sets up further budgetary battles, as government funding will run dry again in January, and the borrowing limit must be lifted in February.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed the bill to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling early Thursday morning. Government workers were instructed to return to work on Thursday. In a statement, the White House said, \"Today, the president signed a continuing resolution that brings employees back to work and reopens many government functions.\"\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed executive departments and agencies to reopen offices in a prompt and orderly manner. The Office of Personnel Management also updated its website overnight to inform federal employees to return to work on their next scheduled day, which was Thursday for most, unless instructed otherwise.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner had to rely on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's Democratic Caucus to carry the bill to passage, violating the Hastert Rule, a mantra that the House speaker should not bring legislation to the floor without the support of a \"majority of the majority\" of his members.\n\nThe Senate passed the bill with 81 senators voting yes, and 18 voting against. The House then moved to clear the legislation 285-144, relying mostly on Democratic votes in the Republican-controlled chamber. The bill was opposed by 144 Republicans, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan.\n\nThe deal does not alter Obamacare, despite Speaker John Boehner's initial support for his conservative wing's drive to gut Obamacare as part of the government shutdown fight. McConnell and Reid worked overtime for three days to hammer out a bipartisan agreement after a House bill collapsed on Tuesday.\n\nThe legislation also includes a McConnell-written proposal that would allow Congress to disapprove of the debt-ceiling increase. Lawmakers will formally vote on rejecting the bump of the borrowing limit - if it passes, it could be vetoed by Obama. The deal would also deliver back pay to furloughed federal workers, require a study of income verification for people seeking health-insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and allows the Treasury Department to use extraordinary measures to pay the nation's bills if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling in a timely fashion.",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Order to Strengthen Medicare, Aims to Reduce Regulations and Drug Prices\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at strengthening the Medicare health program by reducing regulations, curbing fraud, and providing faster access to new medical devices and therapies. The order was announced during a visit to a retirement community in Florida, a critical political swing state.\n\nThe executive order is the Republican president's response to some Democrats who are pushing for a broad and expensive expansion of Medicare to cover all Americans. Trump referred to such proposals as socialist and pledged to prevent them from coming to fruition, a political promise with an eye toward his 2020 re-election campaign in which healthcare is likely to be a major issue.\n\nThe order pushes for Medicare to use more medical telehealth services, leading to cost reductions by reducing expensive emergency room visits. It also aims to bring payments for the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program in line with payments for Medicare Advantage. The order directs the government to work to allow private insurers that operate Medicare Advantage plans to use new plan pricing methods, such as allowing beneficiaries to share in the savings when they choose lower-cost health services.\n\nTrump's plans contrast with the Medicare for All program promoted by Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist who is running to become the Democratic Party's nominee against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Sanders' proposal, backed by left-leaning Democrats but opposed by moderates such as former Vice President Joe Biden, would create a single-payer system, effectively eliminating private insurance by providing government coverage to everyone, using the Medicare model.\n\nThe White House is eager to show Trump making progress on healthcare, an issue Democrats successfully used to garner support and take control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump campaigned in 2016 on a promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, his predecessor President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law also known as \"Obamacare.\" So far, he has not repealed or replaced it.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it would propose a rule for imports of cheaper drugs from Canada into the United States. A formal rule has not yet been unveiled. The administration also issued an executive order in June demanding hospitals and insurers make prices they charge patients more transparent. Another executive order was issued in July encouraging novel treatments for kidney disease.\n\nHowever, a federal judge in July shot down an executive order that would have forced drugmakers to display list prices in advertisements, and Trump scrapped another planned order that would have banned some rebate payments drugmakers make to payers. The administration is also reportedly mulling a plan to tie some Medicare reimbursement rates for drugs to the price paid for those drugs by foreign governments.",
    " Title: Divisions Among Republicans Affect Foreign Policy Stance in 2012 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing squabbling among Republicans in Congress has hindered the adoption of legislation this summer aimed at enhancing the nation's technological defenses and protecting infrastructure from digital attacks. This year's Congressional debate over the Law of the Sea Treaty, similar to the 2010 debate over the New Start treaty, which aimed to reduce Russian and American nuclear missile arsenals, reflects deep philosophical divisions within the Republican ranks.\n\nHistorically, Republican divisions over foreign policy have been between a realist wing and a more fervent nationalist wing; realism usually prevailed. In the 1950s, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, an internationalist, overcame Senator Robert A. Taft and his isolationist followers. Later, President Richard M. Nixon's engagement with China and President Ronald Reagan's diplomatic outreach to the Soviet Union won out over the skepticism of cold-war conservatives.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush ushered in a new level of infighting, from which his party has not recovered. Initially, neoconservatives like Paul D. Wolfowitz pushed a doctrine of preventive war and put it into effect in Iraq. Eventually, more pragmatic conservatives like Condoleezza Rice pulled the president back toward diplomacy.\n\nOver the last four years, Republicans have tried to paper over their divisions. In the 2008 and 2010 elections, foreign policy hardly figured at all. However, the Republican primary contest this year has bared the deep conservative disarray. This time, a new battle, between neoconservatives and neo-isolationists, all but crowded out the party's pragmatic internationalists, like James A. Baker III and Colin L. Powell.\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has dealt with these divisions in two ways. He has derided President Barack Obama's handling of foreign policy, notably on Iran and Israel, with overheated rhetoric but only vague hints at alternatives. On the few matters in which Mr. Romney has offered a clearer difference, he has echoed the confrontational approach taken by Dick Cheney, John R. Bolton, and other hard-line conservatives from the Bush years. For example, he called Russia the \"No. 1 geopolitical foe\" of the United States and said he would designate China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. His call for Republicans to block ratification of the New Start treaty put him at odds with all five living Republican former secretaries of state, including Ms. Rice.\n\nHowever, a mixture of cheerleading and fire-breathing does not make for a coherent and credible worldview. Now that he's the Republican nominee, Mr. Romney has an obligation to clarify his and his party's positions. It is imperative that he justify his plan to add more than $2 trillion in defense spending over the next 10 years and explain how the plan meshes with his proposals to simultaneously cut taxes, reduce the debt, and strengthen America's economy.\n\nMr. Romney should also explain what\u2014if anything\u2014he would do differently from President Obama in Egypt, which is perhaps the most important test today of America's support for democratic transitions around the world. He should go beyond clich\u00e9s to specify how, exactly, he would strengthen military cooperation with Israel\u2014which Israel's own defense minister, Ehud Barak, praised a month ago as \"more than anything I can remember in the past.\"\n\nAnd he needs to get specific about his tactical approach to Syria, where the United States is already trying to help the Syrian opposition, control which elements of it get foreign military aid, and isolate the murderous regime of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nMitt Romney hopes to persuade Americans not only that he can fix the economy but also that he can lead at a time of great uncertainty abroad. To do so, he needs to first unite his party by offering clear alternatives to the president's policies. Vague criticisms of Mr. Obama won't cut it.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Loses 701,000 Jobs in March, Unemployment Rate Jumps to 4.4%\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy experienced a significant setback in March, with a loss of 701,000 jobs, marking the first decline in payrolls since September 2010 and the steepest since March 2009, during the Great Recession. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent, up from a half-century low of 3.5 percent in February.\n\nThe employment report, based on surveys conducted in the early weeks of March, does not fully reflect the depth of the economic calamity inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic. In the final two weeks of the month, 10 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits, a stark indication of the scale of the economic crash.\n\nRestaurants, bars, hotels, airlines, cruise lines, automakers, and entertainment venues have been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, as a growing number of jurisdictions have ordered the closure of nonessential businesses and directed residents to stay at home.\n\nThe U.S. currently has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, with over 245,573 people infected, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 6,000 people in the country have died from the virus.\n\nEconomists' projections for unemployment vary significantly, but they generally agree that it will be severe. An analysis published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis last week projected that unemployment could reach 32 percent in the second quarter as more than 47 million workers are laid off due to the pandemic. This would surpass the 24.9 percent peak during the Great Depression.\n\n\"Much bigger job losses are coming,\" said Mark Zandi, Moody's chief economist, during a conference call with reporters earlier this week. He estimated that between 10 to 15 million jobs could be lost from the economy as a result of the outbreak, with the worst taking place in April.\n\nLawmakers are looking to provide relief to laid-off workers with a $2 trillion stimulus package, the largest relief bill in recent memory, which President Trump signed last week. The bill includes up to $1,200 cash checks for adults who earn less than $99,000 annually and expanded unemployment benefits.",
    " Title: CPAC 2013 Reflects Republican Party's Internal Divisions Four Months After Presidential Defeat\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which began on Thursday outside Washington, D.C., has become more of a carnival atmosphere than a conservative salon, according to a report by Associated Press (AP). The event, known for its annual gathering of conservative leaders and activists, is reflecting the state of the Republican Party four months after the party's latest presidential defeat.\n\nThe report highlights the divisions within the Republican Party, with establishment Republicans expressing frustration over the snubbing of popular GOP governors Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell, while conservatives are displeased with the presence of Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, who are seen as part of the \"country club crowd.\"\n\nThe event is attracting future Republican leaders, but it is also drawing figures from the past, many with headlines that are not desirable. A Republican gay group is not welcome, and hard-liners on immigration are also absent. The annual presidential straw poll is expected to again be won by a member of the Paul family, to the frustration of organizers.\n\nFor decades, the Republican Party has grappled with its moderate-conservative divide. However, the current state of the party is more complex than the traditional center vs. right paradigm, as illustrated by the CPAC gathering. Former Mississippi governor and Clinton-era Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour cautions that it is important for the Republican side to stick together on message and have more message discipline, especially with the Democratic Party holding the White House.\n\nHowever, as CPAC gets underway, it is the differences that are coming into stark relief. The gathering has long been seen as an early indicator of the state of conservatives, and that remains the case today. But unfortunately for the right, it is the GOP's identity crisis that is now being reflected by CPAC.\n\nThe report suggests that the three pillars of the conservative era ushered in by Ronald Reagan - a muscular defense, traditional cultural values, and devotion to free markets - are being questioned by leading Republicans. The future direction of the Republican Party is now being openly debated, with some Republican leaders questioning interventionist foreign policy, urging a more tolerant stance on gay rights, and considering the possibility of more revenue increases in exchange for a fiscal grand bargain.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is considering a presidential bid in 2016, seeks to remake the GOP in his image by embracing a more restrained foreign policy and a federalist approach on values issues. However, other party leaders, such as Haley Barbour, hope to downplay differences and believe consensus is the only way to be relevant in the Obama era. Open internal warfare, this view goes, merely offers aid and comfort to the opposition. In other words, Republicans can't even agree on whether they should litigate their disagreements.",
    " Title: \"NPR's 'Back at Base' Project Highlights Life of Vietnam War Veteran John H. McCarthy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a project titled \"Back at Base,\" NPR, along with seven public radio stations across the country, is chronicling the lives of American troops in their hometowns. Memorial Day monuments in various cities serve as reminders of the sacrifices made by these soldiers. One such monument is in the Allston-Brighton section of Boston, commemorating Staff Sgt. John H. McCarthy, who died in the Vietnam War.\n\nJohn McCarthy, born and raised in Allston-Brighton, never returned home after his second tour of duty in Vietnam. His brother, Richie McCarthy, recalls his big brother as a patriot who loved his country and believed in the righteousness of the war.\n\nGrowing up, the two brothers, born about two years apart, were close. They shared a talent for art, with Jack developing a perfectionist streak that often led him to repaint his works. By 1960, Jack had developed an interest in the military and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps on his 17th birthday.\n\nJack McCarthy excelled in the Marine Corps. In 1962, he was chosen for a training exercise observed by President John F. Kennedy. Later that year, he was assigned to a ship during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was sent to Vietnam for the first time in 1965, where he worked with local South Vietnamese villagers and rooted out the Viet Cong.\n\nIn a letter home in November 1965, Jack wrote, \"Dear Mom, I will really miss some of the people in this village... We have had a few more brushes with the V.C. in our area but we are getting smarter than them because we have been killing them. And they haven't hurt us for a long time.\"\n\nAfter 13 months in Vietnam, Jack returned stateside. However, by late 1967, he was called back to Vietnam for a second tour. He was severely wounded on the morning of Feb. 18, 1968, when he stepped on an enemy explosive device. He was evacuated to a Naval field hospital in Danang and was able to send some letters home before his condition worsened.\n\n\"Dear Mom, Sorry not to have written before but I'm feeling better now and am going to be okay. I'm lucky it wasn't any worse but I've lost my right leg, and the sight of my right eye. Do not worry about it. Please,\" he wrote in one such letter.\n\nDespite the efforts of surgeons, John McCarthy died on the morning of March 25, 1968, at the age of 24. His brother, Richie, reflects on his loss, saying, \"When I think of him, I just think what a shame it is he could not really live his life.\" Dan Daley, one of Jack's childhood friends, shares a similar sentiment, stating, \"You know, when I'd see his name on the wall like I was in D.C. recently, that's all I think of, what a shame, poor kid, he was so young. He never really had children or he did not really have a life, he was just starting out, and snuffed out. It was sad, he had a lot of potential, it just was not realized.\"",

Ilhan Omar and \"The Squad\" during a ceremony at Ground Zero on Wednesday. Omar's comments about the attacks, which she described as \"some people did something,\" drew criticism earlier in the year.\n\nHaros Jr., who wore a shirt with Omar's words, spoke during a reading of victims' names and received some applause from the crowd. He stated, \"Today I am here to respond to you exactly who did what to whom... On that day 19 Islamic terrorists, members of Al Qaeda, killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage. Is that clear?\"\n\nHaros Jr. went on to explain that his mother, a tireless receptionist at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, walked into work on a pleasant Tuesday morning and never returned home. He emphasized that the attacks not only took the lives of individuals but also attacked constitutional freedoms and the nation's Judeo-Christian principles.\n\n\"That's what some people did,\" Haros Jr. concluded. \"Got that now? We are here today congresswoman to tell you and The Squad just who did what to whom. Show respect in honoring them, please.\"\n\nOmar tweeted about the attacks on Wednesday, though it was unclear if her tweet was in response to Haros Jr.'s words. In a March 23 fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Omar's controversial comment was made.\n\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley, the other members of \"The Squad,\" defended Omar, with Tlaib stating that Omar's words were taken out of context.\n\nHaros Jr. has previously called out politicians at Ground Zero on the anniversary of the attacks, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen.

    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 163,000 Jobs in July, Unemployment Ticks Up Slightly\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy added 163,000 jobs in July, according to a report by the Labor Department on Friday. The unemployment rate slightly increased from 8.2% in June to 8.3%.\n\nThe high unemployment numbers present a challenge for President Barack Obama as he tries to sell voters on his stewardship of the economy before the November election. Republicans have criticized the Obama administration over the number of Americans out of work.\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney commented on the jobs report, stating, \"Today\u2019s increase in the unemployment rate is a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families. President Obama doesn\u2019t have a plan and believes that the private sector is \u2018doing fine.\u2019 Obviously, that is not the case.\"\n\nThe jobs figure for July was better than most mainstream estimates, with most analysts' predictions hovering around 100,000. On average in 2012, the economy is adding 151,000 jobs per month, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2011, the figure was 153,000.\n\nThe better-than-expected jobs figure gave the White House some breathing room and allowed the president to argue that the employment picture is improving, even if it is not good enough. President Obama stated during a news event at the White House, \"We are not going to get there, we\u2019re not going get to where we need to be if we go back to the policies that helped to create this mess in the first place.\"\n\nJared Bernstein, an economist who worked for the Obama administration earlier in the president\u2019s term, cheered the \"nice pop on payrolls\" but cautioned not to read too much into a single month. \"Keep your powder dry on this one,\" he said in a blog post. \"There are lots of other economic headwinds out there, not least of which is a GDP growth rate below trend, and that\u2019s usually associated with weaker job growth numbers than we saw from the payroll report.\"\n\nInvestors reacted positively to the news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shooting up close to 250 points by the afternoon. Analysts do not expect the economic outlook to change dramatically before the November elections. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, stated, \"The concerns about recession are misplaced.\"",
    " Title: Kasich Disagrees with Democrats' Proposal to Prevent Terrorists on Watch List from Buying Firearms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Republican presidential candidate John Kasich expressed disagreement with the Democratic proposal to add individuals on the terrorism watch list to a \"no gun\" list. Kasich argued that such a move could potentially hinder the monitoring of potential terrorists by alerting them that they are under review.\n\nDuring the interview, CNN host Jake Tapper presented a hypothetical scenario where an individual on the terrorism watch list purchases a machine gun and ammunition, and whether authorities should be allowed to let the transaction proceed. Kasich responded, \"We have to be careful in the way we do this. Everybody wants a slick little answer, a 100 percent answer. We have to figure out what is a common-sense solution.\"\n\nFollowing the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday, President Obama has called for preventing anyone on a \"no fly\" or terrorism watch list from purchasing firearms. In a statement on Saturday, the president said, \"We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but \u2014 at a bare minimum \u2014 we shouldn't be making it so easy for potential terrorists or criminals to get their hands on a gun that they could use against Americans.\"\n\nMany Democrats have supported Mr. Obama's call, while many Republicans have opposed it as an infringement on civil liberties. In the interview, Kasich, the governor of Ohio, agreed that if someone is on a no-fly list, \"we could probably keep them from getting guns.\"\n\nKasich emphasized that the key issue in preventing terrorist acts lies in the intelligence community's ability to monitor online messages. He noted that authorities were unable to read the encrypted messages exchanged among the terrorists involved in last month's Paris attacks that left 130 people dead. \"If the intelligence community can not see the communications, then we're operating in the dark,\" Kasich said.\n\nKasich urged Congress to move on ensuring that authorities have access to such messages to prevent future tragedies.",

He criticized both major party nominees for their controversial statements and proposals on immigration, and expressed opposition to the use of the term \"illegal immigrant,\" describing it as \"incendiary\" and offensive.\n\nJohnson and his running mate support free trade, a position that differentiates them from the two major party nominees. He described his ticket's outlook as \"fiscally conservative and socially inclusive.\"\n\nJohnson assailed Hillary Clinton as an ethically compromised and dishonest statist, and sharply criticized Donald Trump's ideas on immigration and trade. He touted his record of \"cutting the rate of growth of government in half\" as governor as a proud accomplishment, noting that he earned re-election in a blue state even after establishing a reputation as a \"penny pincher.\"\n\nLater this week, we will reveal Gov. Johnson's thoughts on issues such as the Second Amendment, Obamacare, the Iran deal, and the Hobby Lobby decision. Stay tuned.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Justice Brett Kavanaugh Amid Controversial Vote, Leaving Both Parties Critical of Process\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court on Saturday, following a contentious and divisive confirmation process. The vote was 50-48, with all Democrats voting against the nominee.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) expressed hope that the confirmation would mark a turning point, signaling that the acrimony of the past few months was not a successful strategy for Democrats trying to oppose a nominee with strong legal credentials.\n\nFollowing the vote, President Trump signed Justice Kavanaugh's commission, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the oath of office, restoring the court to its full contingent of nine justices.\n\nDemocrats criticized the Republican-led process, citing broken traditions regarding access to documents and the nature of background checks. They also expressed disappointment that the FBI failed to corroborate allegations of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nDemocrats also accused Justice Kavanaugh of lowering the bar with his testy testimony last month, during which he sparred with senators who accused him of lying, attempted rape, using crude language, and drinking as a teenager.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, criticized a perceived liberal public relations machine that they claimed fabricated erroneous stories about Justice Kavanaugh's 12-year record of rulings, concocted conspiracy theories about his nomination, and maltreated Christine Blasey Ford, the first to make misconduct allegations against Justice Kavanaugh privately.\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-RI), a longtime senator, attributed the acrimony to both sides, with Republicans escalating matters. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Judiciary Committee, cautioned Republicans against using the same tactics in future nominations.\n\nHistorically, each new low set by one party has been embraced by the other. Republicans have followed the lead of former Sen. Joseph R. Biden (D-DE) in refusing to consider President Obama's 2016 nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, holding the seat open for the next president to fill.\n\nIn response to partisan filibusters of judicial nominees, both parties have resorted to the \"nuclear option,\" changing the interpretation of the rules to defang the filibuster for most judicial nominees. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) was noncommittal when asked last week whether he would try to reverse that change and restore the filibuster's power for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats regain control of the Senate.\n\nDespite the contentious nature of the confirmation process, the Senate managed to pass two massive spending bills, clear an anti-opioid package, and make progress on other bipartisan priorities during the Kavanaugh fight. The relationships built up over decades among senators, even amid the strife, remain strong, as evidenced by the exchange of handshakes and chuckles between Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-IL) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) shortly after the latter was criticized by the former for his handling of the Kavanaugh nomination.",
    " Title: \"Rumors of Taxpayer-Funded Health Insurance Bailout Under ObamaCare Persist Amidst Rising Costs and Political Manipulation\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, continue to rise, there is growing urgency for Congress to prevent the possibility of taxpayer-funded bailouts of health insurance companies. This week, a majority of insurers offering health plans in Florida announced premium increases ranging from 11 to 23 percent. If patients choose to drop their coverage due to these increases, health insurers will need to find alternative means to cover the losses.\n\nSection 1342 of the ObamaCare law, also known as \"risk corridors,\" was established to address such situations. This provision allows taxpayers to cover the losses of health insurance companies whose plans underperform under ObamaCare. In November 2014, legislation was introduced to repeal this section and protect taxpayers from being forced to cover insurers' ObamaCare losses.\n\nDespite the Obama administration's initial announcement that it had no intention of operating this bailout program at a net cost to the American people, health insurers and their lobbyists have reportedly pressured the administration to reconsider. In response, new legislation was introduced to codify the administration's promise and prohibit the use of taxpayer funds for this purpose. However, this legislation has not progressed in the Democrat-controlled Senate, and the White House has shown no interest in supporting it.\n\nRecent investigations by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Darrell Issa, have revealed that health insurers widely expect to receive funds from the bailout program. One large health insurer has even filed financial statements claiming they expect part of their revenue to come from American taxpayers via the ObamaCare bailout \"fund.\"\n\nTo circumvent Congress' power of the purse, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has reportedly found a way to use general funds available through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to pay off health insurers, effectively bypassing Congress and using taxpayer funds for the bailout.\n\nWith ObamaCare's costs projected to exceed $2 trillion over the next decade, its impact on jobs and work hours continuing, and the prospect of a taxpayer-funded bailout of health insurers still alive, it is clear that the law has failed. The author argues that it is time to repeal and replace ObamaCare, but at the very least, the law should be amended to ensure that health insurers will not be bailed out by taxpayers due to the underperformance of ObamaCare.",

Page, 39, stated that she could no longer remain silent in the face of the president's repeated attacks, particularly a \"demeaning fake orgasm\" incident at an Oct. 11 rally in Minneapolis.\n\n\"I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,\" she said. \"It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.\"\n\nPage, who left the FBI in May 2018, described the feeling of being attacked by Trump as \"like being punched in the gut.\" She added, \"It's sickening. The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world. He's demeaning me and my career.\"\n\nTrump last tweeted about Page on Nov. 15, following the conviction of his longtime associate Roger Stone. In the tweet, Trump criticized the fact that Stone was headed to jail while Page, Strzok, and others, including his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton, went free.\n\nInvestigations have not shown Page, Strzok, Clinton, or any of the others accused by Trump to be guilty of any criminal wrongdoing. In a June 2018 report, the Justice Department inspector general's office stated that it was \"deeply troubled\" by the anti-Trump texts between Page and Strzok but \"did not find evidence to connect the political views expressed in these messages to the specific investigative decisions\" they made in the investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nA new report from the Justice Department inspector general on the origin of the investigations into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election is scheduled for release on Dec. 9. Page can expect her name to appear in that report as well.\n\nPage stated that even if the inspector general's report clears her of any wrongdoing, she does not expect her vilification among Trump's supporters to end. \"While it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don\u2019t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people,\" she told The Daily Beast. \"The president has a very loud megaphone.\"\n\nIn their texts, Page and Strzok made several comments that were disparaging of Trump and supportive of Clinton. In the text exchange most often cited as evidence of their bias against Trump, Page asks Strzok to assure her that Trump is \"not ever going to become president, right?\"\n\nPage stated that she had been inaccurately depicted by a \"cherry-picked selection of my texts\" and did not remember the messages about Trump when she first learned her texts were being investigated.\n\nSeveral Trump supporters were appalled by the interview, and they decried what they saw as Page's attempt to paint herself as a victim. \"Let me get this straight,\" tweeted Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \"Page and Strzok sent texts about an 'insurance policy' and how they'll'stop Trump' while part of the FBI spying on Trump campaign. Now Lisa Page is blaming the President. 1 week before Horowitz\u2019s FISA report.\"\n\nPage's marriage survived, but she compared the effect of the experience to post-traumatic stress disorder, stating it is worse \"because it's not over.

It just keeps happening.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t ever know when the president\u2019s going to attack next,\" she said. \"And when it happens, it can still sort of upend my day.

The allegations, which were first reported by The Washington Post, involve Moore's inappropriate behavior towards several women decades ago, including sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979.\n\nIn a statement issued through Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump stated that he believes \"we can not allow a mere allegation \u2014 in this case, one from many years ago \u2014 to destroy a person's life.\" However, the statement also noted that if the allegations are true, \"Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\"\n\nMoore, a former Alabama Supreme Court justice, defeated Trump's preferred candidate, Sen. Luther Strange, in the Republican primary to replace former Sen. Jeff Sessions, who became Trump's attorney general. The allegations against Moore have caused a national controversy, with several prominent Republicans, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, withdrawing their support.\n\nWhen asked about the specific allegations against Moore during his Asia trip, Trump insisted that he has been too preoccupied with world affairs to pay much attention to the matter. \"I'd have to look at it and I'd have to see,\" Trump said. \"Because, again, I'm dealing with the president of China, the president of Russia. I'm dealing with the folks over here,\" he added, referring to his meetings with world leaders.\n\nThe allegations against Moore have caused a significant stir in the United States, with some calling for Moore to drop out of the Alabama Senate race. Moore, for his part, has given vague denials of the allegations, stating, \"I don't remember anything like that\" and \"I don't remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Moore's candidacy is the latest in a series of sexual misconduct allegations that have rocked the political landscape in the United States in recent months. The allegations against Moore come as the #MeToo movement continues to gain momentum, with numerous high-profile figures in politics, entertainment, and media facing accusations of sexual misconduct.",
    " Title: Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Infections and Deaths in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nA study by \u2588\u2588\u2588 has revealed significant racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths across the United States. In 28 states and the District of Columbia, preliminary data analysis shows that Black people have disproportionately contracted and died from the coronavirus.\n\nIn 20 of the 28 states plus DC for which a usable racial breakdown of infection data was provided, Black people make up a larger share of coronavirus infections than they do of the general population. Similarly, in 18 of the 23 states plus DC for which a usable racial breakdown of fatality data was provided, Black people make up a disproportionately large share of coronavirus fatalities.\n\nFor instance, in Michigan, Black people are 14 percent of the state's population but 33 percent of its coronavirus cases and 40 percent of its deaths. In Wisconsin, Black people are six percent of the state's population but 25 percent of its coronavirus cases and 39 percent of its deaths.\n\nData for Latinx populations is scarce, but what is available shows that Latinx people are dying at much higher rates in New York City relative to their share of the population, but not in any of the places that provided relevant breakdowns.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released racial data on 10 states. Civil rights groups, medical professionals, and lawmakers have pressured the CDC to release data on who is infected and who dies from the coronavirus by race and ethnicity.\n\nThomas LaVeist, dean of the Tulane School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine, attributes the racial disparities to various factors, including Black Americans' higher likelihood of working essential jobs, living in densely populated, historically segregated cities, and suffering disproportionately from underlying health conditions.\n\nClyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, calls this a \"moment of ethical reckoning\" and points out that infection rates were three times higher in counties with mostly Black people than in predominantly white counties. Predominantly Black counties saw a sixfold higher death rate than mostly white counties.\n\nYancy writes, \"A 6-fold increase in the rate of death for African Americans due to a now ubiquitous virus should be deemed unconscionable.\" He concludes, \"The scourge of COVID-19 will end, but health care disparities will persist.\"",
    " Title: Call for Trump's Resignation Amidst Coronavirus Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, with just over 4% of the world's population, has accounted for about one-third of all global coronavirus cases and one-quarter of the fatalities, as of Friday. This disproportionate impact can be attributed, in large part, to the actions and statements of President Donald Trump.\n\nOne of the president's most controversial suggestions has been the use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, as a potential treatment for the coronavirus. Trump publicly endorsed the drug, stating, \"What do you have to lose?\" However, a new study of Veterans Health Administration patients has concluded that COVID-19 patients who take hydroxychloroquine are more likely to die than those who do not.\n\nIn addition, Trump suggested on Thursday that ultraviolet rays and cleaning disinfectants, when injected into the body, could be potential treatments for coronavirus. These comments prompted public health experts and companies like Lysol to remind Americans that they should not ingest cleaning products.\n\nThe Trump administration has also reportedly forced out the official in charge of the federal agency responsible for developing a vaccine for the coronavirus after he raised concerns about money being directed toward hydroxychloroquine.\n\nTrump's obsession with reopening the economy has also been a catalyst for governors in red state America to weaken social distancing regulations. His calls for the end of social distancing orders have directly contradicted the Trump White House's own guidance.\n\nTrump's credibility has been significantly damaged, with less than a quarter of voters putting a high level of trust in what he is saying about COVID-19. The president's actions and words have done more harm than good, leading to calls for his resignation from editorial boards and politicians, both Democratic and Republican.\n\nThe call for Trump's resignation is not a partisan exercise, but a common-sense response to a president who is making the crisis worse by remaining in office. The president's detachment from reality, indifference to the suffering around us, and political self-aggrandizement have eroded the public trust and undermined the nation's response to the coronavirus crisis.",
    " Title: Saudi Military Trainee's Alleged Al-Qaeda Connection in Pensacola Shooting Revealed\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Saudi military trainee who carried out a terror attack at a military base in Pensacola, Florida, last year, killing three US sailors and wounding several others, had a long-standing association with al-Qaeda, according to the Justice Department and the FBI. The connection was uncovered after the FBI managed to break through the encryption on the attacker's iPhones.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday, Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray announced that the evidence from the attacker's devices showed that the Pensacola attack was the culmination of years of planning and preparation by a longtime associate of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the deadliest branches of the terror group.\n\nMohammed Alshamrani, a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force who was training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, was killed by law enforcement during the attack. The officials stopped short of saying that Alshamrani had been directed by the terror group, but said his ties to AQAP began as far back as 2015 and were \"significant.\"\n\nThe connection between the group and the attack marked a major development in the US fight against terrorism. Since 9/11, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully directed a deadly attack in the US, according to New America, a think tank.\n\nThe officials also used the opportunity to criticize Apple for refusing to help investigators break into the devices. FBI Director Wray said that the FBI received \"effectively no help\" from Apple in bypassing the phones, and that third-party technology firms were also unable to help investigators.\n\nApple said in a statement Monday that the company does not believe in creating special access to its devices for the government because of security concerns. \"It is because we take our responsibility to national security so seriously that we do not believe in the creation of a backdoor \u2014 one which will make every device vulnerable to bad actors who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers,\" the company said.\n\nThe Justice Department has previously called the attack an act of terrorism motivated by \"jihadist ideology.\" Alshamrani had made anti-American, anti-Israel, and jihadi posts on social media, including one on the September 11 anniversary, that stated \"the countdown has begun,\" and another two hours before the attack that referenced the words of an al-Qaeda cleric.\n\nDuring a 15-minute shooting spree, Alshamrani shot at a photo of President Donald Trump as well as a former president. He made statements during the attack that were critical of American servicemen overseas, the FBI has said.\n\nAQAP had claimed responsibility for the Pensacola attack and said it was in touch with Alshamrani. In February, the White House announced that Qassim al-Rimi, the leader of the group, had been killed in an airstrike in Yemen.\n\nNo other co-conspirators have been charged in the shooting, and Barr said earlier this year that investigators did not find evidence that any of the shooter's friends or fellow trainees from Saudi Arabia had advance knowledge that he was going to attack the base.\n\nOn Monday, Barr said the Saudi government continued to fully cooperate with the investigation, and the Saudi Embassy in Washington said in a statement Monday evening they are providing \"full support to our American counterparts.\"\n\nInvestigators had initially been unable to retrieve data stored on two iPhones belonging to the shooter, and they cited that hurdle in trying to complete their investigation of the attacker's ideology and radicalization. Justice Department and FBI officials said Apple had helped provide access to iCloud and other data from the shooter's devices, but breaking the phones' encryption was key to retrieving more of Alshamrani's communications before the attack.",
    " Title: Congressional Resolution on Syria: Limited Authorization for Use of Force Proposed\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, advocating for a resolution authorizing the use of force against Syria in response to the alleged chemical weapons attack by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The administration is seeking congressional approval for retaliatory strikes, with the threat of further chemical weapons use by Assad's regime and potential nuclear weapon use by North Korea or Iran cited as potential consequences of a negative vote.\n\nThe committee agreed on a resolution late Tuesday that would prohibit \"combat\" troops from being deployed to Syria and allow the president to conduct strikes for a maximum of 90 days. The resolution is set for a committee vote on Wednesday. The White House is hoping the resolution will build momentum for eventual approval by both chambers of Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, emerged from a meeting with President Obama on Tuesday, stating he will vote to authorize an attack on Syria. However, the support of Mr. Boehner, and the administration's overall chances of winning over undecided lawmakers, is questionable, as more House members are adding their names to the list of those opposed to the authority President Obama is seeking.\n\nThe resolution, as released by senators, restricts the scope of action in Syria and presses the administration to consider arming moderate rebels fighting to overthrow Mr. Assad. The version of the resolution was negotiated by Sen. Bob Corker, the key Republican in the negotiations, and was released hours after Mr. Kerry and the top two Defense Department officials testified to the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nIn his testimony, Mr. Kerry stated there is no doubt that troops loyal to Mr. Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in rebel-held territory on Aug. 21, and the only question now is whether the U.S. will enforce President Obama's and the world's \"red line.\" Mr. Kerry compared those who would vote against action to the case of the MS St. Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees from Germany that was turned away from Cuba, the U.S., and Canada in 1939, and had to return to Europe, where many of its passengers eventually died in Nazi camps.\n\nThe claims made by Mr. Kerry were met with skepticism among some lawmakers, who expressed concerns about limited U.S. strikes leading to a regional escalation. The majority of the 18-member committee appeared to be leaning in favor of action, heeding the call of Senate leaders who are pushing for lawmakers to pass a resolution that would give a stamp of approval for Mr. Obama to act.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, emerged from a meeting with Mr. Obama at the White House to say they will vote to authorize force. However, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner stated it will be up to Mr. Obama to find the votes, and it's an \"uphill\" climb for the administration. The latest polling shows the American public is opposed to retaliatory strikes, with 59% of respondents rejecting them, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll.\n\nMr. Kerry and his fellow panel members are set to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, while the Senate committee will hold a closed-door session to hear classified details about U.S. plans and the intelligence supporting claims that chemical weapons were used. The Senate committee hearing on Tuesday was interrupted several times by vocal female protesters calling for Congress to reject any military action. Mr. Kerry, who made a name in national politics by protesting the Vietnam War, in which he served, said he sympathized with the demonstrating women and that it represented the importance for Congress to have a debate.\n\nAlthough some analysts still question whether the Syrian regime used chemical weapons, most members of Congress seemed ready to accept the administration's case that such weapons were used on Aug. 21 and that forces loyal to Mr. Assad were responsible for the attack. \"In my view, there is a preponderance of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,\" said Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Kerry punctuated that point, saying the Obama administration has learned the lessons of faulty intelligence from the experience in Iraq and has repeatedly scrubbed its intelligence to make sure it's correct.",
    " Title: White House Warns of Severe Consequences of Sequestration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of an impending blizzard in New England, the White House has taken a metaphorical approach to warn of another kind of storm: the potential effects of sequestration, the automatic, across-the-board cuts to defense and domestic spending set to take effect on March 1 unless Congress and President Obama agree on an alternative plan.\n\nDuring a briefing with reporters, White House officials used a series of adjectives to describe the anticipated impacts: \"large and arbitrary,\" \"severe,\" \"significant and harmful,\" \"very significant,\" \"blunt,\" \"mindless,\" and \"extraordinarily troublesome.\"\n\nThe officials outlined specific consequences that could result from the sequestration, including:\n- 70,000 young children being removed from Head Start early education programs\n- Hundreds of federal prosecutors being furloughed\n- Reduced food safety inspections\n- 600,000 women and children losing nutritional benefits\n- A decrease of approximately $500 million in small-business loans\n\nDanny Werfel, the federal controller of the Office of Management and Budget, stated, \"The cuts would cause very significant disruptions that would be felt far and wide across the country. This is just the tip of the iceberg. We can\u2019t plan our way out of these consequences or take steps to soften the blow.\"\n\nThe briefing was the latest effort by the Obama administration to assign blame for the consequences of the automatic cuts, should they occur. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, attempted to deflect this blame, noting that the House has already proposed alternative spending cuts to avoid the automatic ones.\n\nIn a statement emailed to reporters, Mr. Buck said, \"The president is out of excuses. We\u2019re glad they\u2019re laying out the devastating consequences of the president\u2019s sequester, but the question remains: what are they willing to do to prevent it?\"\n\nA spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky stated on Twitter after the White House briefing, \"Words not used at WH briefing to describe sequestered budget cuts: 'Here\u2019s our plan.'\"\n\nAt the White House, economic officials lamented the lack of flexibility in the sequestration law, which they noted was intentional. \"It was intended to drive Democrats and Republicans in Congress to compromise,\" Mr. Werfel said. \"It does not represent a responsible way to achieve deficit reduction.\"\n\nWhite House officials are quick to point out that Republicans in the House initially embraced the idea of the automatic cuts as a means to enforce deficit discipline. They note that 174 House Republicans, including Speaker Boehner, voted for sequestration, with Mr. Boehner proclaiming himself pleased when it passed.\n\nPress Secretary Jay Carney stated that the notion that the automatic cuts were solely the president's idea is a \"fanciful confection\" invented by Republicans. However, none of Mr. Obama's aides were willing to admit that the president regretted signing the law that put the sequestration plan into effect. Mr. Carney explained that because of Republican opposition to tax increases, the automatic cuts became the only way to avoid a default on the national debt in the summer of 2011.\n\n\"He could not let the country default for the first time, thus the sequester,\" Mr. Carney said. \"The whole point in its design was that it would never come to pass.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Attorneys Appointed to Investigate Classified Information Leaks\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. appointed Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, and Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland, to lead separate investigations into unauthorized leaks of classified information. The two prosecutors will work with the FBI and lead criminal investigations into the leaks, with full authorization to prosecute criminal violations as a result of their investigation.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Holder said, \"The unauthorized disclosure of classified information can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated.\" He added that the Justice Department takes such cases seriously and will do so in these cases as well.\n\nPresident Obama defended himself from criticism for the leaks, denying that they were intentional or orchestrated to boost his foreign policy bona fides ahead of the November election. Critics, led by Sen. John McCain, have called the leaks a serious security breach and unprecedented in recent memory.\n\nMr. Obama pledged to launch a thorough investigation into the matter, stating that his administration has \"zero tolerance\" for such leaks. He also emphasized that his administration will conduct thorough investigations, as they have in the past, and that those who leak information will face consequences, including criminal charges in some cases.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Mr. Holder announced the appointment of the two U.S. attorneys, stating, \"We have mechanisms in place where if we can root out folks who have leaked, they will suffer consequences.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Presidency: A Divisive Battlefield or Uniter of Parties?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, President Donald Trump has been referred to as a \"Great Uniter\" by some, due to his ability to rally support within the Republican Party following his acquittal in the Senate and his State of the Union address. According to a Gallup Poll, 94% of Republicans approve of his handling of his presidency, a level of support that is comparable only to the first months of the 1991 Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush and the first months of the 2003 Iraq War under President George W. Bush.\n\nHowever, Trump's presidency has not only united the Republican Party but also divided the Democratic Party. Every Democrat but three in the House voted to impeach and remove him, and every Democrat in the Senate voted to convict and prevent his ever running again. The issue of evicting Trump from the Oval Office seems to be a significant concern for Democrats, more so than getting U.S. troops out of the Middle East wars.\n\nThe ideological differences between Trump and the Democratic Party are stark. Trump's tax cuts for corporations and individuals and deregulation policies contrast with the Democratic Party's support for nationalized health care and abolition of private health insurance. The Democrats' unanimous support for \"reproductive rights\" is in conflict with Trump's pledge to nominate justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe issue of immigration also divides the two parties. Democrats support tearing down Trump's wall, ending deportations, extending welfare benefits to border-crossers, and granting sanctuary from border security agents for criminals residing in the U.S. illegally. The changing demographics of the U.S., with Americans of European descent expected to be less than half of the population in 20 years, is celebrated by Democrats, while Republicans, who predominantly vote for the GOP, provide 85-90% of all Republican votes in presidential elections.\n\nThe Democratic Party has become more politically correct, with candidates being criticized for their past positions. For instance, former Vice President Joe Biden has been attacked for his opposition to the forced busing of children from neighborhood schools into inner-city schools, his friendship with Southern senators, and his role in the Clarence Thomas hearings. He has also been criticized for authorizing the 2003 war in Iraq.\n\nThe question remains as to whether Trump's presidency is the cause of the uncivil war in America or if it is merely the battlefield upon which America's cultural and political war is currently engaged. Some argue that Trump's success has maddened Democrats into manifesting who they are and what they believe, while others contend that the parties were divided long before Trump's presidency and will remain so long after he departs.\n\nPatrick Buchanan, an adviser to three presidents, two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and the nominee for the Reform Party in 2000, has suggested that the irrationality and irresponsibility taking on epidemic proportions inside the Democratic Party may be a result of Trump's success. However, others argue that Trump's presidency has simply revealed who the Democrats are and what they believe, and what may yet prevent them from being taken seriously as a party that can lead the nation.",
    " Title: President Trump Announces Plans for a \"Space Force\" as Sixth Branch of U.S. Armed Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a meeting of the National Space Council on Monday, President Donald Trump announced plans to establish a new military branch, the \"space force,\" which would become the sixth branch of the U.S. armed forces. The president made the announcement at a meeting in Washington D.C., stating, \"We are going to have a space force. An Air Force and a Space Force. Separate, but equal.\"\n\nTrump's proposal for a \"space force\" is not a new idea; he previously mentioned the concept in May during a ceremony at the White House. The president did not provide details about the military role of the \"space force\" or who would command it, but he framed space as a national security issue, stating, \"I do not want China and Russia and other countries leading us.\"\n\nPentagon spokeswoman Dana White responded, \"We understand the President's guidance. Our Policy Board will begin working on this issue, which has implications for intelligence operations for the Air Force, Army, Marines, and Navy. Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.\"\n\nThe president also called for a long-term build-up in the U.S.'s presence in space, expressed support for the nascent commercial space travel industry, and signed a directive to manage space traffic. The directive aims to provide a safe and secure environment in orbit as satellite traffic increases and sets up new guidelines for satellite design and operation to avoid collisions and spacecraft breakups.\n\nBefore discussing the space program, President Trump weighed in on the ongoing immigration crisis, blasting the U.S.'s current immigration laws and stating, \"The United States will not be a migrant holding facility. We cannot allow that to happen in the U.S. Not on my watch. We want safety and we want security.\" Trump added, \"If the Democrats would sit down and stop obstructing, we could have something quickly.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents has come under increasing scrutiny from both sides of the aisle. The policy, which has resulted in nearly 2,000 minors being separated from their families over six weeks, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and even a number of influential Republicans, including former first lady Laura Bush, who called the policy \"cruel\" and \"immoral\" in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.",
    " Title: Gallup and Rasmussen Polls Show Tight Presidential Race Between Obama and Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Gallup and Rasmussen daily presidential trackers have reported a tight race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, with a single statistically insignificant point separating the two candidates. The Rasmussen tracker, which polls likely voters on a three-day cycle, has shown a reversal from the post-Democratic National Convention (DNC) bounce, while Gallup, which surveys registered voters over a seven-day cycle, has also reported a narrowing of the gap.\n\nIn the aftermath of the DNC, Obama led by as many as five points in Rasmussen and seven points in Gallup, largely due to an effective speech from former President Bill Clinton. However, as of the latest polls, Romney leads Obama by two points in the Rasmussen poll, while Obama holds a single-point edge in the Gallup poll.\n\nIn the battleground states, Romney has virtually tied with Obama among registered voters in New Hampshire. The sample of respondents in this poll appears slightly favorable to the Republican Party, although undeclared voters make up a significant portion of the pool. The Romney campaign believes Colorado is a pure toss-up at this point, and Romney has edged into the lead in this state according to the latest polls.\n\nIn Virginia, a Washington Post poll indicates Obama is leading Romney by eight points, relying on a D+9 sample, three points higher than the 2008 partisan split. This contrasts with Rasmussen's recent poll, which showed the Virginia race at 49-48 in Obama's favor, and other polls that place the race somewhere in between. Politico's Jonathan Martin has expressed skepticism about the Washington Post poll's sample.",
    " Title: Political Operative Charged with Misdemeanor Battery in Nevada After Alleged Confrontation at GOP Campaign Event\n\nArticle:\n\nA political operative from Virginia, Wilfred Michael Stark, has been charged with misdemeanor battery in Nevada following an incident at a GOP campaign event. Stark, 50, of Falls Church, Virginia, was arrested Tuesday evening and released from the Las Vegas city jail on $1,140 bail on Wednesday, according to Jace Radke, a city spokesman. The court date for Stark is currently unavailable.\n\nThe incident occurred at a Las Vegas community center, where Stark allegedly pushed into the event and grabbed the manager of state Attorney General Adam Laxalt's gubernatorial campaign, according to witnesses. Stark told the officer who took him into custody that he was attacked \"because he was a Democrat in a room full of Republicans,\" according to the arrest report.\n\nWitnesses provided statements saying Stark declared several times, \"I do this for a living.\" The Laxalt campaign spokesman, Parker Briden, linked Stark with American Bridge 21st Century, a group that supports Democratic candidates and is committed to holding Republicans accountable. An American Bridge official did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages.\n\nStark has a history of confronting Republican political figures. In March, he was arrested in Washington, D.C., on a simple assault charge for allegedly using his body to push a top aide to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke outside a congressional hearing. American Bridge, the organization that spoke on behalf of Stark, \"adamantly\" denied the allegations at that time.\n\nStark was also arrested a year ago in suburban Virginia and charged with creating a disturbance while videotaping a parade appearance by GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie for ShareBlue Media, an American Bridge affiliate. He was convicted of disorderly conduct, according to a report in the Fairfax County Times.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Laxalt campaign chief Kristin Davison made a citizen's arrest after she and witnesses said Stark pushed into a room and grabbed her arm hard enough to leave red marks. \"Mike Stark aggressively interrupted our conversation, both by loudly yelling and physically shoving a camera and his body at the attorney general and me,\" Davison's signed police complaint said. \"I asked him to back away and he did not.\"\n\nDemocratic candidate Steve Sisolak's campaign and state Democratic party officials denied any connection to Stark. \"No one should ever feel unsafe at a political event,\" Sisolak spokeswoman Christina Amestoy said in a statement. \"We strongly condemn this violence.\"",
    " Title: Mini-Trade Deal with China Falls Short of Comprehensive Goals, Economists Say\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced last week that the United States and China had reached a significant trade deal, but a closer look reveals that the agreement is more of a tentative proposal rather than a comprehensive deal. The deal, according to Trump, is one of the biggest in a long time, but economists argue that it falls short of the president's initial promises and may reinforce China's protectionist and authoritarian economic policies.\n\nThe deal does not compel the Chinese government to relinquish its grip on its economy, and it remains unclear whether China will stop asking foreign companies to hand over trade secrets. China will likely continue to use state-owned enterprises to artificially direct resources toward favored industries, a practice that the deal may actually reinforce.\n\nOne of the most noticeable failures of the deal is the lack of a commitment from China to abandon its protectionist policies. The deal requires China to purchase $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural products annually, a concession China already agreed to more than two years ago. This increase in agricultural purchases is not a victory, but rather a concession that pursues the very top-down, government-directed policy that Trump claimed he wanted to change.\n\nThe deal's focus on exports is also problematic. Economists argue that exports are costs, not benefits, and that the goal of trade is to import goods and services in exchange for what is exported. George Mason University's Donald Boudreaux explains, \"What is true at the level of the household is here true at the level of the national economy: the goods and services that Americans export to foreigners are the costs that we willingly incur in order to be able to import into our country the goods and services that we receive from foreigners in exchange.\"\n\nThe trade war, which has been marked by tariffs, manufacturing slowdowns, and rampant uncertainty, has yielded few concessions from China. The United States will continue to impose tariffs on roughly $360 billion worth of Chinese imports, causing continued disruption to the supply chain at the expense of American companies and consumers.\n\nMoreover, the opportunity cost of the Trump strategy is often overlooked. Daniel Mitchell of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity argues, \"Just imagine, by contrast, where we would be if Trump had joined with our allies and used the World Trade Organization to go after China's mercantilist policies. We'd be in much better shape today.\" The reduction in tariffs China agreed to for many other countries, while increasing tariffs on American exports, and the numerous trade deals our trading partners have implemented since the beginning of this trade war, further highlight the opportunity cost of the Trump strategy.\n\nIn light of these factors, it is difficult to view the trade war, even one that ends with this mini-deal, as a win for the United States.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Increase in Number of Underinsured Individuals Due to High Deductibles\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Commonwealth Fund has found that approximately one-quarter of individuals with health insurance are considered underinsured due to high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. The 2014 national health insurance survey estimates that 31 million insured people are not sufficiently protected against high healthcare costs, a figure that has doubled since 2003, according to The Hill.\n\nThe report indicates that rising deductibles is the primary issue for those considered underinsured, even with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The report warns that the steady growth in the prevalence and size of deductibles could lead to an increase in underinsurance in the future, as stated by The Hill.\n\nThe survey also found that people who purchase the lowest quality health coverage are less likely to seek medical care when sick or injured due to fear of high out-of-pocket costs. Sara Collins, the study's lead author, told reporters that \"people who have high deductibles do tend to skimp on healthcare\" (The Hill).\n\nAccording to the report, half of underinsured adults and 41 percent of privately insured adults with deductibles of at least $1,000 had medical bills totaling $4,000 or more. The report calls into question the Obama administration's promise that millions of people would gain access to affordable healthcare under Obamacare. However, the report does not account for the people who were uninsured before 2014, as stated by Collins (The Hill).\n\n\"We're unable to separately assess the effects of the law with these data,\" Collins said (The Hill). \"What we're seeing, though, in the data is ever-growing deductibles.\"\n\nDespite the increase in deductibles, healthcare costs overall have not risen as of late, something which the Obama administration has taken partial credit for, according to The Hill. Specifically, the rate of those underinsured has flattened over the last several years, with the biggest increases in the underinsured population occurring between 2003 and 2010.\n\nThe study found that those most likely to be underinsured are employed by small businesses, as reported by The Hill.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Staff Wage Gap Raises Questions About Gender Equality Advocates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a report by the Washington Free Beacon has revealed that during her tenure in the U.S. Senate, Hillary Clinton paid women on her staff only 72 cents for every dollar paid to men. This revelation, coming from a figure who has been a vocal advocate for gender equality, has sparked questions about the commitment of high-profile feminists and women's organizations to their cause.\n\nAccording to the analysis of data compiled from official Senate expenditure reports, the median annual salary for a woman working in Clinton's office was $15,708.38 less than the median salary for a man during those years. This wage gap, a stark contrast to Clinton's public stance on gender equality, has raised eyebrows, particularly given her past statements on the issue.\n\nIn 2014, Clinton tweeted, \"More work to do. # EqualPay # NoCeilings,\" referring to the persistent wage gap between men and women. However, the \"ceilings\" she spoke of seem to have been present within her own office.\n\nIn June, the Washington Free Beacon also reported on a scandal from the 1980s involving Clinton, where she defended a man who was accused of raping an underage girl, a story that became known as The Hillary Tapes. Despite this, groups like Planned Parenthood and EMILY's List continue to honor Clinton's \"efforts\" on behalf of women.\n\nAs for the A-list celebrities who cheered for wage equality at the Oscars, their response to the pay gap revelations remains to be seen. It remains unclear whether Clinton will face criticism from these famous feminists and popular women's rights groups, or if they will continue to focus their ire on what they perceive as the \"real threat\" \u2013 the suffocating patriarchy.\n\nThe answer to whether Clinton will face backlash from these groups is yet to be determined, but the wage gap revelation has certainly added a new layer of complexity to the ongoing conversation about gender equality.",
    " Title: India's Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, Sparks Controversy with \"Deradicalization\" Comments\n\nArticle:\n\nIndia's newly appointed Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, has stirred controversy with his recent comments suggesting the existence of \"deradicalization\" camps in India, drawing comparisons with the internment of Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province.\n\nDuring a media address in New Delhi last week, Rawat stated, \"Like what we are seeing in Kashmir... we saw radicalization happening. There are people who have completely been radicalized. These people need to be taken out separately, possibly taken into some deradicalization camps. We have deradicalization camps going on in our country.\"\n\nRawat's comments have sparked fear among Kashmiris, who claim that India is seeking to emulate China's actions in Xinjiang. Human rights groups estimate that over a million Uighurs have been detained in internment camps in Xinjiang, which Beijing refers to as \"re-education camps\" to eradicate alleged religious \"extremism.\"\n\nHowever, Kashmiri political analyst Zafar Chowdhary disputes the notion of radicalization in Kashmir. \"I don't see this problem in Kashmir with the prism of radicalization,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Noor Ahmad Baba, a political analyst based in Srinagar, the main city in the Muslim-majority region under lockdown for the past five months, echoed similar sentiments. \"India should not follow China because India has a claim to constituent democracy,\" Baba said.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior police official in Kashmir confirmed Rawat's claims, stating that a \"deradicalization\" center in Kashmir is under consideration. \"The Jammu and Kashmir police department has conceptualized one de-radicalization center for which funds have been granted by the Ministry of Home Affairs, but it is yet to be established,\" the official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the media.\n\nKashmir's police chief, Dilbagh Singh, also endorsed the idea of \"deradicalization\" centers in Kashmir. \"If any such facility comes up in Kashmir, that will be a good sign. It'll definitely help people, especially those who have gone astray,\" Singh said.\n\nHowever, Zafar Chowdhary disagreed with the \"radicalization theory about Kashmir.\" \"I don't see this problem in Kashmir with the prism of radicalization,\" he said.\n\nAjai Sahni, founding member and executive director of the Institute of Conflict Management in New Delhi, expressed concern over Rawat's political statements, stating, \"It is the most unfortunate thing that a man of his stature is lowering the stature of the Indian army by making such political statements.\"\n\nRetired Air Vice Marshal Kapil Kak, who has been critical of the Indian government's move to abrogate Article 370 in Kashmir, voiced his reservations against sending children to \"deradicalization\" camps. \"There is no denying that some extremists do try to influence people in Kashmir, but it is not politically correct to raise this issue to otherwise Kashmiris. Kids being put up in deradicalization camps is a horrendous proposition,\" Kak said.\n\nKak also expressed concerns over the increasing \"politicization of military and militarization of politics,\" which, according to him, does not bode well for India's democracy.\n\nGazala Wahab, executive editor of Force, India's leading magazine on national security, suggested that the politicization of the Indian army has been a \"slow and insidious process.\" \"Of course, this is extremely worrisome. A politicized military is the complete negation of democracy. In a multi-cultural, multi-religious country like India, a partisan military will be disastrous,\" Wahab said.",
    " Title: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Defends ACA Amidst Bipartisan Vote on Healthcare Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has expressed her continued support for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, following a bipartisan vote on a bill that allows insurers to offer health plans that do not comply with federal laws.\n\nOn NBC's Meet the Press, Pelosi stated, \"I have full confidence, as do my members, however they voted on this. This is political; they respond politically.\" She added that the number of Democrats supporting the ACA has remained relatively stable over the past few months, with 30 Democrats voting with Republicans on other House bills not endorsed by the president or Pelosi.\n\nThe bill in question, which allows insurers to keep health plans that do not meet federal laws, is unlikely to progress to a Senate vote. However, Pelosi suggested that House Democrats could use the vote to demonstrate their opposition to a law that may be unpopular in their districts.\n\nPelosi acknowledged the challenges faced by the federal health exchange website, HealthCare.gov, but emphasized that Democrats remain committed to the ACA. \"I will tell you this: Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act,\" she said.\n\nInstead of focusing on the issues with the law, such as the malfunctioning website and the president's broken promise to allow insurers to offer customers their old plans, Pelosi chose to focus on positive developments. She highlighted states with successful state-run health exchanges, such as California and Kentucky, which are enrolling customers and praising the affordability of the plans.\n\nFor instance, California announced on Friday that it would soon offer online enrollment for the Small Business Health Options Program for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. As of November 12, approximately 60,000 people had selected insurance plans through the state's exchange.\n\nPelosi's comments come as Democrats prepare for re-election after a rocky start to the federal health exchange. The exact future of the ACA remains uncertain, but Pelosi's statements indicate a determination to maintain support for the law amidst ongoing challenges and political divisions.",
    " Title: Michigan Attorney General Files Emergency Motion to Stop Jill Stein's Recount Request\n\nArticle:\n\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, has filed an emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court to stop the recount request by Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in the 2016 presidential election. The motion aims to bypass the Court of Appeals to ensure a timely process.\n\nIn a statement, Schuette's office explained that Michigan voters rejected Stein's candidacy by a significant margin, but her refusal to accept the state-verified result poses an expensive and risky threat to taxpayers and abuses the intent of Michigan law. The motion requests the court to end the recount that Stein is pursuing in violation of Michigan laws that protect the integrity of elections.\n\nStein filed a request last week for a recount of Michigan's vote in the 2016 election after a narrow margin made the state the last to be called. President-elect Donald Trump won Michigan's 16 electoral votes by a margin of 0.2 percentage points, or just under 10,000 votes out of over 5.5 million cast.\n\nStein is also fighting efforts to halt the recount in Wisconsin, where Trump supporters have also tried to stop the recount in progress. In a statement, Stein's attorney, Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, said, \"The Jill Stein Campaign plans to intervene and join the Wisconsin Elections Commission in defending the recount. Citizens in Wisconsin and across the country have made it clear that they want a recount and deserve to see this process through to ensure integrity in the vote.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Stein defended her decision to request a recount in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania \u2013 three traditionally blue swing states that proved critical to Trump's upset victory. Stein argued that predictors suggest that any tampering would be most likely to be discovered in the three states where they are looking. Stein also stated that without counting paper votes, it would be impossible to determine if any tampering occurred.",
    " Title: Tech Investor Roger McNamee Warns of Threats to Democracy, Public Health, and Privacy Posed by Social Media, Particularly Facebook\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his new book, \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\" (Penguin), longtime tech investor Roger McNamee, who advised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in the early years of the company, argues that Facebook poses a threat to democracy, public health, and users' privacy.\n\nIn an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" on Monday, McNamee stated that Facebook, along with other internet giants like Google, have created products that exploit the weakest elements of human psychology to create habits and addictions. He claims that these companies did not take sufficient steps to safeguard users from potential misuse by malicious actors.\n\nMcNamee attributes Facebook's success in creating a revolutionary social media platform, which has been beneficial for advertisers, as the root of the problem. He argues that Facebook's ability to target users specifically, which allowed foreign actors to interfere in elections and referendums, also allows advertisers to reach their desired audience effectively.\n\nMcNamee criticizes Facebook for alleged instances of exploiting minors, citing two recent cases where Facebook was accused of charging minors for games and spying on users' activities. In response, Facebook stated, \"We take criticism seriously. Over the past two years, we've fundamentally changed how we operate to better protect the safety and security of people using Facebook.\"\n\nMcNamee challenges Facebook's assertion that it has responded to issues or bad actors on the platform, stating that there have been cases where Facebook has been called out and did not change. He points to instances such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development citing Facebook for advertising tools that allowed discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act, and the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Facebook for improperly handling user data, which led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nMcNamee characterizes Facebook as being in a state of a 15-year apology tour, maintaining a black box that prevents users from inspecting what is happening on the platform, and then apologizing and promising to do better. He emphasizes the need for investigations into these tech companies to understand the issues and make informed decisions as voters and citizens.\n\n\"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\" by Roger McNamee (Penguin) is available in hardcover, eBook, and audio formats via Amazon.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Hardline Immigration Measures in DACA Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has issued a list of hardline immigration demands, including funding for a border wall with Mexico and restrictions on children from Central America, as its first move in negotiations for a deal to allow young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers to stay in the U.S. legally. The list, which also includes withholding federal grants for \"sanctuary cities\" and limiting legal immigration, has been met with rejection by Democrats, who have labeled it \"immoral\" and \"far beyond what is reasonable.\"\n\nThe list of principles also calls for a points-based system for migrants to gain entry to the U.S. and a reduction in family-based green cards issued to spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.\n\nIn response, Democrats and advocacy groups for Dreamers have expressed horror and condemnation. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat from New Mexico and chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, stated that Democrats would use \"every leverage point we have at our disposal to protect these Dreamers.\"\n\nLast month, the Trump administration announced plans to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program established by the Obama administration that issued renewable two-year permits to people brought to the country illegally as children, shielding them from deportation and allowing them to work and attend school. About 690,000 recipients are enrolled in the program, with the last such work permits due to expire in March 2018.\n\nCongressional Democratic leaders had been optimistic about striking a deal, but the new list of demands has been met with criticism. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said in a joint statement that the list \"goes so far beyond what is reasonable\" and \"fails to represent any attempt at compromise.\"\n\nTrump has previously stated that funding for the wall could be addressed separately and suggested that he did not expect it to be included in any DACA bill. Lujan Grisham also condemned the use of the futures of hundreds of thousands of people to further White House policy goals.\n\nWhile Trump's list will appeal to a number of conservative Republicans, some lawmakers in the party are wary of sweeping reforms. At a Senate hearing last week, Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina who has proposed legislation to protect DACA recipients, warned, \"If Congress has proven an extraordinary ability to do anything, it's to fail at comprehensive immigration reform.\"",
    " Title: Conservative Book Club Reveals Top 10 Conservative Books and Movies of 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nChristopher Malagisi, the editor-in-chief of the Conservative Book Club, has curated a list of the best books and movies for conservatives in 2016. In an exclusive end-of-the-year video interview for the \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation, Malagisi discusses the top 10 conservative books, five runners-up, and the top seven conservative movies of the year.\n\nThe top ten books on the list include:\n1. \"The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion\" by Jonathan Haidt\n2. \"The Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation\" by Rod Dreher\n3. \"The Conservative Sensibility\" by George Will\n4. \"The Tyranny of Cliches: How the French Political Class Has Hijacked the French Revolution\" by Pascal Bruckner\n5. \"The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam\" by Douglas Murray\n6. \"The Right to Be Right: Ex exposing the Tyranny of Political Correctness\" by Ben Shapiro\n7. \"The Art of the Deal: The Most Popular Business Book of All Time\" by Donald J. Trump\n8. \"The City and the Swamp: How the Building of Rome Saved Civilization\" by Victor Davis Hanson\n9. \"The War on History: The Cultural Revolution at 50\" by Victor Davis Hanson\n10. \"The Devil's Pleasure Palace: The Cult of Critical Theory and the Subversion of the West\" by Michael Walsh\n\nAuthors making the honorable mention list include Ann Coulter, Megyn Kelly, Brad Thor, Phyllis Schlafly, and a graphic novel creator.\n\nSome of the top conservative movies of 2016 include:\n1. \"13 Hours\"\n2. \"Hell or High Water\"\n3. \"Hacksaw Ridge\"\n4. \"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party\"\n5. \"Captain America: Civil War\"\n6. \"Risen\"\n7. \"Silence\"\n\nMalagisi believes that American culture has been dominated by the left, and that students are not being taught why America is exceptional. He views conservatism as the preservation of the best from 2,500 years of human history that culminated in the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing liberty and rights previously unknown across the planet. In America's form of government, citizens were entrusted to run their own republic and have great capacity to be self-governing, with only a limited government that was to be held accountable by the people.\n\nMalagisi questions how people can preserve what they do not understand, and suggests that people can learn more about politics by engaging the culture through entertainment, whether it is books, movies, TV, music, or art. This is why Malagisi's work is focused on books, movies, and TV at the successful Conservative Book Club, an organization with some 850,000 members.\n\nFor more information on the Conservative Book Club, visit their user-friendly website or follow them on Facebook or Twitter @ConservBookClub.

    " Title: Clinton Urges Swift Action on Syria's Chemical Weapons as Diplomatic Solution Emerges\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that any move by Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to international control would be an \"important step\" amid signs of a diplomatic solution in the international crisis over Syria. Clinton made these comments during a visit to the White House, following U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's statement in London that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could avoid a military strike by surrendering all his chemical weapons within a week.\n\nClinton expressed skepticism about Assad's compliance, stating, \"This cannot be another excuse for delay or obstruction.\" She added, \"Russia has to support the international community's efforts sincerely or be held to account.\"\n\nClinton's comments came after she met with President Barack Obama and attended the White House Forum to Combat Wildlife Trafficking. She described the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons as a violation of a global norm that is fundamental to the international order.\n\nThe White House is seeking Congress's approval for a military strike against Syria's government in response to a chemical weapons attack. However, a new proposal suggests that Syria could avoid a strike by turning over its chemical weapons stockpiles. Clinton credited Kerry and the Russian government for proposing this solution.\n\nClinton emphasized the need to address Syria's chemical weapons threat \"as swiftly and comprehensively as possible.\" She called on Russia to support the international community's efforts or face accountability.\n\nThe Obama administration is stepping up pressure on a skeptical Congress to support U.S. military action in Syria, despite considering the Russian proposal to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control. Obama is conducting a series of television interviews and is due to visit the Capitol to make his case to lawmakers before delivering a televised address from the White House.\n\nSyria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has welcomed the Russian proposal to avert U.S. strikes by putting Syria's chemical weapons under international control and quickly dismantling them. The Obama administration has expressed deep skepticism about this proposal and does not want it to be used as a stalling tactic.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is considering asking the Security Council to demand Syria move its chemical arms stocks to Syrian sites where they can be safely stored and destroyed. Britain and France have given the idea tentative support.\n\nThe intensifying lobbying by the Obama administration comes ahead of a crucial U.S. Senate test vote expected on Wednesday on whether to authorize military action in response to last month's chemical weapons attack against Syrian civilians. Some members of Congress have expressed doubts about military action, and polls indicate that Americans, weary after wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, strongly oppose military action.\n\nMike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of strikes, said Obama had \"fumbled\" the message on Syria and faced a critical moment. Assad, in an interview with CBS television, denied any link between his government and the suspected Aug. 21 chemical attack near Damascus that U.S. officials say killed over 1,400 people. If there were strikes against Syria, the United States \"should expect everything,\" Assad said.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that Russia could be most effective in encouraging Assad to stop the use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions under United Nations control until they can be destroyed.\n\nA survey by USA Today on Monday found majorities of both the Senate and House remained uncommitted on whether to back military action, complicating predictions about the outcome. A fraction of lawmakers - 22 senators and 22 House members - are on record as supporting strikes, with 19 senators and 130 House members saying they are against.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee narrowly passed a resolution last week that prohibited the insertion of U.S. ground combat troops in Syria and limited the intervention to a maximum of 90 days. With the hunt on for more votes, other alternatives are being explored. Representative Chris van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, is writing a resolution with Democrat Gerald Connolly of Virginia that would be narrower than the Senate resolution. The resolution would make it clear that the only purpose of military action is to deter Assad from future use of chemical weapons.\n\nSenator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, is working with Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia on an alternative that would give the Assad government 45 days to sign an international chemical weapons ban and begin the process of turning over its weapons. \"During this time, the U.S. would work to build international support and create a global response on the use of chemical weapons in Syria,\" Heitkamp said.",
    " Title: Giuliani Disputes Racism Claims in Eric Garner's Death\n\n Article:\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican, has stated that racism was not a factor in the death of Eric Garner last July, as police officer Daniel Pantaleo used a chokehold while attempting to arrest him. Giuliani cited two reasons to support his claim: the presence of a black sergeant at the scene, and the assertion that any suspect under similar circumstances would have been treated the same.\n\nProtests erupted in New York City and across the country following Wednesday's announcement that Pantaleo would not be indicted in Garner's death. The protesters have drawn parallels between Garner's death and the death of Michael Brown, a black youth in Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot last August by white policeman Darren Wilson. A grand jury also failed to indict Wilson, leading to protests in Ferguson and several other cities.\n\nGiuliani accused New York Democrat Mayor Bill de Blasio, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, and others of tearing down respect for the criminal justice system by suggesting racism was involved in the Garner incident. He argued that such comments contributed to the atmosphere of protests and, in some cases, violence.\n\nGiuliani maintained it was racist to focus on the \"handful\" of incidents where blacks were killed by police, rather than the numbers who died from black-on-black crime. He stated that police should never kill anyone unjustifiably but that the majority of time should be spent addressing the high rates of crime within the black community.\n\nIn the aftermath of the grand jury announcement, Giuliani suggested that Mayor de Blasio should emphasize patience and calm and focus on the ways people in the community are actually victimized if he truly cares about them. Giuliani also criticized New York Democrat Rep. Charlie Rangel for stating that it was \"totally impossible to believe that someone can die, and nobody is indicted.\"\n\nGiuliani suggested that activists like Sharpton could accomplish something constructive if they spoke about crime in the black community with the same passion and intention as they did in the \"few situations where police shoot someone.\" He argued that both Garner and Brown had committed crimes and that perhaps they \"would not be dead today\" if they had not resisted arrest.\n\nGiuliani also defended the grand jury process, stating that he had always found grand juries to be \"extraordinarily conscientious citizens\" who take their oath and the process very seriously.",
    " Title: Obama Distances Himself from Iraq Troop Withdrawal, Citing Iraqi Government's Rejection of U.S. Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has distanced himself from the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, a policy he had long touted as a significant foreign policy achievement. In a press conference on Saturday, Obama blamed his predecessor, George W. Bush, for the absence of American troops in Iraq and rejected the assertion that he could have left a small peacekeeping force in the war-torn nation.\n\nDuring the 2011 troop withdrawal, three years after the initial authorization, and following a successful re-election campaign, the full removal of U.S. forces from Iraq was cast as the White House's most significant foreign policy achievement. Obama had promised this during the earliest days of his first presidential campaign in 2008.\n\nHowever, with the terrorist group Islamic State (IS) gaining territory in Iraq, Obama has begun to adjust the narrative. \"What I just find interesting is the degree to which this issue keeps on coming up, as if this was my decision,\" Obama said. \"Under the previous administration, we had turned over the country to a sovereign, democratically elected Iraqi government.\"\n\nObama's new take on the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal differs greatly from how he portrayed it in 2012, during his re-election campaign against Republican Mitt Romney. While it's true the administration did support keeping a small residual force in Iraq, Obama frequently took credit for fully ending American involvement in Iraq and for leaving no U.S. boots on the ground in that country.\n\nIn an October 2012 debate with Romney, the president seemed to deny that he supported a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government, a deal that would have formally allowed American troops to remain in Iraq and would have protected them from prosecution in Iraqi courts.\n\nThe White House's change in stance on Iraq comes at a time when Obama's broader foreign policy is under fire across the political spectrum. In an interview with The Atlantic over the weekend, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama's 2008 Democratic primary rival and the party's 2016 presidential front-runner, questioned the administration's underlying foreign policy principle.\n\nRepublicans have been harsher in their critiques, charging that Obama is proving his incompetence with his handling of the Iraq crisis. \"Truly, it seems as if there is no threat that has not managed to catch him utterly off-guard,\" said Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona Republican.\n\nAnalysts say the president is entirely correct about the Iraqi government having no interest in allowing U.S. forces to remain in the country. Indeed, Iraqi leaders refused to guarantee American troops immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts, which the administration viewed as a necessary prerequisite for allowing any kind of follow-on force.\n\nAlthough the Iraqis, to some degree, kicked out American troops, Obama portrayed the withdrawal as proof that the U.S. was leaving behind a sovereign, largely peaceful Iraq. However, with the Islamic State group now in control of key areas across Iraq, including the nation's largest dam, that claim has been debunked, some analysts say.\n\n\"The bigger issue is that in pulling out he tended to emphasize the story, as Bush had, that we had stood up a lasting, stable government and a functional military,\" said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"That was always doubtful and has now been proven wrong.\"",
    " Title: Macron Urges Caution on Iran, Trade, and Climate in Interview Ahead of U.S. Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has emphasized the strength of his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of his visit to the United States this week, but also cautioned the president on his stances regarding Iran, climate change, and international trade. In an exclusive interview with Fox News on Friday, Macron stated, \"You can not make a trade war with your allies. It\u2019s too complicated.\"\n\nThe visit, which includes a dinner with Trump and first lady Melania Trump at Mount Vernon on Monday and a state dinner at the White House on Tuesday, will mark Trump's first official state visit since taking office last year. Macron is also scheduled to make a joint address to Congress on Wednesday.\n\nMacron described his relationship with Trump as \"very special,\" suggesting they share a commitment to fighting terrorism and reducing the influence of rogue nations and dictators. However, he urged Trump to maintain the Iran Nuclear Deal, in which economic sanctions are lifted in exchange for Iran winding down its nuclear program, ahead of a May 12 sanctions deadline.\n\nMacron also expressed optimism that Trump will exempt European countries from the international tariffs he intends to impose on aluminum and steel. He reiterated, \"You don\u2019t make trade war with your allies.\"\n\nLast year, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, a 2015 agreement in which world leaders agreed to reduce carbon emissions. Macron, who was elected last year on a centrist, anti-establishment platform, also attempted to address a controversy about whether he persuaded Trump to keep U.S. forces in Syria.\n\nMacron suggested the U.S. maintain a diplomatic presence in Syria, stating, \"We will have to build a new Syria after war.\" He also expressed his belief in the U.S.'s important role in maintaining peace and multilateralism.\n\nMacron also stated he would ask Congress for its support in efforts to combat terrorism and rein in rogue nations. He described the U.S. as \"one of the last resorts\" for peace and multilateralism. Regarding the ongoing investigation into whether the 2016 Trump presidential campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the White House race, Macron said, \"I\u2019m not the one to judge\" Trump over current controversies or investigations.\n\nMacron concluded, \"We are very much attached to the same values...especially liberty and peace.\" He added, \"The U.S. today has a very strong role to play for peace in different regions of the world and especially the Middle East.\"",
    " Title: Discrepancies Between Michael Cohen's Plea and Donald Trump Jr.'s Testimony Raise Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent guilty plea by Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Donald Trump, has raised questions about Donald Trump Jr.'s testimony to Congress regarding his family's real estate negotiations with powerful Russians.\n\nIn September 2017, Donald Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was only \"peripherally aware\" of negotiations that Cohen has admitted to carrying on through June 2016. However, Cohen's guilty plea states that he had briefed Trump's family members about his talks, although the court documents do not specify who.\n\nTrump Jr. also told Senate investigators that he was not aware that Cohen had reached out to the press secretary for Vladimir Putin as part of his talks with Moscow about a putative new Trump Tower project there. Cohen had previously testified that although he emailed Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, he had not heard back, and the discussions with people in Moscow concluded by January 2016.\n\nHowever, in his guilty plea, Cohen acknowledged that Peskov had responded to him and he and others had continued negotiations about the project until after Trump had become the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nTrump Jr.'s answers allude to a number of prospective projects; he was asked by Senate investigators about news reports about a Trump Tower Moscow negotiation that took place in 2015 and 2016, which he acknowledged but did not detail.\n\nThe contrasts between Cohen's statement and Trump Jr.'s version of events may complicate potential legal problems for Trump Jr. Although seldom prosecuted, lying to Congress is against the law\u2014as evidenced by Cohen's plea.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said he has made referrals to the office of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller because he said he believed people had not given his committee the truth. He declined to identify who might be involved or how often he has referred cases to Mueller, but Burr did allude to Cohen's plea as an example of what he called the consequences that could be involved.\n\n\"One instance just highlighted of late is that the special prosecutor made an indictment yesterday using the transcripts of interviews we have done in our committee to indict somebody for lying to Congress,\" Burr said on Friday.\n\n\"It's a loud message to everybody that is interviewed by our committee... If you lie to us, we're going to go after you.\"",
    " Title: Kavanaugh Stresses Judicial Independence, Refuses to Criticize Trump in Senate Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a three-day Senate confirmation hearing, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh emphasized the judiciary's authority to check the power of the White House, but declined to comment on President Donald Trump's character or his criticism of the judiciary. On the second day of questioning, Kavanaugh faced pressure from Democrats over newly released emails that highlighted his views on abortion and racial issues.\n\nThe documents, released on Thursday, dated from Kavanaugh's service in the White House under President George W. Bush more than a decade ago. Democrats had objected to an earlier decision by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican leadership not to make the emails public.\n\nThroughout the hearing, protesters hostile to Kavanaugh repeatedly interrupted the proceedings. Despite the disruptions, Kavanaugh remained in good humor, making no gaffes that could potentially derail his confirmation in a Senate narrowly controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.\n\nSome liberals have expressed concern that Kavanaugh could be a rubber stamp for Trump and protect him from lawsuits and investigations. When asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he was picked because of an expectation of loyalty to Trump, Kavanaugh responded, \"My only loyalty is to the Constitution. I'm an independent judge.\"\n\nKavanaugh refused to say whether he had \"the greatest respect\" for Trump, a phrase Booker said he had used when describing Bush. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said Kavanaugh's nomination comes at a time when Trump poses a threat to America's rule of law and is facing an ongoing special counsel investigation.\n\nKavanaugh said his 12 years as a judge demonstrated he was unafraid \"to invalidate executive power when it violates the law.\" If confirmed, Kavanaugh is seen as likely to tilt the top U.S. court even further to the right.\n\nIn a 2003 email released on Thursday, Kavanaugh suggested striking a line from a draft opinion piece that had stated, \"It is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" saying that the Supreme Court could overturn it.\n\nAsked about that document, Kavanaugh said he suggested the change because he thought the draft language was overstating the thinking of legal scholars at the time. He again declined to say whether the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, Roe v. Wade, was correctly decided, although he indicated - as he did on Wednesday - that it was a decision that merited respect as \"an important precedent of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe hearing opened with Democrats complaining that various documents had not already been made public by the committee's Republican leaders. They were released by the committee minutes later. Booker called the process used by the committee to decide which documents to make public \"a bit of a sham,\" a characterization rejected by the panel's Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley. Booker said he was willing to face possible punishment under Senate rules by releasing the documents himself, although Republicans said they had already agreed to release them.\n\nTrump picked Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June. The committee considering Kavanaugh's nomination will hear from outside witnesses on Friday before the hearing wraps up. Republicans hope the full Senate can vote on the nomination close to the time the Supreme Court's new term starts on Oct 1.",
    " Title: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Remains in Office Despite Reports of Resignation or Dismissal\n\nArticle:\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein remains in his position, contrary to reports on Monday that suggested he had resigned or offered to do so. The White House confirmed that President Donald Trump and Rosenstein had an extended conversation about news stories published last week regarding Rosenstein's alleged discussions about secretly recording the president or invoking the 25th amendment to remove him from office.\n\nThe two are scheduled to meet on Thursday, following the president's return from the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated in a statement that the meeting was at Rosenstein's request. The White House did not comment on reports that Rosenstein was expected to be fired imminently or had resigned.\n\nRosenstein oversees the investigation of Russian election interference and links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The New York Times reported last week that he discussed secretly recording the president and invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office. Rosenstein has since disputed the report, stating it was \"inaccurate.\"\n\nIf Rosenstein were to leave his position, it would potentially throw into question the oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Under the Department of Justice succession statute, Solicitor General Noel Francisco would be left in charge of supervising Mueller. However, Trump might also be able to appoint a temporary replacement on an \"acting\" basis for up to 210 days, who would need to have passed Senate confirmation for another post or be a senior official from a relevant department.\n\nAs anticipation of Rosenstein's departure grew on Monday, Democrats in Congress and former federal prosecutors called on Republicans to speak out in favor of protecting the Mueller investigation. Representative Val Demings of Florida stated, \"Congress must take immediate steps.\" Former US attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, tweeted, \"Time to protect the Mueller investigation. Now.\"\n\nRosenstein was overseeing Mueller's work after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself due to his contacts with Russian officials during the Trump campaign. Trump has repeatedly attacked Sessions for that move. In overseeing the special counsel, Rosenstein is responsible for approving major new directions in the investigation, for signing off on the budget, and for meeting regularly with Mueller to assess the investigation's progress.\n\nFor more than a year, Trump has railed against the Russia investigation, calling it a \"witch hunt\" and accusing the prosecutors involved, many of whom, like Rosenstein and Mueller, are Republicans, of harboring ulterior partisan motives. Trump's relationship with Rosenstein has been strained. The president has tweeted that Rosenstein is \"weak,\" but in August he also said the relationship was \"fantastic.\"\n\nFrustration moved in both directions, with Rosenstein reportedly growing \"angry\" at Trump in May 2017, after Trump used a memo written by Rosenstein to justify the firing of FBI Director James Comey. It was in the sensitive aftermath of that firing that Rosenstein suggested recording the president, the Times reported. One source told the Times Rosenstein had suggested recording the president \"sarcastically\"; others said he was serious.\n\nSources for the Times report included people familiar with memos kept by former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe about his conversations with Rosenstein. McCabe was fired by Trump in March, days before he was due to retire. In a statement on Monday, amid speculation that McCabe desired to undercut Rosenstein \u2013 his onetime superior at the justice department who played a direct role in the firing of McCabe's former boss, Comey \u2013 McCabe denied any hand in leaking the contents of his memos to the media.\n\n\"To be clear, I had no role in providing information of any kind to the media stories about events following director Comey's firing,\" McCabe said.\n\nThe 25th amendment, ratified after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, provides for various paths of presidential succession, including in case of the president being deemed \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" by the vice-president and a majority of cabinet officers. At a briefing to discuss the UN General Assembly, top foreign policy officials were peppered with questions about Rosenstein and the 25th amendment.\n\n\"Literally, I have never been in the White House when that conversation has happened,\" said the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley. \"I'm not aware of any cabinet members that are even talking about that. It is completely and totally absurd.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added, \"There was no discussion with me about the 25th amendment, so you can now report that there were two senior leaders who said your question is ludicrous.\"",

The upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February 2014, will mark the first time since 2000 that the United States will not be represented by a president, vice president, first lady, or former president. Instead, President Obama has chosen to send athletes such as openly gay tennis great Billie Jean King and two-time hockey medalist Caitlin Cahow to represent the country.\n\nThe Olympic Charter bans any \"kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda\" from Olympic sites. However, political protest and international gamesmanship have been a near-constant during modern games. The Council on Foreign Relations hosts a slide show highlighting controversies over the past century, narrated by NPR contributor Frank Deford.\n\nThe Olympics have been used as propaganda tools during significant historical events, such as the Cold War. The \"Miracle on Ice\" upset win by the U.S. men's hockey team over the Soviets in the winter of 1980 was a source of great pride for the U.S., while the Soviets celebrated their victory in men's basketball in the summer of 1972, the first time the Americans had lost an Olympic basketball game.\n\nPolitical tensions have also led to boycotts. The last Olympics held in Russia, in the summer of 1980, saw a U.S.-led boycott by more than 60 nations in protest of the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. In retaliation, the Soviets led more than a dozen socialist countries in refusing to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were held in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1988, the games in Sydney were the first Summer Games since 1972 that were not the subject of a formal boycott. In 1976, some African nations stayed home from Montreal to protest New Zealand's inclusion due to its rugby team's recent tour in South Africa, which was during the apartheid era. China and Taiwan have also had frequent spats over the freedom to compete, with China staying home between 1956 and 1980, and Taiwan withdrawing from the 1976 games after China pressured Canada not to allow the island nation to compete.\n\nChina was eager to showcase its economic success at the Beijing Summer Games in 2008, but many groups protested the country's human rights record. Formal boycotts did not get off the ground, and President George W. Bush attended the Beijing Olympics, but both Obama and his GOP presidential rival that year, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said they would have stayed home if they were in the White House.\n\nIn 2014, the political climate surrounding the Sochi Olympics is once again a topic of discussion, with some U.S. representatives calling for the games to be moved out of Sochi due to Russia's movement of troops into Georgia in 2008. The recent enactment of an anti-gay law in Russia has also sparked controversy and anger among American gay-rights groups.\n\nHistorian and journalist Eric Marcus notes that it is \"incredibly naive to think somehow you can screen out everything that's going on in the world during a given period of time, particularly in a part of the world that's problematic.\" The Olympics, it seems, will always be a platform for political expression and international gamesmanship.",
    " Title: China Reports Record Rise in Imported COVID-19 Cases as Students and Expats Return Home\n\nArticle:\n\nChina reported a record rise in imported coronavirus cases on Friday, with all 41 of the new confirmed cases originating from overseas, according to the country's National Health Commission. This brings the total number of such cases to 269, with no locally transmitted cases for the third consecutive day.\n\nThe main entry points for the returnees, many of whom are students studying abroad, are Beijing and Shanghai. These students have come back after many campuses in the United States and Europe shut down to stem rapidly rising infection rates there. Additionally, China-based expats have also returned in a flight to safety as businesses begin to reopen.\n\nSince March 11, when the World Health Organization characterized the epidemic as a pandemic, the cumulative number of imported cases in China has risen from 85 to 269, up by 216%. This is outpacing the 98% increase in the cumulative worldwide confirmed cases during the same period, according to Mi Feng, spokesman of the National Health Commission.\n\nAuthorities across China are tightening public health measures to prevent the import of the virus and a rebound in cases. Mi stated that China must strictly prevent the import of the virus from overseas and a rebound in cases.\n\nBeijing reported 14 new imported cases on Friday, with five being Chinese students returning from abroad. Shanghai reported a record nine cases, with five students flying back from Britain, France, and Switzerland. The southern provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the eastern provinces of Shandong and Zhejiang, as well as Shaanxi and Sichuan, all reported cases.\n\nIn response, Guangdong's health commission announced that travelers who enter Guangdong province from abroad will be subject to a 14-day quarantine on arrival, either in personal residences or at a centralized quarantine center at the expense of the traveler.\n\nInfected people have also entered China through the major transport hub of Shenzhen, including people making their way back to the mainland from Hong Kong by land.\n\nWhile the influx of infections from overseas remains modest, they present a potential threat to Chinese authorities keen to restart factories and get consumers to spend again. Analysts have slashed forecasts for China's first-quarter gross domestic product to levels not seen since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, with all sectors of the economy hammered by the coronavirus outbreak this year.\n\nThe total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,008 at the end of Friday, the health authority said. The death toll was 3,255, up by seven, a much slower rate than at the height of the crisis. The lack of locally transmitted cases for the third day running underscores a recovery that has prompted officials to relax restrictions, even in the virus epicenter of Wuhan.\n\nOn Saturday, the official Xinhua news agency reported that commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing cases of the virus can resume business, citing the municipal bureau of commerce. The first phase of a clinical trial of a vaccine has also begun, with 36 volunteers undergoing a 14-day quarantine at a centralized location.",
    " Title: Partisan Divide Stalls Defense Spending Bill on Capitol Hill\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Defense spending bill, which accounts for half of the country's discretionary budget, has become the latest legislation caught in the Capitol Hill partisan divide. For decades, Republicans and Democrats have largely agreed on a bill that pays for troops, ships, and aircraft, and sets military policy.\n\nLast week, the Senate failed to get a vote on the bill due to Majority Leader Harry Reid's reluctance to open contentious issues such as government spying and new sanctions on Iran. With world leaders nearing a deal to curb Iran's nuclear enrichment program, Reid aimed to avoid a vote on these issues being tacked onto the National Defense Authorization Act (an interim deal was reached this weekend).\n\nRepublicans argued that the leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate made a power grab and demanded they be allowed to offer amendments and get votes on them, a practice that has been the norm for decades. They also accused Reid of using too heavy a hand in running the chamber, as evidenced by the rules change last week on filibusters. The defense bill could have been completed months ago, but it was put off until the last minute to spare President Obama a few national security black eyes.\n\nSen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, pleaded for some amendments, offering a whittled list of 25 GOP amendments from the list of 350 put forth by members of both parties. Reid was not interested in allowing the last bill likely out of Congress this year to become a magnet for other matters.\n\n\"Everyone has to understand this is not going to be an open amendment process,\" Reid told his colleagues as he sought to limit amendments and wrap up the $625 billion defense measure after some three days of debate. He contends GOP delaying tactics have forced his hand.\n\nWith just a few legislative days left in the year, the latest machinations leave in jeopardy a bill that authorizes money for personnel, war-fighting equipment, and the conflict in Afghanistan. The Senate has to pass its bill and reconcile it with a version the House approved in June.\n\nIf the Senate cannot break the impasse when lawmakers return on Dec. 9, troops will still get paid, and fighter jets will continue to be built, thanks to the separate, all-encompassing spending bill. However, major policy changes might be lost, including several new measures to stem the epidemic of sexual assaults in the military.\n\nDoing without an authorization bill for the first time in half a century also would represent the fall of one of last bastions of comity in Congress.\n\nSen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"I'm nowhere close to giving up on completing the defense authorization bill, even though we will only have days, not weeks, to complete it.\"\n\nThe dysfunction is \"approaching an all-time low,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has participated in far more cordial, as well as more open, debates of the defense bill in decades past.\n\nIn decades past, the leadership often stepped aside and let the chairman and ranking member take charge, debating the bill for hours around-the-clock, allowing numerous Republican and Democratic amendments and plenty of votes. Amendments were offered, accepted, or rejected. Some senators eventually would abandon amendments under the long hours that former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, would make them be there for the debate. The Senate typically spent more than a week on the bill, Monday through Friday and sometimes Saturday, rather than the current schedule of Tuesday to Thursday.\n\nThis past week, the Senate voted on two amendments dealing with the fate of the detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Reid sought votes on measures addressing sexual assault in the services after some five hours of debate on Wednesday. Republicans objected as they pressed for other amendments.\n\nBy comparison, the House considered 172 amendments when it debated its version of the defense bill in June. It agreed to 148 of them by voice vote and held 21 recorded votes. Seven amendments were added to the bill through recorded votes over three days of debate, and 14 were rejected. The Senate purposely avoids the time constraints imposed in the House. But votes on just two amendments to the Senate defense bill, plus the measures on sexual assault, before final passage would have been an unusually low number for such a far-reaching measure. Inhofe said that in the past 17 years, the Senate has debated the bill an average of nine days, held an average of 11 roll call votes, and adopted nearly 100 amendments by voice vote.\n\nThe impasse, combined with the brouhaha over how Democrats unilaterally changed the Senate's filibuster rules on Thursday, left the Senate's defense stalwarts pessimistic about the road ahead. \"There's a lot of turmoil, and I'd like to tell you that the 2014 elections will fix everything,\" McCain said. \"I'm not sure that's the case. I think the problems go deeper than that.\"",
    " Title: House Democrats Announce Articles of Impeachment Against President Trump and US-Canada-Mexico Trade Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Tuesday and simultaneously announced a pending deal on a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact. The coincidental timing of these events allows endangered House Democrats to return home for the holidays with bipartisan landmark legislation to discuss, in addition to the impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), was the result of intense final negotiations over the weekend. The agreement was announced Tuesday morning in the U.S. due to a signing ceremony in Mexico City scheduled for Tuesday afternoon with officials from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demonstrating the Democrats' ability to accomplish legislative goals while pursuing President Trump's impeachment. The pending trade pact, which revamps the 1994 Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has been a priority for Trump, with some Democrats also seeking improvements to the deal.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), one of eight members Pelosi tapped to be USMCA negotiators, stated at a news conference Tuesday that Democrats removed onerous provisions the White House wanted. Vice President Mike Pence claimed Democrats \"acquiesced\"; however, Schakowsky countered that the Trump administration sent a deeply flawed trade deal that would have raised prescription drug prices across North America. The new deal, she said, prevents big pharma from raising the price of prescription drugs across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will consider the articles of impeachment at an evening session Wednesday, with the full House likely voting next week.\n\nIn a separate development, several freshman House Democrats shared their thoughts on the impeachment proceedings. Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), the most endangered Illinois House incumbent, discussed the impact of impeachment at Politico's \"Women Rule Summit\" on Tuesday. Underwood, who flipped a suburban Chicago district voting for Trump in 2016, noted that political corruption is not a foreign concept to her constituents, given Chicago's history.\n\nAnother freshman, Democrat Sean Casten, stated that the two narrow articles on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress zero in on \"where there's unambiguous, unambiguously clear evidence.\" Casten, who is making no further pronouncements until he's finished reading the entire record, described the articles as \"the closest to no-brainers that I could think of.\"\n\nRep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) is facing a Democratic primary challenge from the left. Lipinski, who represents a heavily Democratic district, stated he will \"carefully consider\" the impeachment articles \"in light of the evidence that has been brought forward in the inquiry.\"\n\nRep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) is facing a Democratic primary challenge from the left and has stated flatly that he supports the Articles of Impeachment against President Trump and intends to vote for them on the House floor next week.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), the only Chicago-area Republican, stated that impeachment is \"leaving us even more divided than before.\" Kinzinger added that there will be another presidential election in 11 months, and the voters will have the final say.\n\nRep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) represents a safe GOP downstate district. He stated that Democrats would rather attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election than let the people decide in November.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Bostock Decision Casts Doubt on Trump Administration's New Health Care Regulation for LGBTQ Discrimination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration finalized a regulation on Friday that permits health providers to discriminate against LGBTQ patients. However, three days later, the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which has cast the legality of this regulation into serious doubt.\n\nThe Court's decision in Bostock does not only question the new health care regulation; it also raises doubts about the Trump administration's opposition to anti-discrimination protections for transgender students. With Bostock, workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is now likely to be held illegal.\n\nBostock held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination \"because of... sex,\" is broad enough to forbid workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. If an employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee's sex when deciding to discharge the employee or if changing the employee's sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer, then an employer violates Title VII, according to Bostock.\n\nFor example, if an employer permits male employees to date and have sex with women but doesn't permit female employees to do the same, it engages in forbidden sex discrimination.\n\nTitle VII is not the only federal law prohibiting sex discrimination. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Affordable Care Act also prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. These provisions apply to nearly all public schools, colleges, universities, and hospitals because nearly all of those institutions receive federal assistance of some kind.\n\nBostock suggests that neither educational institutions nor health care providers may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals. If that's the case, the Trump administration's new health care regulation should fall. Lawyers challenging anti-LGBTQ discrimination by schools and health providers are likely already notifying judges of the Court's decision in Bostock, and other lawyers are preparing new lawsuits hoping to strike down the new health care regulation.\n\nBoth the Affordable Care Act and Title IX ban discrimination \"on the basis of sex.\" Although this language is different from the statutory language in Bostock, which forbids discrimination \"because of... sex,\" the Supreme Court has indicated that the words \"on the basis of\" and \"because of\" have the same meaning.\n\nIn Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools (1992), the Supreme Court held that Title IX's ban on discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" imposes the same duty to avoid sexual harassment that Title VII imposes on employers. Similarly, in Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr (2007), the Court considered an amendment to a federal law that changed the language of a statute from \"because of\" to \"based on.\" But the Court concluded that this amendment did not matter because \"there was no indication that this change was meant to be a substantive alteration of the statute's scope.\"\n\nUntil Bostock, the meaning of the word \"sex\" was hotly contested. Although the Court briefly considered a case brought by a trans plaintiff challenging discrimination by a public school district, the Supreme Court punted that case back down to a lower court. Bostock is the Court's first direct pronouncement on whether anti-LGBTQ discrimination constitutes \"sex\" discrimination.\n\nThe Obama administration read Obamacare's ban on discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" broadly and similarly to the way the Supreme Court interpreted the word \"sex\" in Bostock. The Trump administration's new regulations, by contrast, read the word \"sex\" much more narrowly. The Trump administration claims that its narrow interpretation reads Obamacare \"according to the plain meaning of the word'sex' as male or female and as determined by biology.\"\n\nWhen a federal statute is ambiguous and can reasonably be interpreted in multiple ways, the Supreme Court's decisions permit federal regulators to choose from among those reasonable interpretations. However, Bostock eliminates any ambiguity regarding the meaning of the word \"sex.\"\n\nIt has now been firmly established by the Supreme Court of the United States that a ban on \"sex\" discrimination also bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Bostock, in other words, should establish once and for all that no educational institution or health provider may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals\u2014at least if they wish to receive federal funds.\n\nThere is, however, at least one part of the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda that is likely to survive contact with the courts. In 2017, Trump announced his intention to prohibit transgender service members from openly serving in the military. Although some lower courts struck down this ban, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to temporarily reinstate the ban.\n\nIt's likely that the Court did so because it often defers to the elected branches on questions relating to the military or to national security. Indeed, in Rostker v. Goldberg (1981), the Supreme Court permitted the Selective Service System to engage in sex discrimination. So Rostker suggests that this administration might enjoy similar deference if it wishes to discriminate against transgender service members.\n\nOutside of the military, however, Bostock is a sweeping decision with implications stretching far beyond employment discrimination. Although the trans military ban may survive, much of the rest of the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda is in serious trouble after Bostock.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Clarifies Conditions for Stripping Immigrant's U.S. Citizenship\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that federal law allows courts to revoke the U.S. citizenship of individuals who obtained it through false statements, but only if those false statements contributed to the acquisition of citizenship.\n\nThe ruling, in the case of Maslenjak v. United States, was delivered by Justice Elena Kagan and vacated a lower court's decision that stripped Divna Maslenjak, a Serbian immigrant, of her U.S. citizenship.\n\nMaslenjak, along with her husband and two children, sought refugee status in 1998 to flee Bosnia. In 2006, she applied for U.S. citizenship, answering \"no\" to questions about providing false or misleading information during the immigration process. She became a U.S. citizen in 2007, but her answers were false. Her husband had served in the Bosnian Serb Army.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling states that the illegal act must have contributed to the obtaining of citizenship. In this case, the Court declared that the government must establish that Maslenjak's lying about her husband's military service was part of the cause of obtaining her own citizenship.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurring decision, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, stating that the majority's framework was too elaborate and suggested a less-elaborate holding for future cases. Justice Samuel Alito also wrote a separate concurring opinion, agreeing with the judgment but expressing a different interpretation of the immigration statute's requirements for false statements.\n\nKen Klukowski, senior legal editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588, covered the case and can be followed on Twitter @kenklukowski.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Rejects President Obama's Budget Proposal, Citing Social Security Changes and Tax Hikes\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has preemptively rejected President Obama's upcoming budget proposal, which reportedly includes tax hikes tied to modest changes in Social Security and other benefit programs. The president is set to unveil his budget on Wednesday, according to a senior administration official.\n\nThe administration's plan includes a provision to lower cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security, which would curb the growth in benefits. This move is part of the president's efforts to convince Republicans to accept increased revenues. The official stated that the plan to be unveiled next week \"is not a menu of options for them to choose from -- it's a cohesive package.\"\n\nHowever, Boehner has expressed opposition to the demand, noting that the president and his party already extracted tax increases on top earners as part of the deal to avert the fiscal crisis at the end of 2012. \"In the end, the president got his tax hikes on the wealthy with no corresponding spending cuts. At some point we need to solve our spending problem, and what the president has offered would leave us with a budget that never balances,\" Boehner said.\n\nDemocrats have argued that the recently enacted sequester cuts are too deep and continue to press for tax increases to help close the deficit. Many Democrats oppose drastic changes to entitlements. The inclusion of the Social Security provision by Obama was meant as a gesture to Republicans, but has already drawn the ire of liberal members of Congress.\n\nBoehner suggested the changes did not go far enough to warrant tax increases. \"When the president visited the Capitol last month, House Republicans stated a desire to find common ground and urged him not to make savings we agree upon conditional on another round of tax increases. If reports are accurate, the president has not heeded that call,\" Boehner said. \"If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes. That's no way to lead and move the country forward.\"\n\nObama's plan calls for additional tax revenue, including a proposal to place limits on tax-preferred retirement accounts for top earners. Obama has also called for limits on tax deductions by top earners, a proposal that could generate about $580 billion in revenue over 10 years. The administration claimed to be offering the Social Security change reluctantly.\n\nThe president's budget proposal aims to reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years. The reductions in growth of benefit programs, which would affect veterans, the poor, and older Americans, is sure to anger many Democrats. The inclusion of the Social Security provision in Obama's budget could face tough opposition from liberal members of Congress.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., fired off a statement Thursday in response to the rumor that Obama's budget could include the change. \"Millions of working people, seniors, disabled veterans, those who have lost a loved one in combat, and women will be extremely disappointed if President Obama caves into the long-standing Republican effort to cut Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans and their survivors through a so-called chained CPI,\" Sanders said. \"In 2008, candidate Barack Obama told the American people that he would not cut Social Security. Having him go back on his word will only add to the rampant political cynicism that our country is experiencing today.\"\n\nChained CPI is the Washington term for the revised inflation adjustment that would effectively curb annual increases in a broad swath of government programs, but would have its biggest impact on Social Security. The inflation adjustment would reduce federal spending over 10 years by about $130 billion, according to past White House estimates. Because it also affects how tax brackets are adjusted, it would also generate about $100 billion in higher taxes and affect even middle-income taxpayers.\n\nObama's budget, to be released next week, comes after the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-run Senate passed separate and markedly different budget proposals. House Republicans achieved long-term deficit reductions by targeting safety net programs; Democrats instead protected those programs and called for $1 trillion in tax increases. Obama's budget proposal includes features from an offer he made to House Speaker John Boehner during fiscal negotiations last year. Those talks ultimately failed, but Congress did agree to increase tax rates on top earners. The reductions in growth of benefit programs, which would affect veterans, the poor, and older Americans, is sure to anger many Democrats. Labor groups and liberals have long been critical of Obama's offer to Boehner for including such a plan. Obama's new plan would also replace the sequester with other spending cuts. But it will steer clear of major cuts to Medicaid, including tens of billions in reductions to the health care plan for the poor that the administration had proposed only last year.",
    " Title: Walgreens Boots Alliance to Close 200 U.S. Stores, Boosts Cost-Cutting Initiative\n\nArticle:\n\nDrugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has announced plans to close approximately 200 U.S. stores as part of its cost-cutting initiative, which is being boosted by an additional $500 million. The company expects to reduce costs by a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Walgreens stated that the cost savings opportunities were identified through a rigorous analysis, primarily in its Retail Pharmacy USA division. The company plans to close about 200 U.S. stores, reorganize corporate and field operations, drive operating efficiencies, and streamline information technology and other functions.\n\nPhilip Caruso, Walgreens' spokesman, stated that the company has not yet decided which stores will be closed, and there is no hard timeline for the store closures during the cost-cutting period. The soon-to-be closed stores make up roughly 2% of the Walgreens' 8,232 drugstores in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Walgreens also opened 71 new drugstores in this region in the first half of fiscal 2015, including 25 relocations.\n\nStore closings aside, Walgreens reported strong earnings, with shares jumping $4.94, or 5.6%, to $92.62. Walgreens said adjusted second-quarter net earnings increased 33.2% to $1.2 billion. Second-quarter sales also increased 35.5% to $26.6 billion.\n\nThe U.S. retail pharmacy division, which includes Walgreens and Duane Reade stores, posted sales of $21 billion in the second quarter, up 7.4% over the year-ago quarter. Total sales in stores open at least a year were up 6.9% over the same quarter a year ago.\n\nIn December, Walgreens closed on a deal, valued at close to $16 billion, to purchase the remaining stake of European health and beauty retailer Alliance Boots that it did not already own. The new company, which includes more than 12,800 stores in 11 countries, was renamed Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., and it took on ticker symbol WBA.",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Compares President Obama to Bernie Madoff, Criticizes GOP at CPAC\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin delivered a fiery speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Sunday, lambasting President Barack Obama, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and the Republican Party's post-election efforts.\n\nDuring her speech, Palin compared President Obama to white-collar criminal Bernie Madoff, stating, \"He is considered a good politician, which is like saying Bernie Madoff was a good salesman. The difference being, the president is using our money.\" She also urged Obama to \"step away from the teleprompter and do your job.\"\n\nPalin's speech was one of the most well-received of the weekend, which featured prominent Republican figures such as Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, and Marco Rubio. She reserved particular criticism for President Obama, but her barbs were not limited to him. She broadened her criticism to include the \"permanent political class\" who are in \"permanent campaign mode.\"\n\n\"Never before have our challenges been so big and our leaders so small,\" Palin said.\n\nPalin declined to run for president last year and decided against renewing her contract as a political commentator on Fox News. She stated that she brought a message from the \"heartland of America,\" which was simply that \"things are bad out here.\"\n\nDuring her more than 26-minute speech, Palin displayed the same renegade sensibility that won her the admiration of many Republicans when she emerged from relative obscurity to become Sen. John McCain's running mate in 2008.\n\n\"Now is the time to furlough the consultants,\" she said, echoing a commonly-heard refrain at this weekend's conference. \"If we truly know what we believe, we do not need professionals to tell us.\"\n\nPalin also waded into one of the country's most intractable policy debates, gun control. \"Background checks? Yeah, I guess to learn more about a person's thinking and associations and intentions. More background checks? Dandy idea, Mr. President \u2013 should have started with yours,\" she said.\n\nOn gun ownership, Palin joked about a Christmas gift her husband Todd had given her. \"You should have seen what Todd got me for Christmas. Well, it wasn't that exciting. It was a metal rack, case for hunting rifles to put on the back of a four-wheeler. Then though, I had to get something for him to put in the gun case, right. So, this go around, he's got the rifle, I got the rack.\"\n\nOn Mayor Bloomberg's large soda ban, Palin held up a Big Gulp, sipped from a straw, and said, \"Bloomberg is not around, our big gulps are safe. We're cool. Shoot, it's just pop with low-cal ice-cubes in it.\"\n\nOn the current state of politics in Washington, Palin said, \"We do not have leadership coming out of Washington, we have reality television.\"\n\nOn young conservatives, Palin offered advice: \"My only piece of advice to our young college Republicans is you've got to be thinking Sam Adams, not drinking Sam Adams. And that's just a joke. I do not want to hear from the CEO of some brewery accusing me of being an anti-beer-ite.\"\n\nOn freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who introduced her, Palin said, \"We need more Americans like Ted Cruz. Coming from Texas, Ted Cruz comes to town, chews barbed wire, and spits out rust.\"\n\nOn Obama administration transparency, Palin said, \"Barack Obama promised the most transparent administration ever.

    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee to Hold Confirmation Hearing for John Ratcliffe as Director of National Intelligence\n\n The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), President Trump's nominee for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) position. The hearing marks the first major Senate hearing since the coronavirus-induced hiatus.\n\nRatcliffe, a member of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Ethics Committees, was a staunch defender of Trump during the Russia investigation and was on the president's advisory team during the impeachment proceedings earlier this year. Trump first considered him for the DNI position last year, but he withdrew his name last August due to concerns about a potentially contentious, partisan confirmation process.\n\nRatcliffe told Fox News at the time, \"I made the decision to withdraw from consideration because, if your political future comes down to the vote of 100 U.S. senators, and you start out day one down 47 to nothing because every Democrat is against you, my concern was there's not a lot of margin for error there.\"\n\nTrump nominated Ratcliffe again in February. Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, is the current acting DNI, the second to have that role after former DNI Dan Coats' resignation last summer. Joseph Maguire was acting DNI until February.\n\nDemocrats' opposition to Grenell could improve Ratcliffe's chances of being confirmed now. Earlier this month, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) sent Grenell a letter demanding answers regarding organizational changes in his office, including President Trump's recent termination of Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.\n\nThe DNI position was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to oversee the U.S. intelligence community. The DNI serves on the president's cabinet and acts as an adviser to the president, National Security Council, and Homeland Security Council for national security-related intelligence issues.\n\nA former federal prosecutor, Ratcliffe often went on the attack during the Russia probe and its aftermath, questioning Special Counsel Robert Mueller's decision to write in his report that he could not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. During a July hearing, Ratcliffe stated, \"The special counsel\u2019s job didn\u2019t say you were to determine Trump\u2019s innocence or to exonerate him. The bedrock principle of our justice system is a presumption of innocence\u2014everyone is entitled to it, including a sitting president, and because of a presumption of innocence, a prosecutor never, ever needs to determine it.\"\n\nBefore joining Congress, Ratcliffe served as Chief of Anti-Terrorism and National Security for the Eastern District of Texas and as Mayor of Heath, Texas.",
    " Title: Poll Shows Most Americans Skeptical of President Trump's Denials of Russian Collusion\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by Suffolk University indicates that most Americans do not believe President Donald Trump's denials of collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia. The poll, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters, has a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points.\n\nThe survey found that nearly six in ten respondents have little or no trust in Trump's denials, while 35 percent say they have some or a lot of trust in the president's statements. More than a third of those surveyed expressed \"some\" trust in Trump's version of events.\n\nThe skepticism towards Trump comes as prosecutors continue to file court documents and plea deals in cases involving some of the president's closest associates, including his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who was sentenced last week to three years in prison.\n\nThe poll also found that most of those surveyed, 53 percent, have a lot or some trust in Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation, while 38 percent have little or no trust in the former FBI director and his investigation to be fair and accurate. In contrast, 59 percent expressed little or no trust in the president's denials, while 35 percent said they have some or a lot of trust in him to speak the truth.\n\nTrump has a core of unwavering supporters who endorse his argument that the Mueller investigation is a \"witch hunt.\" The proportion who say they have \"a lot of trust\" in the president's denials has not budged since March, remaining at 24 percent.\n\nThe poll also found that 50 percent of respondents believe Russians \"definitely\" interfered in the election to help Trump, while 27 percent believe they did not. Nearly as many, 46 percent, believe Trump associates \"definitely\" colluded with the Russians, while 29 percent believe they did not.\n\nThe poll was conducted by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Sunday. Those who follow the news most closely are the most skeptical, with two-thirds having little or no trust in Trump's denial. Nearly six in ten, 59 percent, say the Russians \"definitely\" interfered to help Trump, while a solid majority, 56 percent, say they are convinced Trump associates colluded with the Russians.\n\nDavid Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, stated that those who are following the investigation closely tend to lean more Democratic and find it useful and gratifying to see new allegations, plea deals, and indictments. Those who are not following the investigation closely are Trump supporters, in large part, and do not buy it. They are invested in Trump's success and are pained to watch his stock declining day after day with every new indictment.\n\nMueller, who has not responded publicly to Trump's frequent attacks in interviews and on Twitter, has a favorable-unfavorable rating of 39 percent-31 percent. His unfavorable rating has risen over the year, up from a 37 percent-23 percent rating in the Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll in March.\n\nViews of Mueller are in positive territory by a net 8 percentage points. Trump has a favorable-unfavorable rating of 40 percent-57 percent, in negative territory by 17 points.",
    " Title: U.S. Deploys F-22 Fighter Jets to South Korea During Joint Military Exercises; North Korea Enters \"State of War\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has deployed F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets to South Korea as part of joint military exercises with South Korea. This move comes in response to North Korea's declaration that it has entered a \"state of war\" with the South.\n\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye warned North Korea that any provocative moves will be met with \"a strong response.\" In a meeting with senior defense and security officials, she stated that if there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations.\n\nNorth Korea's recent verbal attacks against South Korea and the United States have included threats of a nuclear strike and labeling the U.S. mainland as a \"boiled pumpkin,\" vulnerable to attack. The two Koreas are technically still at war after their conflict in the early 1950s ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n\nThe U.S.-South Korean military drills have been a source of tension, with North Korea describing the U.S. practice flights over South Korea by B-52 bombers and B-2 stealth bombers as acts of U.S. hostility. There was no immediate reaction from North Korean state media regarding the deployment of F-22 Raptors to the main U.S. Air Force Base in South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea has continued to allow its workers to enter and leave the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas, despite North Korea's threats to shut it down. The heightened tensions have prompted North Korea's traditional allies, China and Russia, to urge both sides to exercise restraint.\n\nThe coming weeks may see more bouts of saber-rattling, as North Korean delegates are currently gathered for the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's rubber-stamp parliament. April 15, the anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un, is usually marked by large-scale parades. The U.S.-South Korean military exercises are due to continue until the end of the month.\n\nSome analysts have noted that Pyongyang has carried out some sort of military provocation within weeks of every South Korean presidential inauguration. President Park took office on February 25, five weeks ago.",
    " Title: Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib Denounce Israel's Decision to Bar Them, Call for Conditional U.S. Aid\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentatives Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) on Monday rejected calls for a boycott of visits to Israel by members of Congress, but emphasized that continued U.S. aid to Israel should be contingent upon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu improving conditions for the Palestinians.\n\nDuring a press conference, the two representatives denounced their exclusion from entering Israel and accused Netanyahu and President Trump of colluding to prevent their visit. They suggested that members of Congress should be allowed to observe how Israel utilizes billions of dollars in U.S. aid and urged their colleagues to reconsider the level of assistance.\n\n\"We must be asking, as Israel's ally, that Netanyahu stop the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and ensure full rights for Palestinians if we are to give them aid,\" said Omar.\n\nThe representatives were scheduled to visit Israel on Monday, but Netanyahu announced last week that they would not be admitted. Initially, his government had signaled that they would be allowed, but Netanyahu stated after reviewing their itinerary that they were seeking a platform to grandstand rather than engaging in a fact-finding mission.\n\nOmar and Tlaib denied this claim, stating that they had planned to meet with members of the Knesset, Israel's national assembly, and Israeli military veterans who have advocated for Palestinian self-determination. A version of their itinerary, obtained by a reporter for Israel's public broadcaster, showed meetings with several Palestinian activists and international human rights groups, but no lawmakers or officials.\n\nTheir trip was organized by Miftah, a nonprofit Palestinian advocacy group that has drawn criticism. They stated that they learned of the group from other members of Congress and were surprised at the criticism.\n\n\"We're also taken aback and learn from everybody else that there's some issues regarding them,\" said Tlaib, referring to the criticism of Miftah.\n\nIn 2016, Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, Dan Kildee of Michigan, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, and Hank Johnson of Georgia joined a trip organized by Miftah and the American Global Institute, according to Politico.\n\nThe congresswomen suggested that Trump had intervened to thwart their visit. The president and the two representatives have been exchanging barbs for months, with Trump accusing them of anti-Semitism and the representatives leading the push for his impeachment.\n\n\"We know Trump would love nothing more than to use this issue to pit Muslims and Jewish Americans against each other,\" said Omar.\n\nTlaib, whose family is Palestinian, became emotional as she recounted experiences of harassment by Israeli authorities despite being a U.S. citizen. Tlaib was granted an exemption from the Israeli government to visit her elderly grandmother as long as she did not advocate for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement while there, but she opted not to go, stating that she would \"be caged and bow down.\"\n\n\"All I can do... as the granddaughter of a woman living in occupied territory is to elevate her voice by exposing the truth,\" she said.\n\nTrump, who supported Israel's decision, called Tlaib \"obnoxious\" for prioritizing politics over her grandmother.\n\nDemocracy for America, a progressive advocacy group, had called for other members of Congress to refuse to visit Israel in solidarity with the congresswomen. However, Omar urged lawmakers to visit Israel to witness the conditions of the Palestinians.\n\n\"We can not let Trump and Netanyahu succeed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us,\" she said.",
    " Title: Impact of Amazon Rainforest Fires on Global Ecosystem\n\nArticle:\n\nEcologist Dan Nepstad, president and founder of the Earth Innovation Institute, discusses the immediate and long-term effects of fires in the Amazon rainforest with NPR's Audie Cornish.\n\nNepstad, who has studied the Amazon for over 30 years, explains the difficulty in determining the true extent of the fires due to their low visibility in intact forests. He states that the best way to detect forest fires is by observing smoke, as fires in open or damaged forests are easier to spot.\n\nAccording to Nepstad, the current fire season is the biggest in the last decade, with persistent fires burning felled forests. He attributes this to the drying out of deep, dense vegetation, which makes the forest more susceptible to fires and results in more intense and destructive blazes.\n\nNepstad also discusses the long-term threat of large-scale displacement of scrub vegetation, which alters the forest and makes it difficult to recognize as a pristine forest. He believes this scenario is the most worrisome for the Amazon's future.\n\nIn terms of solutions, Nepstad suggests shifting from fire-prone systems, such as extensive cattle farming, to more intensive, tree-based systems to discourage the use of fire and promote fire prevention.\n\nCornish asks Nepstad about the common description of the Amazon as the \"lungs of the world.\" Nepstad clarifies that this is a misleading statement, as the Amazon should be thought of as a cooling system for the planet, rather than its lungs. He explains that the Amazon absorbs energy through evaporation, which cools the planet, and losing the Amazon would significantly impact the way air and energy move around the globe, altering the climate.\n\nThe article concludes with a quote from Nepstad, emphasizing the global connection to the health of the Amazon.",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions Discusses Recusal from Russia Investigation and DACA, Immigration Reform, and Mass Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with Maria Bartiromo for \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressed no regrets about recusing himself from any Russia-related investigations, stating that he \"did the right thing.\" Sessions' decision in March 2017 to step aside from the Justice Department investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race reportedly upset President Trump, as special counsel Robert Mueller would now lead the investigation.\n\nRegarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Sessions stated that he was unsure if Congress would find a permanent legislative solution before the program's expiration on March 5. He noted that President Trump has offered a generous policy that goes beyond the protections offered under the Obama-era DACA program, potentially affecting an estimated 700,000 immigrants brought illegally to the United States by their parents.\n\nImmigration reform efforts in the Senate stalled last week, despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell conducting full, open debates on bipartisan and other reform proposals as the March deadline approaches. Sessions' immigration reform plan offers a potential path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million illegal immigrants.\n\nSessions also addressed the recent mass shooting at a Florida high school, stating that law enforcement officials need to improve their ability to identify potential mass shooters and act on any received tips. He met with a group of sheriffs and emphasized the importance of following up on tips and signs of potential mass shooters to prevent such tragedies.",
    " Title: Senate Approves Comprehensive Immigration Overhaul, Sending Bill to House for Consideration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has approved a sweeping immigration overhaul bill that aims to extend legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants while increasing border security. The vote, which took place on Thursday, was 68-32 in favor of the bill, sending it to the House of Representatives for further action.\n\nThe bill, which is the most significant overhaul of America's immigration system since the 1980s, would legalize millions of currently illegal immigrants, while expanding legal immigration and increasing border security. The legislation would require businesses to check the legal status of prospective employees, and it would provide for 20,000 new Border Patrol agents, 700 miles of fencing, and an array of high-tech devices to secure the border with Mexico.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions to expand the number of visas for highly skilled workers and establish a separate program for lower-skilled workers, as well as a temporary program for farm workers.\n\nThe bipartisan bill was drafted by a group of eight senators, four from each party, who met privately for months to produce a compromise. The bill faced opposition from some senators, with Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., calling it \"the mother of all amnesties.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives, which is controlled by the Republican party, has yet to indicate whether it will take up the Senate's bill or pursue its own piecemeal approach to immigration reform. House Speaker John Boehner declined to comment on the Senate bill on Thursday, stating that the House would go on recess next week and listen to its constituents before discussing the way forward.\n\nDespite the strong majority in favor of the bill in the Senate, Congress remains divided over the issue. Some Republicans have already declared the Senate bill \"dead on arrival\" in the House, while others are working on their own version of immigration legislation.\n\nThe question remains whether the Senate's vote will compel the House to follow suit. The Senate bill fell short of the 70 votes its backers were hoping to secure, a number they felt would help persuade House leaders to move forward.\n\nThe Senate bill's opponents voiced frustration as the Senate scrambled to finalize its work ahead of the looming recess. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, on Wednesday said he felt \"used and abused,\" as he tried to slow down the process and call for more amendments to be considered. All Democrats, in addition to 14 Republicans, voted for the legislation on Thursday, while all \"no\" votes came from the Republican side of the aisle.",
    " Title: Congressional Hesitation on Repealing the Affordable Care Act Sparks Debate on Entitlement Programs and Farm Subsidies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican party's promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has been met with resistance, as a significant portion of Americans, approximately half, have expressed support for the healthcare reform. This shift in public opinion has sparked a broader discussion on entitlement programs and farm subsidies in the United States.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, initially met with opposition, has seen a change in sentiment as people become more attached to the subsidies and guarantees it provides. This phenomenon is not unique to the U.S., as similar instances can be observed in other countries, such as France, where attempts to reform job protections, like a 35-hour work week, were met with widespread protests.\n\nThe issue of farm subsidies has been a contentious one, with the U.S. spending $23.3 billion in 1985, a significant increase from the initial $3 billion in the Depression era. These subsidies have been criticized for contributing to food surpluses, obesity, and the enrichment of a select few, such as the Fanjul family in Florida.\n\nIn the past, attempts to abolish programs like the Education and Energy Departments or the mohair subsidy have been unsuccessful. The mohair subsidy, initially implemented to protect against food shortages during the Depression, continues to exist despite its irrelevance in modern times.\n\nEntitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are the largest handouts in the U.S., with Medicare being mostly a handout due to the high cost of medical bills compared to the premiums paid. Proposing cuts to these programs is a politically challenging task.\n\nOne positive example of reform comes from the 1970s, when the Ford and Carter administrations successfully eliminated the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the jobs of bureaucrats who regulated gas prices. Despite initial resistance, these reforms were ultimately implemented.\n\nThe ongoing debate on entitlement programs and farm subsidies underscores the challenges of implementing change in the U.S. political system, as the interests of powerful lobbyists and the public's attachment to certain benefits often complicate the process.",
    " Title: Police Accountability: A National Issue Highlighted by the George Floyd Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe arrest and indictment of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd has sparked a national conversation about police accountability. Chauvin, who had 18 complaints over his 19-year tenure, was only disciplined twice, and the systemic issues that allowed him to remain in policing duties are now under scrutiny.\n\nAccording to reports, out of 2,600 complaints against the Minneapolis Police Department since 2012, only 12 resulted in an officer being disciplined. The most severe penalty was a 40-hour suspension. The fact that three of Chauvin's colleagues, who are also now indicted, watched as Floyd choked to death is also a matter of concern, reflecting on the police culture.\n\nThe protests and riots that followed Floyd's death show the consequences of a lack of accountability and public trust. Civil rights leaders have called for a national reckoning to end racism in America, but the unaccountability of bad cops is not primarily a racial issue. Instead, it is largely due to police union contracts that make it difficult to hold officers accountable for extreme misconduct.\n\nA 2017 Reuters report found that the standard for police discipline is often harder than for a criminal conviction. In some jurisdictions, prior complaints are expunged from the record after a few months, making it practically impossible to terminate repeat offenders. This issue is not unique to Minneapolis; a 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that more than 99% of federal employees received a \"fully successful\" rating.\n\nThe lack of accountability is not just a problem with police but throughout government. Due process is meant to protect against abuses of state power by police and other state agents, not to protect police when they abuse their power. The clash of rights means that accountability is basically nonexistent, leading to a loss of public trust, a breakdown of civil order, and a shift from norms to rules.\n\nPublic service, and especially police work, should be a source of pride and honor, but the absence of accountability leads instead to cynicism and disrespect. A new social contract with public employees is needed, with accountability for the public good as the core organizing principle. Safeguards against unfair accountability can readily be provided, but supervisors cannot be put to the proof in a legal proceeding. Accountability is not the only change needed to revive trust in American government; leaders and institutions must also display fidelity to accepted norms.",
    " Title: Negotiations Progress as Obama Expresses Hope for End to Government Shutdown and Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nAs negotiations continue over the weekend to resolve the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and the looming debt ceiling crisis, President Barack Obama expressed optimism in his weekly address on Saturday that the \"pain of this Republican shutdown\" will soon come to an end.\n\nThe President noted it as a \"positive development\" that House Republicans have proposed extending the nation's borrowing limit for six weeks. He stated, \"Once the debt ceiling is raised, and the shutdown is over, there's a lot we can accomplish together.\"\n\nThe administration has stated that the government will exhaust its authority to pay its bills unless Congress agrees to raise the debt limit by Thursday. The House and Senate are currently working on different proposals to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government, which has been shut down for 12 days.\n\nHouse Republicans have presented the administration with a proposal that would establish budget talks, although President Obama has not yet accepted it. Both sides are still in discussions. Speaker John A. Boehner held a session with GOP lawmakers on Saturday to update them on the status of negotiations.\n\nSenate Democrats are considering a plan that would extend the borrowing limit through the 2014 elections. Senate Republicans, on the other hand, are working on a proposal that would increase the borrowing limit until January, end the government shutdown, and delay the Obamacare medical device tax.\n\nRepublicans claim that President Obama is seeking increased revenue as part of the negotiations; the President, in his weekly address, stated that he wants to reduce budget deficits \"in a smarter, balanced way that lets us afford to invest in the things we need to grow.\"\n\nHouse Armed Services Chairman Howard \"Buck\" McKeon, a California Republican, urged the President to sign interim measures passed by the House to reopen some government services, including national parks. McKeon stated, \"The House has passed more than a dozen bills providing funding for things we can all agree on\u2014veterans, cancer research, National Guard, national parks, Head Start, food safety, flight safety, border security, nuclear weapon security, and more.\" He added, \"President Obama and Senate Democrats should back these bills immediately.\"\n\nAs negotiations progress, McKeon called on the President to work with Congress on plans to reopen the entire government and avoid defaulting on U.S. debts.",

Abe and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach reached an agreement to postpone the Games.\n\nIn a joint statement, the IOC and Abe stated, \"The Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games, and the international community.\"\n\nThe IOC and Abe also noted that the Olympic flame would remain in Japan and the Games would keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.\n\nEarlier, veteran IOC member Dick Pound had told USA Today that the event was on hold, but the IOC did not confirm or deny Monday whether the Games were going to be postponed. Pound stated, \"On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided.\"\n\nThe United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee signaled its support for delaying the Tokyo Olympics over the coronavirus. Pound also told USA Today that the ramifications of postponing the Games would be \"immense.\"\n\nThe IOC began detailed discussions to assess the impact of the coronavirus on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement, on Sunday. The committee added that these talks, held in full coordination and partnership with organizers and Japanese authorities, would likely be finalized within the next four weeks.\n\nCanada and Australia have already announced they would not be sending athletes to Tokyo, while USA Swimming called on U.S. officials to do the same. IOC President Thomas Bach sent a letter to athletes on Sunday explaining the decision and why it might take so long.

    " Title: Trump Administration Stands Firm on Steel and Aluminum Tariffs, Faces Criticism and Allies' Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration has shown no signs of backing down from its plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stating on Sunday that no country will be exempt from the proposed 25 percent and 10 percent duties on imported steel and aluminum, respectively.\n\nThe announcement of the tariffs on Thursday has caused market volatility, sparked international criticism, and raised concerns about a potential trade war. While President Trump's rhetoric has primarily focused on China, the tariffs will also affect significant imports from countries such as Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, and the European Union.\n\nThe Pentagon had recommended targeted tariffs to avoid upsetting American partners abroad. However, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated on ABC's \"This Week\" that the president is taking a broader approach, and he dismissed threats of retaliation from American allies as \"pretty trivial.\"\n\nTrade politics are often regional rather than ideological, but the debate over the tariffs has opened a rift between President Trump and his party, leaving him with support primarily from his ideological opposites.\n\nSenators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bob Casey (D-Pennsylvania) have expressed support for the tariffs, with Brown stating, \"Good, finally,\" and Casey tweeting, \"I urge the administration to follow through and to take aggressive measures to ensure our workers can compete on a level playing field.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's GOP allies on Capitol Hill have expressed concerns about the tariffs' potential economic and political consequences. They argue that other industries that rely on steel and aluminum products will suffer, and the cost of new appliances, cars, and buildings will rise if the president follows through. The end result could erode the president's base of support with rural America and blue-collar workers, the president claims to be trying to help.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) stated, \"There is always retaliation, and typically, many of these countries single out agriculture when they do that. So, we're very concerned.\"\n\nGov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) asked the administration to reconsider its stance, stating that American companies could move their operations abroad and not face retaliatory tariffs. The Business Roundtable's Josh Bolten, a chief of staff for President George W. Bush, called on Trump to step back from his campaign rhetoric on trade.\n\nTim Phillips, president of the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, noted that Trump narrowly won in Iowa and Wisconsin, two heavily rural states that could suffer if countries impose retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural goods.\n\nDespite the criticism, President Trump has shown no signs of backing down, tweeting, \"Trade wars are good and easy to win.\"",
    " Title: Attorney General to Release Redacted Mueller Report on Russian Election Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - Attorney General William Barr plans to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and contacts between Moscow and President Donald Trump's campaign on Thursday morning, according to the Justice Department. Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not provide a precise time, but stated that the report, which Barr has described as nearly 400 pages long, will be released to both Congress and the public.\n\nThe release of the report comes after Mueller turned over a copy of his confidential report to Barr on March 22, concluding his 22-month-long inquiry. In a four-page letter to Congress on March 24, Barr summarized what he said were Mueller's primary conclusions. He stated that Mueller's investigation did not establish that members of Trump's election campaign conspired with Russia.\n\nBarr also wrote that Mueller presented evidence \"on both sides\" about whether Trump obstructed justice by acting to impede the inquiry, but he did not draw a conclusion one way or the other. Barr stated that he reviewed Mueller's evidence and made his own determination that Trump did not commit the crime of obstruction of justice.\n\nJustice Department regulations grant Barr, a Trump appointee and the top U.S. law enforcement officer, broad authority to decide what to release and what to withhold from the report. Barr has pledged to be as transparent as possible but has stated that he will redact certain portions for reasons including protecting secret grand jury information, intelligence-gathering sources and methods, information relating to ongoing cases, and the privacy of \"peripheral third parties\" who were not charged.\n\nThe redactions in the report will be color-coded by category, according to Barr, explaining the reasons that parts are blacked out. After Barr released his four-page letter, Trump claimed \"complete and total exoneration,\" condemned \"an illegal takedown that failed,\" and accused unnamed political enemies of treasonous acts.\n\nSince Barr released his letter, Trump has set his sights on the FBI, and accused the Justice Department of improperly targeting his campaign. Last week, Barr told a U.S. Senate panel he believed that \"spying\" did occur on Trump's campaign, and he plans to investigate whether it was properly authorized. Barr's comments were criticized by Democrats, already skeptical of how he has handled the report's release.\n\nThe attorney general has pledged to testify publicly about the report's conclusions before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on May 1 and 2, respectively. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee voted on April 3 to empower its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to issue subpoenas for the full report and underlying evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Intelligence Committee are also asking Barr to produce all of the investigative materials compiled by Mueller's team and to make Mueller and his staff available for a briefing. In a March 27 letter seen by [redacted] on Monday, Democratic Chairman Adam Schiff and top Republican Devin Nunes told Barr they want Mueller to brief them on \"the investigation's scope and areas of inquiry, its findings, and the intelligence and counterintelligence information gathered\" in the investigation.",
    " Title: Billionaire Sheldon Adelson Emerges as Top Campaign Donor in 2012 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2012 political campaign season marked by significant political spending, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, stand out as the most prolific donors. On Wednesday, it was reported that the Adelsons donated $10 million to Restore Our Future, a super PAC supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. This contribution brings their total donations to super PACs during the 2012 campaign to at least $35 million, more than twice the amount donated by their closest competitors, billionaire industrialists Harold C. Simmons and his wife, Annette.\n\nWith a net worth of approximately $25 billion, Mr. Adelson has the financial means to contribute significantly more. In an interview with Forbes magazine this year, he suggested he would consider spending up to $100 million on the 2012 elections.\n\nInitially, most of the Adelsons' contributions went to Winning Our Future, a super PAC that provided critical support to Newt Gingrich, Romney's primary rival. Winning Our Future spent millions of dollars on advertisements criticizing Romney's record at Bain Capital during the winter months. Mr. Adelson has publicly expressed reservations about Romney, describing him as timid compared to Gingrich.\n\nHowever, since Gingrich's withdrawal from the race in early May, the Adelsons have shifted their support to Romney. The two met for lunch at The Venetian, Mr. Adelson's Las Vegas hotel, later in May. Last week, it was reported that Mr. Adelson was considering a contribution of $1 million to $10 million to Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney super PAC.\n\nMr. Adelson has close ties to many of Romney's other supporters, particularly wealthy Jewish donors, with whom he has served on the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition. Restore Our Future's political director, Carl Forti, was also involved with the issue advocacy group Freedom's Watch, which spent $17 million during the 2008 election. The exact amount of the Adelsons' contribution to Restore Our Future has not been disclosed.",
    " Title: Huawei Responds to US National Emergency Declaration and Export Controls\n\nArticle:\n\nHuawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, has responded to the United States' declaration of a national emergency and the subsequent imposition of strict export controls. The executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, empowers the government to ban technology and services from \"foreign adversaries\" deemed to pose \"unacceptable risks\" to national security. The order does not name specific countries or companies but comes after months of US pressure on Huawei.\n\nIn a statement reported by the state-run Global Times, Huawei said, \"If the US restricts Huawei, it will not make the US safer, nor will it make the US stronger. It will only force the US to use inferior and expensive alternative equipment, lagging behind other countries... and ultimately harming US companies and consumers.\" The company expressed its willingness to \"communicate with the US to ensure product security,\" echoing reassurances given to the UK.\n\nThe US Commerce Department has added Huawei and 70 affiliates to its \"entity list,\" banning the company from acquiring components and technology from US firms without government approval. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the US. The order directs the commerce department, working with other government agencies, to draw up a plan for enforcement within 150 days.\n\nThe US and China have recently increased tariffs in a battle over what US officials call China's unfair trade practices. Talks between Washington and Beijing have ground to a halt, causing volatility amid concerns about a global trade war. China has announced plans to increase tariffs on nearly $60bn worth of US imports beginning on 1 June, in what the Chinese government said was a retaliatory move after Washington imposed tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.\n\nHuawei has strongly denied US allegations that its equipment could be used by the Chinese state to spy. Ren Zhengfei, the company's founder and chief executive, claimed in February that Huawei would reject any efforts to gather intelligence through its products even if the Chinese government required it to do so.\n\nThe US has previously labeled Huawei a threat and lobbied allies not to use Huawei network equipment in next-generation 5G networks, calling it untrustworthy. Allies who allow Huawei technology inside their 5G networks have been told they may be frozen out of US intelligence sharing. Australia, New Zealand, and Japan have banned Huawei from their 5G networks. In the UK, BT has excluded Huawei telecoms infrastructure from its own 5G rollout and removed some of its equipment from the 4G network. In January 2019, Vodafone said it had decided to \"pause\" the use of Huawei equipment in its core networks across Europe.

Wade\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent appointment of two justices by former President Donald Trump has sparked discussions about the potential overturning of the landmark case Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide. However, it is essential to understand that the court's actions may not be as straightforward as some might assume. This article will explore several possible scenarios that could unfold following any changes to Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe first category, referred to as nuclear options, encompasses the most extreme and least likely scenarios. The first nuclear option would be a complete reversal of Roe v. Wade, establishing a constitutional ban on abortion. This would outlaw abortion across the United States, making it illegal for women to obtain the procedure.\n\nA second nuclear option involves the court dismantling the right to privacy, which was established in the 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut. The right to privacy is the foundation for Roe v. Wade, and its elimination would eradicate the basis for Roe v. Wade, returning the issue to the states and allowing them to regulate abortion as they see fit.\n\nThe second possibility is the court overruling Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to privacy intact but eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. In a post-Roe world, states would be free to regulate abortion as they wish, with some advocacy groups suggesting that as many as 22 states could potentially ban abortion entirely.\n\nThe third possibility is the court chipping away at Roe v. Wade, imposing increasingly restrictive abortion laws while maintaining the right to privacy. This could result in a patchwork of laws across the country, making it more difficult for women in certain states, particularly poor women, to access abortion services.\n\nIt is important to note that the likelihood of each scenario varies, and the court's actions may not follow a linear path. Chief Justice John Roberts, known for his incrementalist approach, may be less likely to pursue the most extreme options.\n\nIn conclusion, while the future of Roe v. Wade remains uncertain, it is crucial to understand the potential outcomes and their implications for women's reproductive rights in the United States. The possibility of more restrictive abortion laws, particularly in red states, is a real concern for many, and the impact on poor women's access to abortion services is a significant concern.",
    " Title: Hobby Lobby Allegedly Fires Pregnant Employee, Denies Rehiring After Maternity Leave\n\nArticle:\n\nHobby Lobby, a well-known arts and crafts retailer, has been accused of firing a pregnant employee after she requested time off to give birth, despite earlier assurances that her job would be waiting for her upon her return. The allegations were made by former employee Felicia Allen in a report by RH Reality Check.\n\nAllen, who started working at Hobby Lobby as a part-time cashier in 2010, discovered she was pregnant shortly after joining the company. Concerned about her job security due to her short tenure and her impending maternity leave, Allen asked her supervisor if her job would be safe. The supervisor reportedly reassured her, stating that she would still have her job upon her return.\n\nHowever, when Allen was ready to have her child, she was terminated. She attempted to return to work three weeks after giving birth but was not rehired as promised. \"I was like, I can't get fired,\" Allen told RH Reality Check. \"She can't terminate me because I have to go have my child. I started asking everybody on the job, 'Can they do this?' And even the assistant manager who had just got hired [said], 'No, that's not right.'\"\n\nIn addition to being misled about her ability to return to work, Allen claimed that Hobby Lobby contested her unemployment benefits. According to Allen, the company argued that she could have taken personal leave but chose not to. Allen eventually won her claim, but she left her experience at Hobby Lobby feeling that the company had discriminated against her due to her pregnancy.\n\nAllen could not file a legal challenge due to a contract she signed with Hobby Lobby, which waived her right to sue. Most disputes with the company are settled outside of court in arbitration, according to RH Reality Check's report.\n\nAlex Colvin, a professor of conflict resolution at Cornell University and an expert on employment arbitration, told RH Reality Check that corporations often institute an arbitration-only policy to avoid widespread lawsuits and to keep information on disputes out of the public eye.\n\nSeveral employees have filed job discrimination lawsuits against Hobby Lobby in the past, alleging age, disability, race, and sex discrimination. However, due to the company's avoidance of lawsuits and the confidential nature of arbitration cases, it is difficult to evaluate Hobby Lobby's treatment of its employees beyond the company's assurances that they are paid above minimum wage and well taken care of.\n\nIn a promotional video on the Hobby Lobby website, company president Steve Green stated that the company's pro-family Christian principles guide its operations. \"The beliefs that we've had\u2014that we have grown up with all our lives\u2014are convictions that we have that we live by personally,\" Green said. \"As we have run our business, we feel the obligation or the desire that we want to use those same principles within our business.\"\n\nHobby Lobby has not yet responded to a request for comment regarding the allegations made by Felicia Allen. It remains to be seen how the Green family, who are known for their pro-family Christian principles, will respond to these allegations of discrimination against a new mother.",
    " Title: U.S. Court Temporarily Halts DAPA Program Implementation, Leaves DACA in Place\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States District Court for the Southern Division of Texas has issued a temporary injunction, preventing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from implementing any aspects of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans or Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. This action halts the planned expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was scheduled to begin accepting new applications this week, and may not begin accepting DAPA applications as planned in May.\n\nThe court's order does not affect the existing DACA program, which remains in place. The temporary injunction is intended to preserve the status quo until a more comprehensive court hearing can rule on the merits of the case. To secure a temporary injunction, the plaintiffs must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the DAPA Memorandum violated the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\nThe court's order only affects the DAPA expansion outlined in the November 2014 DAPA Memorandum and the larger DAPA program. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the order, with the appeal likely to be heard by a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals around July or August of this year. If the Obama administration loses this ruling, it could then appeal for an en banc ruling from the 5th Circuit before appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe earliest the Supreme Court might hear the case is March 2016, and the earliest they could issue a decision would be June 2016. This timing poses a significant problem for the Obama administration, as USCIS was expected to begin accepting DAPA application fees to fund their new Crystal City office in May 2015.\n\nThe temporary injunction's impact on the DHS funding debate in Congress remains uncertain. Speaker John Boehner has issued a statement urging Senate Democrats who have questioned the legality of Obama's amnesty to allow debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security department. This statement is a direct challenge to Senators who have voted to prevent any debate on the House Department of Homeland Security bill that defunds Obama's amnesty programs.\n\nSince the order leaves the existing DACA program in place while preventing the new DAPA program from being implemented, a compromise could potentially be reached where the DHS bill continues to defund the DAPA program, but Democratic Senators could offer amendments preserving the DACA program. Moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has suggested such a compromise.",
    " Title: Senate Cancels Half of Summer Recess to Pursue President Trump's Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has abruptly canceled nearly half of the Senate's summer vacation, forcing lawmakers to remain in Washington to make progress on President Trump's agenda. The decision comes as the Senate faces a backlog of presidential nominations and a lengthy to-do list that includes passing a budget, repealing Obamacare, and beginning work on tax reform.\n\nIn a statement, McConnell cited the need to address the Senate's backlog of presidential nominations, which has grown due to unprecedented obstruction by Democrats. He stated, \"We're getting zero cooperation on the personnel part of the Senate's portfolio, which is confirming nominations.\"\n\nThe decision to cancel vacation is a significant shift for lawmakers who value their time away from Washington. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said, \"I don't believe the Senate should go home if we haven't done our job.\"\n\nThe Senate has abbreviated vacations in the past, usually when Congress is facing an immediate spending deadline that could result in a government shutdown. Giving up two weeks of summer vacation to pursue a broader policy agenda is rare.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) criticized the move, stating that Republicans are trying to mask their legislative failures. He said, \"They're struggling with health care. They don't want to go home and face their constituents.\"\n\nDemocrats have erected obstacles to the quick approval of most of Trump's nominees, forcing the Senate to spend floor time on repeated filibuster votes. As of now, Trump has submitted 178 nominations, but only 46 of them have been confirmed. This is significantly lower than the number of nominees confirmed by President Obama at the same point in his first term.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) did not see the recess announcement as a desperation move. He said, \"I have no problem with it whatsoever. I would have liked to [have] stayed in last week, quite honestly, to have greater input in terms of what the final Senate bill was.\"\n\nSenators returned to Capitol Hill on Monday after a 10-day break to celebrate Independence Day. They had been scheduled to leave Capitol Hill on July 28 and return after Labor Day. The new schedule keeps them in Washington until Aug. 11.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have not yet said whether they will follow suit, but they are under increasing pressure from conservatives who say Congress must work through the summer. The House Freedom Caucus issued a statement saying, \"It is imperative that the additional weeks are coupled with decisive action.\"\n\nConservative activists hope that adding more time to the schedule will help break Democrats' resistance. Rick Manning, president of the group Americans for Limited Government, said, \"It's time for the Democrats' collective temper tantrum to end, and Sen. McConnell must continue to ratchet up the pressure so that President Trump's nominees and agenda have a chance of being considered.\"\n\nSenators plan to spend this week and next rewriting and then debating the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare. After that, McConnell said, they will turn to the annual defense policy bill and then could move to raise the federal government's borrowing limit. Analysts say that must be accomplished by October.\n\nCongress also faces a Sept. 30 deadline to approve funding for basic government operations in fiscal year 2018, and Republicans need to pass a new budget to streamline the process for tax reform, which House leaders are planning this year.",
    " Title: Democrats Lose Senate Majority in 2014 Midterm Elections: A Look at the Factors Influencing the Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, the Senate majority that Democrats had held for the past six years under President Barack Obama's leadership was lost. The Democrats' inability to capitalize on opportunities and cope with anticipated challenges led to their defeat.\n\nDuring a late October lunch, President Obama and Senator Chuck Schumer discussed the closely contested Senate races. However, Schumer, representing New York, declined Obama's offer to campaign in battleground states. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) had already suggested Obama make robocalls and radio interviews to help mobilize black voters but had not proposed visits to these states.\n\nThe Democrats faced a challenging map, with Obama himself referring to it as \"the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower.\" They also faced the \"six-year itch\" of Obama's second term, during which the president's party traditionally experiences significant losses.\n\nState-by-state, the Democrats struggled. There were disputes over the Democratic candidate in South Dakota, recruitment issues in Montana, a flawed candidate in Iowa, and a weak Republican in Georgia who still managed to embrace outsourcing. The Republicans, on the other hand, benefited from a simple message: a vote for them was a vote against Obama.\n\nDespite these challenges, Senate Democrats could have fared worse if not for investments in field operations, bringing digital and research operations in-house, hiring key Obama campaign hands, and some luck with GOP candidate struggles in Michigan and Oregon.\n\nRepublicans also capitalized on opposition research, uncovering plagiarism allegations against Democratic Senator John Walsh in Montana. In addition, the National Republican Senatorial Committee's message to protect incumbents and their success in Mississippi and Wyoming was well-received.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to escape the association with Obama was a significant factor in their losses. The Obamacare website debacle, scandals at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the rise of ISIL, the Ebola epidemic, the tidal wave of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border, and the crisis over Russia's actions in Ukraine kept Obama at the center of the news, a position that Democrats on Capitol Hill did not want him in.\n\nGuy Cecil, the DSCC's executive director, acknowledged that the individual issues and tactics the Democrats responded to effectively put the president back in the center of the conversation and nationalized the election.\n\nAt the White House, officials expressed frustration with the Senate Democrats, who they felt were too timid and mishandled their relationship with Obama. Candidates, on the other hand, were criticized for trying to distance themselves from the president while still relying on his base for support.\n\nProminent Democrats outside the White House criticized the administration for being out of touch, arguing that the White House political office was more of a scheduling and email text clearinghouse than a strategy center. They were grateful for Obama's fundraising efforts but felt that the White House could have done more to support the Democrats' campaigns.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with key Democratic and Republican officials involved in the decision-making that helped Republicans regain the Senate majority for the first time in eight years. They told the same story in the closing days of the races: This midterm cycle was run largely out of Washington, and was defined by missed opportunities.",
    " Title: Trump to Impose Tariffs on $200 Billion in Chinese Goods as Early as Next Week\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to impose duties on approximately $200 billion more worth of Chinese goods as early as next week, a senior administration official confirmed on Saturday. This move escalates the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe White House could announce on Monday or Tuesday that it will impose a 10 percent tariff rate on the $200 billion list of goods, the official told \u2588\u2588\u2588. However, these tariffs could reach as high as 25 percent, as Trump proposed last month to increase the tariff rate.\n\nThe administration has threatened these tariffs for months as a response to China's policies that have resulted in intellectual property theft or mandated technology transfers on U.S. companies doing business there. A public comment period on Trump's latest set of tariffs formally ended last week, clearing the way for the president to follow through on the threat.\n\nIn recent months, the administration has typically conducted an analysis of public comments before implementing announced tariffs, which currently affect about $53 billion in Chinese imports. However, Trump's remarks in recent weeks have indicated that he does not want to delay his plan.\n\nPressure from American businesses may have influenced the administration to moderate its approach slightly in the latest round. Many businesses had urged Trump to consider the effects of the tariffs on consumers, especially ahead of the retail holiday season.\n\n\"Continuing the tit-for-tat tariff escalation with China only serves to expand the harm to more U.S. economic interests, including farmers, families, businesses, and workers,\" the National Retail Federation and 150 other business groups said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this month.\n\nTrump has also threatened to impose tariffs on virtually all $505 billion that the United States imports from China. \"I hate to say that, but behind that, there\u2019s another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One last week.\n\nTrump kept up his tough talk on China earlier this week even as his administration and Chinese leaders planned to resume trade talks later this month. \"We are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet, we meet?\" Trump posted on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nA White House spokeswoman on Friday confirmed that Trump intended to move ahead with the tariffs in response to a Bloomberg report that said Trump had instructed aides to prepare to impose them. \"The President has been clear that he and his administration will continue to take action to address China\u2019s unfair trade practices. We encourage China to address the long-standing concerns raised by the United States,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said on Friday.\n\nWalters said Saturday she had no further comment at this time.\n\nBeijing has threatened to retaliate with tariffs ranging from 5 to 25 percent on an additional $60 billion in U.S. products as soon as the Chinese tariffs are imposed. So far, China has responded in kind to Trump's tariffs \u2013 imposing an equivalent $53 billion in tariffs on U.S. exports to China, much of which has been U.S. agricultural goods. However, the U.S. exports only about $130 billion in U.S. goods, meaning China could have to look beyond tariffs to retaliate against Trump's latest trade action.\n\nNews of Trump's plans to proceed on tariffs on $200 billion in goods as early as next week was first reported by The Washington Post.",
    " Title: Award-Winning Photographer and Pediatrician Killed in Afghanistan, Increased Violence Against Foreign Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past less than three weeks, two high-profile foreign workers have been killed in Afghanistan. Award-winning photographer Anja Niedringhaus, a German citizen, was shot and killed by a police officer at a checkpoint in eastern Afghanistan. Her colleague, Canadian reporter Kathy Gannon, who has covered Afghanistan and Pakistan for The Associated Press for decades, was also wounded in the attack. A month prior, a Swedish journalist was shot and killed in a heavily guarded area of Kabul.\n\nThese attacks bear a resemblance to insider attacks by Afghan security forces against their Western allies that became a crisis two years ago. The violence, also known as insider attacks, threatened the military training mission at the heart of the American troop withdrawal scheduled for this year. However, as international coalition soldiers have increasingly confined themselves to their bases, and as new strategies have been implemented to safeguard against insider attacks, such episodes have seemed to subside. Instead, foreign workers in Afghanistan have been targeted. Although the number of Western civilians targeted is still small compared to the number of military deaths, and both together are greatly outstripped by Afghan civilian casualties in the war.\n\nBefore the presidential voting on April 5, a concerted effort by the Taliban to target locations popular with expatriates was evident. An assault in January on a restaurant in central Kabul, the Taverna du Liban, left 21 people dead, most of them foreigners. Shootings at the luxury Serena Hotel last month killed nine. Such events have put the thousands of foreigners living in Kabul on high alert.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the violence has prompted some embassies to redouble their security efforts, and has led those living outside secure areas to limit their exposure.\n\nDr. Jerry Umanos, a pediatrician from Chicago, was one of the recent victims. Friends and colleagues said that he was keenly aware of the risks but was drawn to working with Afghans and helping to teach a new generation of doctors in the country.\n\n\"He was a very good teacher and clinician,\" said Robert F. Werner, who for a time lived in the same house as Dr. Umanos in Afghanistan, in a telephone interview on Thursday. \"And he also had a great sense of humor, so culturally, he just did well. The doctors loved working with him.\"",
    " Title: CNN's Jim Acosta and MSNBC's Joe Scarborough Praise President Trump's D-Day Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, two of President Donald Trump's most vocal mainstream media critics, CNN's Jim Acosta and MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, commended the President's speech on the 75th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nFollowing the speech, Acosta, a White House correspondent for CNN, praised Trump's remarks on the Allied fighters who stormed the beaches of Normandy, stating, \"This is perhaps the most on-message moment of Donald Trump's presidency today. We were all wondering if he would veer from his remarks, go off of his script, but he stayed on script, stayed on message, and, I think, rose to the moment.\"\n\nAcosta's praise for Trump comes amidst controversy surrounding his role at CNN. His book, \"The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America,\" is set to be released soon and is described as an \"explosive, first-hand account of the dangers [Acosta] faces reporting on the current White House while fighting on the front lines in President Trump's war on truth.\"\n\nAcosta, who has been criticized for blurring the line between reporter and pundit, was recently named the media member who \"hates\" Trump the most by authors L. Brent Bozell III and Tim Graham of the Media Research Center in their book \"Unmasked \u2014 Big Media's War Against Trump.\"\n\nOn MSNBC, Scarborough, another frequent Trump critic, echoed Acosta's sentiments. He described Trump's speech as \"the strongest speech of his presidency\" and noted that it was a \"beautiful moment\" when Trump acknowledged the sacrifices of the D-Day heroes.\n\nViewers on both liberal networks were likely taken aback, as Acosta and Scarborough typically criticize Trump's actions. Scarborough, who shares the second spot on the list of media members who clearly loathe the president with his \"Morning Joe\" co-host Mika Brzezinski, had nothing but positive remarks about Trump's D-Day speech.",
    " Title: NSA Taps into Google and Yahoo Data Networks, Alleges Washington Post Report\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from the Washington Post alleges that the National Security Agency (NSA) has secretly tapped into the unencrypted links behind massive cloud networks operated by companies like Google and Yahoo. This alleged activity allows the NSA to collect data at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts, including emails, videos, and audio from American citizens.\n\nThe operation, known as Operation MUSCULAR, is a joint program between the NSA and its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). The program reportedly relies on an unnamed telecommunications provider outside of the U.S. to offer secret access to a cable or switch through which Google and Yahoo pass unencrypted traffic between their servers.\n\nGoogle and Yahoo have stated that their massive servers are carefully guarded and strictly audited. Google claims that buildings housing its servers are guarded around the clock by trained personnel, secured with heat-sensitive cameras, biometric verification, and more.\n\nTwo engineers with close ties to Google reportedly exploded in profanity upon seeing a drawing of the NSA's hack, which was revealed by Edward Snowden. The drawing includes a smiley face next to the point at which the agency apparently tapped into the world's data.\n\nWhite House officials and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, declined to confirm, deny, or explain why the agency allegedly infiltrates Google and Yahoo networks overseas. However, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander said Wednesday that the agency does not access such networks' servers without a court order.\n\nThe NSA also released a statement saying the agency only uses attorney general-approved processes in data collection. \"NSA has multiple authorities that it uses to accomplish its mission, which is centered on defending the nation,\" the statement reads. \"The Washington Post's assertion that we use Executive Order 12333 collection to get around the limitations imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and FAA 702 is not true. The assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data from this type of collection is also not true.\"\n\nIn a statement, Google said it was \"troubled by allegations of the government intercepting traffic between our data centers, and we are not aware of this activity.\" Google also stated that it continues to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links.\n\nYahoo reportedly said, \"We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency.\"\n\nIn an interview in June, President Obama stated \"unequivocally\" that the NSA cannot and has not listened to the telephone calls nor targeted the emails of a U.S. person.\n\nRead more about the latest developments in the NSA spying scandal at the Washington Post.",
    " Title: US States Lift Lockdown Orders as Coronavirus Cases Remain High\n\nArticle:\n\nMore U.S. states are beginning to lift lockdown orders, despite warnings from U.S. leaders that social distancing guidelines will be necessary throughout the summer. Governors have cautioned that life will not quickly return to normal, and that restrictions will remain in some places to prevent the virus from resurging.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. saw its largest single-day spike in cases. As of Tuesday, the U.S. has over 994,000 recorded coronavirus cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, and more than 56,700 deaths. Public health experts warn that lifting restrictions too soon could cause a second wave of infections.\n\nThe decision to end mandatory orders comes as over 26 million Americans seek unemployment protection, and the jobless rate climbs to around 16% of the population. Even as state governors allow orders to expire, some city mayors have issued their own separate plans to end local lockdown rules.\n\nAt one point, over 90% of the U.S. population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but some states began lifting orders over the weekend, allowing some Americans to return to hair salons and tattoo parlors. Georgia, Oklahoma, Alaska, and South Carolina have already allowed some businesses to reopen. They, along with other states, have issued plans that call for more rules to be relaxed in the coming week.\n\nColorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis has said kerb-side retail pickup can begin on Monday, with hair salons, barbershops, and tattoo parlors allowed to reopen on Friday. Tennessee will allow restaurants to reopen on Monday, the same day that Mississippi's mandatory lockdown order expires. Montana's governor has allowed churches to reopen starting on Sunday, with social distancing measures still required. Restaurants and schools will be allowed to reopen on 7 May.\n\nEight states led by Republican governors - Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming - never issued mandatory orders to stay at home. Michigan's Democratic governor, who has angered protesters with her lockdown orders, told ABC News that it is too early to lift mandatory orders in the state.\n\n\"We've got to be nimble and we have to follow the science and be really smart about how we reengage,\" said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Despite a state-wide order to stay-at-home in California, thousands of people have flocked to beaches amid a heat wave.\n\nBut officials in both Ventura and Orange Counties, where beaches are open, said most people were adhering to social distancing guidelines, including staying 6ft (2m) apart. Many beaches are still closed, leading the sheriff of LA County to warn beach-goers that \"enforcement is in full effect.\"\n\nTexas' governor said he will not renew the state's stay-at-home order when it expires on 30 April because it \"has done its job.\" Republican Greg Abbott said on Monday that retail business, as well as restaurants, cinemas, and malls can reopen - but at only 25% capacity - starting on Friday. Barbershops, hair salons, pubs, and gyms can not reopen until later in May, the governor said.\n\nOhio Republican Governor Mike DeWine, who has been praised for his virus response, said that non-essential surgery that does not require an overnight hospital stay can resume on 1 May. On 4 May, offices can reopen, and on 12 May, retail business can resume. \"These are first steps,\" Mr. DeWine said. \"We've got to get moving.\"\n\nOn Sunday, White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said social distancing will remain the norm \"through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another as we move through these phases.\" Her comments come after Vice-President Mike Pence said the virus would be largely \"behind us\" by the 25 May Memorial Day holiday, which signals the unofficial start of summertime in the U.S.\n\nDr. Birx told Fox News this weekend that new cases and deaths \"will be dramatically decreased by the end of May.\" On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo suggested some parts of his state could begin to reopen after the current stay-at-home order expires on 15 May. The governor said that transmission rates, as well as death rates, would dictate how and when the state reopens.\n\nHe urged local officials to follow national health guidelines for reopening and work together regionally, saying: \"You have to be smart about it - we all have to be smart about it.\" Mr. Cuomo also noted he would extend restrictions in many parts of the state. There are still 1,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed each day in New York. The death rate has dropped in New York, with 337 deaths on Sunday, compared to 367 deaths on Saturday and 437 on Friday. It represents the lowest increase since 30 March.",
    " Title: Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down North Carolina's Voting Restrictions, Citing Discriminatory Intent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant judicial decision, a federal appeals court has struck down North Carolina's voting restrictions, which were some of the strictest in the nation. The ruling comes after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Texas's Voter ID laws and a federal district court placed an injunction against Wisconsin's.\n\nDale Ho, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer who argued the case in North Carolina, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"This is a huge victory.\" He added, \"The tide is turning.\"\n\nThe new voting restrictions, as reported in February, were set to block over 1.3 million voters in four swing states\u2014Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014primarily by eliminating early voting periods and requiring specific forms of identification.\n\nNorth Carolina's 2016 law affected more than 1.2 million people. Over 900,000 people utilized early voting in 2012, 130,000 used same-day registration in 2008, and more than 200,000 registered voters do not have driver's licenses. As of today, those votes are back in play.\n\nIn the 2008 and 2012 elections, Barack Obama won the state by 15,000 votes, and Mitt Romney won by 117,000 votes.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals did not just strike down North Carolina's new rules. The three-judge panel wrote an opinion filled with fiery rhetoric that condemned the state legislature for acting with discriminatory intent. The opinion noted that \"after years of preclearance and expansion of voting access, by 2013 African American registration and turnout rates had finally reached near-parity with white registration and turnout rates. African Americans were poised to act as a major electoral force.\"\n\nHowever, the court found that after the Supreme Court ruled that part of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, the state \"requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans.\"\n\nThe court's opinion is unusually strong, both in ordinary language and in legalese. It's not just that North Carolina's law happens to affect communities of color\u2014the Court found that it was intended to do so all along.\n\nThis is different from the Fifth Circuit's finding that Texas's Voter ID law had a disparate impact on minority communities. It's actually calling out North Carolina for racial discrimination.\n\nHo explained, \"Discriminatory intent means singling out a group on the basis of race and trying to disadvantage them on that basis. It doesn't matter if you hate black voters, or don't like how black voters vote. If you're targeting them, that is discrimination.\"\n\nThe court found that North Carolina did exactly that. Inventing a voter fraud crisis that didn't exist, the state \"required in-person voters to show certain photo IDs, beginning in 2016, which African Americans disproportionately lacked, and eliminated or reduced registration and voting access tools that African Americans disproportionately used.\"\n\nAll this correlation, the court ruled, couldn't be an accident. There was no smoking gun\u2014no careless comment about disenfranchising black voters\u2014but the way the gun was loaded, aimed, and fired left no doubt about the law's purpose.\n\n\"The only clear factor linking these various'reforms' is their impact on African American voters,\" the court held. \"The record thus makes obvious that the'problem' the majority in the General Assembly sought to remedy was emerging support for the minority party.\"\n\nThe cases in Wisconsin, Texas, and North Carolina represent a sea change in judicial opinion about voting restrictions. With challenges pending in Ohio, Virginia, and Kansas, it seems like voter suppression's days may be numbered.\n\nHo told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that public opinion is shifting as well. \"When these laws first got passed, people thought 'what's the big deal\u2014I have ID.' But the truth is that while 90 percent of us do have ID, 10 percent don't... and it's those folks that these laws target.

    " Title: Polls Show Tight Race in Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin as Obama and Romney-Ryan Ticket Narrowly Leads\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to the latest polls from Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times, the presidential race between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney remains close in three critical battleground states: Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The polls indicate that Obama has a slight edge in each state, with 49% of likely voters supporting him in Florida, 50% in Ohio, and 49% in Wisconsin, compared to 46%, 44%, and 47% for Romney, respectively.\n\nThe polls show only a slight boost for Romney since he named Paul Ryan as his running mate at the beginning of August. In Florida, support for Romney increased by one percentage point, while in Wisconsin, it increased by two percentage points. The Ohio numbers remained unchanged from a Quinnipiac University survey taken prior to the Paul Ryan announcement.\n\nPeter A. Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, stated in a statement accompanying the poll's release, \"Gov. Mitt Romney's pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has made some small difference in Florida and Wisconsin, at least at this point, when voters in these three key states are asked about their presidential vote.\"\n\nCompared to Vice President Joe Biden, Ryan is seen in a more favorable light. In Florida, Ryan has a 29% unfavorable rating, compared to 44% for Biden. In Ohio, 27% of voters have an unfavorable impression of Ryan, compared to 40% for Biden. And in Wisconsin, Ryan's home state, the GOP vice presidential candidate has a 35% unfavorable rating, compared to 42% for Biden.\n\nWhen voters assess the qualifications of the running mates to become president, Biden is only slightly ahead in Florida and Ohio, and slightly behind Ryan in Wisconsin. In fact, Ryan's qualified/unqualified ratio is better than Biden's.\n\nMedicare, the government-run health care program for senior citizens, is a popular issue in all three states. The issue surfaced as a major issue on the presidential campaign trail when Romney named Ryan as his running mate, since Ryan has proposed a plan in the House that would allow private insurers to compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange.\n\nThursday's polls showed a majority of voters in the three battleground states saying they thought Medicare should continue operating the way it currently does, with the government providing insurance to seniors. Strong majorities also said they thought Medicare was worth the cost to taxpayers.\n\n\"By more than 4-1 margins, voters in each state say the health care program for the elderly is worth the cost and six in 10 say they favor keeping the current Medicare model,\" Brown wrote. \"But 10% of voters in each state would support'major reductions' in Medicare to reduce the deficit and almost 50% would support'minor reductions.'\"\n\nThe Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll was conducted by telephone between August 15 \u2013 21. In Florida, 1,241 likely voters were polled; in Ohio, 1,253 were polled, and in Wisconsin, 1,190 were polled. The sampling error in all three states was plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.\n\nReaders are encouraged to check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out their own strategy for November.",
    " Title: Illinois Voter Challenges Ted Cruz's Eligibility for Presidency in Court\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Illinois voter, Lawrence Joyce, will have his case heard in the Circuit Court of Cook County in Chicago on Friday, alleging that Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz is not a \"natural-born citizen\" and should be disqualified for the party's nomination. Joyce, a pharmacist and attorney from Poplar Grove, Ill, has objected to Cruz's placement on the Illinois primary ballot next month.\n\nJoyce's previous objection, made to the state's Board of Elections, was dismissed on February 1. He appealed the decision and was granted a hearing for Friday before Judge Maureen Ward Kirby. Joyce challenges Cruz's right to be president in the wake of questions put forth by GOP rival Donald Trump about being born in Canada. Cruz maintains he is a natural-born citizen since his mother is American-born.\n\nRepublican contender Ben Carson has reportedly shown no interest in pursuing the matter, according to Joyce, who said he raised the issue with the Carson campaign. If Cruz wins the GOP nomination, Democrat Congressman Alan Grayson of Florida has threatened to file a lawsuit contesting Cruz's citizenship.\n\nJoyce said he was hesitant to file the lawsuit out of concern that getting involved in such a high-profile case could be detrimental to his own law practice. \"I tried to talk myself out of it and was unable to do so,\" Joyce said. \"It's plain as day that Ted Cruz is not a natural-born citizen of the United States.\"\n\nCruz, at a CNN-hosted town hall meeting Wednesday night, defended his citizenship and right to run, saying he was born in Canada to a U.S. citizen, making him an automatic U.S. citizen. His mother was born in Wilmington, Del., Cruz said.\n\n\"I never breathed a breath of air on this planet when I was not a U.S. citizen,\" he said. \"It was the act of being born that made me a U.S. citizen.\" Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler had no comment about the lawsuit, and the Trump campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nA federal lawsuit was filed in Texas last month asking for a determination of Cruz's eligibility to run. Voters in New York, who raised similar concerns about Cruz's citizenship, on Thursday filed a challenge with the state Board of Election challenging the senator's eligibility to be on the ballot.\n\nConstitutional law professor Sanford Levinson of the University of Texas School of Law said Joyce would have to prove standing \u2013 or why Cruz's potential ineligibility affects him specifically \u2013 for the judge to proceed with the case. Even if the judge declares Cruz to be ineligible to run, the GOP candidate's campaign would undoubtedly file an appeal, potentially tying the case up for months.\n\nIt's surprising that a lower court would even agree to hear the case, which is entangled in broader constitutional issues, Sanford said. \"I'd be very, very surprised if [the judge] were to say he's ineligible,\" he said. \"At that point, all hell would break loose.\"",
    " Title: Libertarian Party Ticket Gains Momentum as General Election Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Libertarian Party ticket, consisting of nominee Gary Johnson and running mate William Weld, is experiencing a surge in support as the 2016 U.S. presidential election enters its final stages. This surge in interest could potentially place Johnson on the highly coveted debate stage this fall.\n\nDespite the unpopularity of the Republican and Democratic candidates, few anticipate the Libertarian ticket to pose a significant threat akin to Ross Perot's 1992 campaign. However, the party is garnering attention due to rumors of high-profile Republicans considering their support, a well-received video from Johnson and Weld, and polls showing Johnson receiving close to 15 percent, the threshold required to secure a place on the debate stage alongside Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average, Johnson is currently at 8.4 percent in a four-way race that includes Trump, Clinton, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. This is an increase from 4.5 percent in June. The latest poll, released on Wednesday, places Johnson at 12 percent. An NBC poll taken during the Democratic convention placed Johnson at 9 percent, a level consistent with prior polling.\n\nNicholas Sarwark, chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, stated that the unpopularity of the Republican and Democratic candidates provides the party with an \"unprecedented opportunity.\" Sarwark emphasized that Johnson's record as a two-term New Mexico governor, who was re-elected as a Republican in a Democratic state, strengthens his credentials and appeal.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether the polling support will translate into votes at the ballot box. In 2012, Johnson won just 0.99 percent of all votes cast, making him the most successful White House candidate in Libertarian history, but not making a significant impact on the overall race.\n\nThis year, there are indications that more voters are seeking an alternative candidate. At the Democratic convention last week, many Bernie Sanders supporters expressed support for the Green Party's Jill Stein. However, Johnson is currently polling better among third-party candidates.\n\nJohnson and Weld generated buzz before the conventions with a slick video ad highlighting their accomplishments. Johnson stated in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that he believes the Libertarian stance on social issues and foreign policy could attract Sanders voters.\n\nSarwark stated that the party is banking on the fact that while Trump and Clinton are well-known, Johnson still has an opportunity to introduce himself to voters unfamiliar with his story, particularly if he is able to secure a place on the debate stage.\n\nCurrently, Johnson's support is higher than in past years, but an 8.4 percent average is still a significant distance from the 15 percent he would need to make the debates. Johnson has until the middle of September to reach 15 percent in not just one poll but an average of five recent polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\n\"Politically, where we stand, is we have to get into those presidential debates to really stand a chance,\" Weld told The Wall Street Journal last week. \"If we catch a break or two, we may get there.\"\n\nEven if Johnson reaches the 15 percent threshold, the historical record for third-party or independent candidates is not strong. In recent political history, the one who came closest to the presidency was businessman Ross Perot in 1992, who was an independent, not technically a third-party candidate. At one point, Perot led in some polls against then-President George H.W. Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. However, after dropping out of the race before re-entering, he lost support and eventually garnered 19 percent of the vote. Some Republicans argue that Perot split the GOP vote and handed the election to Clinton.\n\nRepublicans were arguably given a boost by Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, when Nader picked up 2.7 percent of the vote against Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush. Johnson's potential impact is difficult to gauge, but the latest poll found Johnson siphoning support about equally from the Democratic and GOP candidates. Johnson could receive a boost in the coming weeks as some Republicans reportedly consider backing him.\n\nMost notably, 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush are reportedly considering endorsements for Johnson. Marvin Bush, youngest brother of Jeb and George W., also endorsed Johnson last week. According to Sarwark, the party is still considering endorsements from the Bush and Romney camps.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Hear Same-Sex Marriage Cases, Encouraging Lower Courts to Uphold Same-Sex Marriage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court declined on Monday to take on the issue of gay marriage, effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in several states. The affected states include Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, which have been instructed to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision not to intervene indicates a preference for lower courts to continue striking down traditional marriage laws across the country. The Court is expected to wait until a majority of states have been compelled to recognize same-sex marriage by lower-level appeals courts before establishing a \"trend-line\" and declaring a new standard.\n\nThe logic behind this approach was previously demonstrated in the 2003 case of Lawrence v. Texas, where the Court waited 17 years to overrule Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), which had criminalized anal sex. In Lawrence v. Texas, the Court stated that the earlier ruling no longer applied due to an \"emerging awareness\" that liberty provides substantial protection for adult persons in matters pertaining to sex.\n\nJustice Scalia, in his dissent, argued that the Court's statement was false, as states still regulate various sexual activities, such as prostitution, adult incest, adultery, obscenity, and child pornography. He also noted that Constitutional entitlements do not arise because some states choose to lessen or eliminate criminal sanctions on certain behavior.\n\nThe Supreme Court's strategy allows lower courts to violate the Constitution, and then declare the Constitution changed due to an \"emerging consensus\" on violating the Constitution. Critics argue that this approach undermines the democratic process, as citizens cannot pass laws that have been fully Constitutional for two and a half centuries, cannot fight state attorneys general who betray their voters, and must endure the courts playing legal games while awaiting the Court's \"evolution\" \u2013 an evolution that is largely top-down and will be dictated to us by our betters.\n\nBen Shapiro, Senior Editor-At-Large of \u2588\u2588\u2588 and author of the book \"The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration,\" has been vocal on this issue. He is also Editor-in-Chief of TruthRevolt.org and can be found on Twitter @benshapiro.",
    " Title: FBI and NCTC Assessment Contradicts CIA Director's Account of Benghazi Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo days after the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) provided briefings to Capitol Hill, stating that the evidence supported an Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda-affiliated attack. This assessment contrasts with the briefing by CIA Director David Petraeus the following day, which described the attack as tied to a demonstration.\n\nThe Sept. 13 assessment by the FBI and NCTC was based on intercepts that included individuals believed to have participated in the attack who were celebratory and a claim of responsibility. The briefings also revealed a series of Al Qaeda training camps just outside of Benghazi, where the attack occurred, and the area was described as a hotbed for the militant group Ansar al-Sharia and Al Qaeda in North Africa. There was no mention of a demonstration or significant emphasis on the anti-Islam video that administration officials had cited as a motivating factor for the attack.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Petraeus characterized the attack as more consistent with a flash mob, where militants showed up spontaneously with RPGs. Petraeus downplayed the skill needed to fire mortars, which were also used in the attack and were seen as evidence of significant pre-planning. As previously reported, four mortars were fired, two of which missed the annex, but the mortar team re-calibrated, and the next two mortars were direct hits.\n\nPetraeus seemed wedded to the narrative that the attack was linked to a demonstration and was spontaneous as opposed to pre-meditated. Petraeus was \"absolute\" in his description with few, if any, caveats. As lawmakers learned more about the attack, including through raw intelligence reports, they were \"angry, disappointed, and frustrated\" that the CIA director had not provided a more complete picture of the available intelligence.\n\nReached for comment, a spokesperson for the NCTC referred \u2588\u2588\u2588 to the Sept. 28 statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which said the assessment changed to indicate that it did not stem from a protest but rather was deliberate and organized.\n\nA U.S. intelligence official disputed the characterization of Petraeus' briefing to lawmakers on Sept. 14, saying: \"The first briefing (to the Hill) carefully laid out the full range of sparsely available information, with briefers noting that extremists -- including those with possible links to AQIM and Ansar al-Sharia -- were involved in attacks that appeared spontaneous.\"\n\nAs for the current assessment of the Benghazi attack, a U.S. intelligence official said no one is ruling out the idea that militants may have aspired to attack the U.S., though the bulk of available information supports the early assessment that extremists, with ties to al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia, did not plan the attacks for days or weeks in advance.\n\nOne source who heard Petraeus brief also told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"I can confirm that he explicitly stated both to the House and the Senate oversight committees that members of AQIM and AAS participated in the attack in Benghazi. That assessment still stands.\"\n\nIntelligence officials have given a mixed picture of what happened that day, acknowledging that an investigation is underway. The office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper last month acknowledged the strike was a coordinated terror attack, but officials have subsequently said the strike could have been opportunistic, taking their cue from protests over the film in Egypt. Still, some point to the use of mortars and several other strands of evidence to claim the attack involved some premeditation.",
    " Title: Violence Erupts in Cairo as Egyptian Security Forces Disperse Muslim Brotherhood Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nEgyptian security forces, utilizing armored cars, bulldozers, tear gas, and automatic weapons, cleared two protest camps in Cairo established by supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi on Wednesday. The clashes resulted in hundreds of casualties, with at least 149 deaths and over 1,400 injuries, according to the Egyptian government.\n\nThe smaller camp, located at Nahda Square near Cairo University, was cleared within hours, as reported by The New York Times. However, protesters at the larger camp around the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in the northeastern suburb of Nasr City continued to engage in battles with police forces into the morning.\n\nEgypt's interim government issued a statement expressing sorrow over the bloodshed. In a statement on state-run TV, a spokesman attributed the violence to the Muslim Brotherhood and urged protesters to refrain from using violence. The spokesman also warned that authorities would not tolerate any attempts to attack state buildings or police stations.\n\nOfficials had long warned that they would move to disperse the protest camps, and protesters had been preparing for the anticipated crackdown. The New York Times reported that some protesters were throwing Molotov cocktails and broken paving stones, while military snipers targeted demonstrators.\n\nThere were conflicting reports regarding the number of casualties. Western reporters at several morgues and hospitals observed dozens of dead protesters with gunshot wounds to the head and chest, suggesting that authorities were shooting to kill. Muslim Brotherhood leaders claimed that hundreds had been killed by indiscriminate fire from soldiers and police, while the authorities reported approximately a dozen deaths, including two police officers.\n\nWednesday's events are likely to widen the divide between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and secularists and religious minorities who largely supported the military's July 3 ouster of Morsi, following mass protests against his rule. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a human rights group, reported that the crackdown had already spurred attacks by Brotherhood supporters against Coptic Christian churches in southern Egypt.",
    " Title: Stephen Moore Shares Insights on Trump's Impact on Republican Party and Future Conservatism\n\nArticle:\n\nStephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Donald Trump, has stated that Trump's victory has shifted the Republican Party into a more populist working-class party. Moore, who was once a doctrinaire libertarian and free-trader, expressed this view in a conversation with House Republicans and in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep.\n\nMoore, an economic consultant with FreedomWorks, a grass-roots organization that helped launch the Tea Party, discussed Trump's plans to revive U.S. manufacturing jobs, being tough with China on trade, and the president-elect's personal business holdings.\n\nRegarding Trump's approach to trade, Moore acknowledged the benefits of free trade but also recognized the impact it has had on certain sectors and regions. He suggested that Trump's tough stance on China and potential negotiations could lead to better deals without resorting to protectionism and raising tariffs.\n\nOn the issue of China's potential leverage over Trump due to his business dealings, Moore expressed doubt, stating that Trump would put his business dealings aside to act in the national interest.\n\nWhen asked about the feasibility of bringing back jobs to industries that peaked decades ago, such as steel and coal, Moore expressed optimism, citing the potential for a better tax system, a better regulatory system, and the U.S.'s competitive advantages in terms of trained workers and low-cost energy.\n\nRegarding the possibility of Trump imposing 35 percent tariffs if he fails to renegotiate trade deals with China and Mexico, Moore expressed opposition to tariffs and hoped that Trump would not resort to this measure. Moore stated that he has tried to push Trump in the right direction on these issues and that Trump has expressed support for free and fair trade.",
    " Title: Minnesota Sen. Al Franken Resigns Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations, Cites President Trump as Part of the Irony\n\nArticle:\n\nMinnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken announced his resignation from the U.S. Senate on Thursday, following a series of sexual misconduct allegations that ranged from groping to forcibly trying to kiss women. In his 11-minute speech, Franken acknowledged some of the complaints against him as \"simply not true\" and that he remembers others \"differently.\"\n\nDuring the announcement, Franken took a parting shot at President Trump, stating, \"There is some irony in the fact that I am leaving office while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.\" Franken was referring to Trump and Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama.\n\nSenators, staff, and family members were present for the announcement, with some sitting stone-faced and others crying. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan was the only Republican senator present. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar were also in attendance, among the lengthy list of Democrats pressuring Franken to resign.\n\nKlobuchar stated, \"As he and I discussed yesterday, this is the right decision.\" Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine had a \"detailed conversation\" with Franken Wednesday evening, and stated, \"He did what I suggested -- and he did the right thing -- so I'm just going to leave it there.\"\n\nMinnesota Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton will appoint a successor to fill the remainder of Franken's term until a special election is held in 2018. The likely candidate could be Democratic Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, a close ally of Franken.\n\nThe calls for Franken's resignation began after California radio broadcaster Leeann Tweeden posted a blog detailing how Franken kissed and groped her without her consent in 2006. Since then, seven additional women have come forward with allegations against Franken.\n\nThe latest allegation was from a woman who claimed she was groped at a Media Matters party during the first Obama inauguration. Before that, another woman accused Franken of forcibly trying to kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. The accuser, who was not identified, said Franken tried to kiss her but that she ducked.\n\nThe calls for Franken to step down came after Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., retired following numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against him. In Alabama, several women have accused Moore, the Senate Republican candidate, of sexual misconduct when they were in their teens, including one who said she was 14 when Moore molested her. Trump, who had multiple allegations of sexual harassment against himself when running for president, has endorsed Moore.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Secretary Kelly Clarifies Immigration Policies, Assures \"Dreamers\" of Relative Safety\n\nArticle:\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, clarified the Trump administration's stance on immigration, particularly regarding individuals who are in the country illegally and those protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nMr. Kelly stated that while anyone in the U.S. illegally is subject to deportation by law, the administration is not focusing on \"Dreamers\" shielded by DACA. He explained that the administration's objectives are to secure the Southwest border and to remove those who reside in the U.S. unlawfully and are considered the \"worst\" of the undocumented population.\n\nIn response to recent concerns about mixed messages regarding who is at risk for deportation, Mr. Kelly emphasized that individuals who are simply in the country illegally are not a priority for enforcement. He also stated that illegal immigrants should still report domestic violence and other crimes, as they can usually do so anonymously.\n\nThe administration's immigration policies have been tested in recent weeks, with the case of 23-year-old Juan Manuel Montes, a DACA recipient who was deported to Mexico in February, garnering significant attention. Immigrant rights groups and Democrats have rallied to his cause, but Mr. Kelly has maintained that Mr. Montes gave up his DACA status through \"illegal actions.\"\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) suggested that if President Trump truly wants to protect people, he should stop targeting sanctuary cities that refuse to alert federal officials of illegal immigrants in their custody, allowing undocumented residents to come forward freely when crimes occur. Mr. Durbin also warned against insisting on funding for the border wall with Mexico in a stopgap funding bill, stating it could lead to a government shutdown.\n\nDespite Sen. Durbin's warning, Mr. Kelly gave no indication that President Trump plans to back off the demand for wall funding. Mr. Kelly stated, \"I think it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall. So, I would suspect, he'll do the right thing for sure, but I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding.\"",
    " Title: Libertarian and Green Party Candidates Offer Alternative to Mainstream Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Libertarian Party's candidate, Gary Johnson, and the Green Party's Jill Stein are presenting voters with an alternative to the two main-party nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Here is a comprehensive overview of the two third-party candidates:\n\nGary Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, is the Libertarian candidate. Johnson, who is 63 years old, is a fitness enthusiast who has climbed Mount Everest and is the former CEO of a legal cannabis company. He has long supported marijuana legalization, although he has pledged not to use the drug in the White House if elected. His running mate is another former Republican governor, Bill Weld, from Massachusetts. Both men, while in office, pursued libertarian principles of small government and less regulation, cutting taxes and vetoing spending programs.\n\nJohnson and Weld are campaigning on a traditional libertarian ticket of small government and individual freedom. As fiscal conservatives, they support a single consumption tax and want to scrap the Dodd-Frank law regulating Wall Street. They generally conform to the libertarian belief that government works best by staying out of people's lives, favoring legalizing marijuana and opposing gun restrictions. They initially opposed mandatory vaccinations (though Johnson has since changed his position), and support the right to abortion and gay marriage.\n\nJill Stein, a Harvard-trained physician turned liberal activist, is the Green Party nominee. She is selling herself as the progressive \"Plan B\" for disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Stein, who is 66 years old, echoes many of Sanders' policies, such as a $15-per-hour federal minimum wage, a \"wartime-scale mobilization\" to defeat climate change, a single-payer health-care system, and the abolition of all student debt. However, she goes much further to the left, calling for unilateral nuclear disarmament, a 50 percent cut to the military budget, the elimination of all fossil fuels by 2030, and paying reparations for slavery. Stein has expressed concerns about the safety of vaccinations and Wi-Fi. Her running mate, human rights activist Ajamu Baraka, once called President Obama an \"Uncle Tom\" who has betrayed African-Americans.\n\nThe chances of either Stein or Johnson winning the presidency are close to zero. However, the two main-party nominees, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, are the least liked candidates in the modern political era. Four out of 10 voters think neither would make a good president, leaving the door wide open for Johnson and Stein to attract a significant protest vote. Johnson has climbed to over 10 percent in some polls, and in a four-way matchup against Trump and Clinton, he and Stein together collect up to 14 percent of registered voters. That is enough to affect whether Trump or Clinton wins in some critical swing states.\n\nJohnson could lose support to Trump among Republican \"NeverTrumpers\" who do not view the bombastic businessman as a true conservative, and who are attracted to Johnson's fiscal conservatism and pro\u2013gun rights record. Clinton, on the other hand, could lose votes to Johnson, whose support for marijuana legalization and a rollback of government surveillance appeals to young voters. This has led many Democrats to warn that Johnson and Stein could jointly become the Ralph Nader of the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2000, Nader, the Green Party candidate, pulled thousands of votes in Florida away from Democrat Al Gore, a state George W. Bush won by just 537 votes. That gave the election to Bush, even though he lost the overall popular vote to Gore. This year, if the election proves tighter than polls currently indicate, it is possible that Johnson and Stein could cost Clinton enough votes in a key battleground state or two to alter the outcome of the election. Johnson embraces the idea of being the \"spoiler\" candidate. \"I will lose no sleep if that's the label given to me,\" he says. \"This is a party that needs crashing.\" Stein also rejects the idea that voters must choose \"the lesser evil,\" arguing that Clinton is not a true progressive.\n\nBoth Johnson and Stein are desperate to make it into the first presidential debate, on Sept. 26. However, they face a steep climb. A candidate needs to hit 15 percent in five national polls to make it onto the stage, according to debate commission rules. Johnson is polling at an average of 8.8 percent, while Stein is at 3.4 percent. The two candidates face a classic catch-22: They won't be included until they prove they are competitive in the polls, but cannot compete without the attention and name recognition a prime-time presidential debate would bring. Johnson and Stein are suing the commission for the right to participate. If they were part of the debates, the race might be very different. \"For people to choose Gary Johnson,\" says political operative Roger Stone, an informal adviser to Trump, \"they need to know that he's running.\" In 2012, Stone backed and provided advice to Johnson's first presidential run as a Libertarian, when he won just 1 percent of the vote in the race against President Obama and Mitt Romney. \"There was another choice,\" Stone says, \"it's just that nobody knew about it.\"",
    " Title: Senate Immigration Bill Faces Criticism Over Border Security and Enforcement Discretion\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently released Senate immigration bill, which includes a multibillion-dollar investment in border security, has faced criticism from some quarters over a perceived loophole regarding enforcement discretion. The National ICE Council President, Chris Crane, has expressed dissatisfaction, stating that the bill does not address concerns about the Obama administration's handling of immigration enforcement.\n\nIn a letter to Sen. Marco Rubio, a key member of the bipartisan group of lawmakers drafting the bill, Crane expressed disappointment that the bill does not address the issues he raised. The letter was sent shortly before the bill's formal release.\n\nCrane, who represents the union of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, had long sought a meeting with Rubio to discuss his concerns. In the letter, he thanked Rubio for the meeting but criticized the bill for not addressing his concerns about the enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nCrane's concerns revolve around what he describes as the government's discretion in enforcing immigration laws, a practice that ICE agents have long criticized. The Obama administration has been accused of making the job of ICE agents more difficult by preventing them from detaining and deporting certain illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Senate bill aims to invest billions in border security, with a focus on a security and fencing plan. To address conservative concerns, the bill establishes a set of \"triggers\" that must be met before illegal immigrants currently in the country can apply for a green card. These triggers include the Department of Homeland Security launching a new border security and fencing plan and achieving high levels of apprehension along high-risk areas on the Mexican border.\n\nHowever, Crane has called for the bill to be held until several major issues are addressed, including what he described as \"directives\" that release \"dangerous criminal aliens\" back into the community and the Obama administration's \"dangerous abuse\" of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nThe administration has allowed \"prosecutorial discretion\" to focus on deporting high-risk illegal immigrants. Officials have said that criminal aliens are generally not being released, and that only low-priority individuals are given a reprieve. The administration also issued a directive allowing some illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay.\n\nCritics warn that legalizing the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country without establishing a strict system of interior enforcement will allow the problem to persist. Sen. Jeff Sessions, a prominent critic of the immigration bill, echoed Crane's concerns.\n\nSessions is expected to join Sen. David Vitter for a press conference on the bill Thursday afternoon. The bill is scheduled to come up for its first hearing on Friday. Rubio, like other Republicans, has said the bill should receive a thorough review on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe nearly 900-page bill contains a number of other measures, including a new system of temporary visas for low-skill workers and expanded visas for high-skill workers. Unlike the recently stalled gun control legislation, the immigration bill comes out of the gate with bipartisan backing. Rubio was one of four Republicans drafting the bill, and some other Republicans have expressed a willingness to consider an immigration overhaul.",
    " Title: James O' Keefe Accused of Staging Alleged Sexual Assault Story for Roy Moore\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent revelation by The Washington Post, it has been exposed that conservative filmmaker James O' Keefe, in collaboration with Project Veritas, hired a woman to fabricate a story of an alleged sexual relationship with Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in 1992, which led to an abortion when she was 15.\n\nThe woman, Jaime T. Phillips, shared this dramatic story during a series of interviews over a two-week period. During these interviews, she repeatedly pressed Post reporters for their opinions on the potential impact of her claims on Moore's candidacy if she went public.\n\nHowever, it was later revealed that Phillips was working for O' Keefe and Project Veritas. In essence, O' Keefe hired a woman to lie about sexual assault in an attempt to cast doubt on women who were actually assaulted by Moore.\n\nIn another attempt to deceive the public, O' Keefe claimed he would reveal \"the truth\" including video of a \"confrontation\" with one of the Post reporters who supposedly forced his way into the offices at O' Keefe's Project Veritas. However, it was the Washington Post that was recording the events, including how O' Keefe himself invited the reporter to come to the office.\n\nThe Washington Post sent a team, including reporter Manu Raju and two video reporters, to the Project Veritas offices in Mamaroneck, NY, on Monday morning to determine whether Phillips worked there. They observed Phillips entering the office, and O' Keefe, who appeared minutes later, declined to answer questions. He invited Raju back for an interview shortly after noon.\n\nAs is typical for O' Keefe, what his followers received was a highly edited version of this encounter, designed to make it look like he hadn't been caught not only lying, but lying to aid and abet sexual assault.\n\nVoters in Alabama can support the truth by donating to Doug Jones, allowing him to get the actual truth out to every voter in the state.",
    " Title: Obama Announces Ban on Certain Military-Style Equipment for Police, Emphasizes Community Policing\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has announced a ban on the acquisition of certain military-style equipment by local police departments, stating that such equipment can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message. The announcement was made during a visit to Camden, New Jersey, as part of an effort to ease tensions between police and minority communities in the wake of several high-profile police-involved shootings.\n\nUnder new recommendations, police forces will be prohibited from acquiring equipment such as tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft, and high-caliber weapons and ammunition. The proposal is one of several made by a White House task force, which Obama is implementing through an executive order on Monday.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the White House, the task force weighed the utility of the equipment to local police against its potential negative impact on the community if used arbitrarily or inappropriately. Local police departments can still purchase this equipment independently, but they cannot acquire it from federal agencies or use federal funds for the purchase.\n\nObama's visit to one of New Jersey's poorest cities comes as he seeks to increase federal funding for community policing initiatives in the wake of a series of high-profile incidents that have strained trust between officers and residents in Ferguson, Missouri, New York, and Baltimore, among other cities. Camden has historically been one of New Jersey's most crime-ridden cities, but reforms over the past two years have led to falling crime statistics and an increased number of officers in the community.\n\nThe White House has also outlined several other initiatives that Obama will highlight on Monday, including:\n\n* The Police Data Initiative, which will help police departments across the country track use of force and police stops, with data scientists assisting some departments in refining an early warning system using data to flag potential problems.\n* The release of big data sets by 21 jurisdictions, providing communities with visibility into key information on police/citizen encounters.\n* The release of a body-cam tool kit to help police plan and implement body-camera programs.\n* The Department of Justice will begin accepting applications for grants designed to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement agencies through hiring, training, and technical assistance, the development of innovative community policing strategies, applied research, guidebooks, and best practices that are national in scope.",
    " Title: Former Senator Rick Santorum Announces Second Presidential Bid, Focuses on Immigration and Economic Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania has launched his second bid for the presidency, emphasizing his commitment to working-class Americans and their economic well-being. At a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, Santorum declared his candidacy, stating, \"Working families don't need another president tied to big government or big money. Today is the day we are going to begin to fight back!\"\n\nSantorum, who finished as the runner-up to Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican nomination race, has been open about his desire to re-enter the political arena. Surrounded by his family, he outlined a \"bold\" conservative vision, which includes abolishing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replacing the current tax code with a \"simple, fair, flat tax.\"\n\nHe pledged to cut government spending, repeal executive orders and regulations that cost American jobs, and to advocate for a stronger education system, military members, and pro-life legislation. In terms of foreign policy, Santorum promised a muscular approach and a commitment to protecting American workers who have been affected by the nation's immigration laws.\n\nSantorum criticized the influx of mostly unskilled workers over the past 20 years, stating that it has led to stagnant wages and family incomes. He contrasted his priorities with those of Hillary Clinton and big business, whom he accused of prioritizing profits and power, while his priority is the American worker.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that Santorum's bid for the presidency may face challenges due to the strength of the field and the presence of several fresh faces, such as Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Additionally, religious conservatives will have other candidates to choose from, including Cruz, Carson, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, Santorum gained support from voters before the Iowa caucuses as the anyone-but-Romney candidate. He won the caucuses and a total of 11 nomination contests, benefiting from strong support from born-again or evangelical Christians and the financial backing of Foster Friess, who helped fund the pro-Santorum \"Red, White and Blue Fund\" Super PAC. Friess is supporting Santorum once again and attended his campaign launch.\n\nAn immediate challenge facing Santorum could be qualifying for the first GOP-sanctioned debate on Aug. 6, which will be hosted by Fox News and is limiting participants to the top 10 of an average of national polls. According to the latest Real Clear Politics Average of polls, Santorum is currently running tenth.\n\nSantorum is scheduled to make campaign stops in Iowa and South Carolina this week as part of a \"Take America Back Tour.\"",
    " Title: CNBC Republican Debate Marks Potential End of Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe third Republican debate, held on October 29, 2015, was primarily remembered for two significant factors: CNBC's controversial moderation and the perceived decline of Jeb Bush's presidential campaign. The debate, which was supposed to focus on economic policy, was met with criticism for its slanted nature, factual errors, and a parade of \"gotcha\" questions.\n\nSeveral candidates, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, directly called out the biased coverage during the debate. Co-host John Harwood, who was perceived as tendentious and argumentative, repeatedly interrupted candidates and failed to clarify his factual errors when pushed back upon.\n\nJeb Bush, who has underperformed in the polls, was criticized for his handling of the debate. His attempt to take a hard shot at Marco Rubio's missed Senate votes early in the proceedings was met with a strong counter-punch from Rubio, which was well-received by the audience. This exchange, along with several other strong answers, marked a clear turning point in the debate for Rubio.\n\nTed Cruz also delivered a strong performance, emphasizing the need for entitlement reform, job creation, and his new tax plan. He was particularly critical of the debate's unseriousness and produced an incredulous soundbite that has since become an instant classic.\n\nOther candidates, such as Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, and Donald Trump, also had their moments during the debate. However, each man issued flat denials on challenges brought by moderators that turned out to be untrue, which may have negatively impacted their credibility.\n\nThe debate was widely criticized for CNBC's moderation, with many viewing it as a self-humiliation for the network. The debate marked a significant turning point for Jeb Bush's campaign, with some suggesting that his campaign may have suffered a mortal blow. The future of his campaign remains uncertain, but it is clear that his performance during the debate was underwhelming.",
    " Title: Bloomberg's Unprecedented Campaign Strategy in California and Super Tuesday States\n\nArticle:\n\nBillionaire Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign has significantly expanded its operations in California, hiring 200 employees, according to his campaign, surpassing the 80-strong team of rival Bernie Sanders. This move comes after Bloomberg entered the race in November, following a wave of resources that has allowed him to spend more on television ads nationally than all other Democratic candidates combined.\n\nBloomberg's unprecedented spending, totaling over a quarter-billion dollars on advertising alone since November, could disrupt the competition in California and the other 13 states voting on Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday, on March 3, will award nearly a third of the 3,979 state delegates that will help select a Democratic nominee. In contrast, the four early states - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina - award less than 4% of the delegates combined.\n\nWhile most Democratic candidates have focused on Iowa and New Hampshire since November, Bloomberg has primarily targeted states that don't typically receive attention at this stage in the race. This year's Super Tuesday could prove particularly crucial, especially if the first four states fail to produce a clear front-runner.\n\nIn California, Bloomberg has a staff of 150, while Senator Elizabeth Warren, who appears to have the next biggest presence, has more than two dozen paid staffers. Bloomberg's spending spree has also increased the cost of television ads in Texas, potentially making it more challenging for other candidates to keep up, according to an aide for a rival campaign.\n\nBoth Sanders and Biden are currently leading in national polls, with Biden appealing to moderates and Sanders to liberals. If Biden emerges as the front-runner in Iowa and New Hampshire, he could consolidate the support of moderates and potentially push Bloomberg aside before he even reaches a ballot, several Democratic strategists said. On the other hand, a Sanders surge could open a door for Bloomberg, given uncertainty among moderate voters about Sanders' ability to beat Republican President Donald Trump in November.\n\nBloomberg's campaign has 800 staffers in place across 35 states, with hundreds more at his campaign headquarters in New York. In Texas, his campaign's staffing is the second-largest after California. Other candidates' Super Tuesday operations will soon receive an influx of staffers, as organizers depart states like Iowa to bolster efforts elsewhere.\n\nIn a recent memo to supporters, Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, stated that the campaign has more than 1,000 staff members and more than 100 field offices in 31 states. This includes hundreds of organizers in states that vote after Super Tuesday, such as Pennsylvania and Washington. Sanders is also relying on enthusiastic volunteers, with volunteers holding over 560 events for Sanders in Texas, while the candidate himself has visited four times this primary season.\n\nIn an interview with [redacted] last month, Bloomberg stated that he was forced to skip the first four voting states because \"all the political operatives were taken up\" by the time he decided to enter the race. However, he vowed to go everywhere else, saying, \"You want to go where the voters are... And I'd like to go to every one of the states.\"",
    " Title: Bloomberg News to Maintain Independence During 2020 Presidential Campaign Amid Former Mayor's Candidacy\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has entered the 2020 presidential race, and the media angle of his announcement has raised questions about the impartiality of Bloomberg News, given that the media organization is owned by the candidate. In a note to staff obtained by CNN, Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait acknowledged the challenges this presents.\n\nMicklethwait wrote, \"There is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy for a newsroom that has built up its reputation for independence in part by not writing about ourselves (and very rarely about our direct competitors).\" He further stated, \"No previous presidential candidate has owned a journalistic organization of this size.\"\n\nTo address these concerns, Micklethwait outlined several measures. The editorials, which have reflected Bloomberg's views, will be suspended, and the editors responsible will take a leave of absence to join his campaign. The columnists, who produce the majority of Bloomberg Opinion's content, will continue to speak for themselves. The news organization will also continue to accept op-ed articles from external sources, although not on the election.\n\nRegarding campaign coverage, Micklethwait stated, \"We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation) and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.\" He added that if other news outlets run investigative pieces on Bloomberg or others, they won't \"hide\" them from readers.\n\nCurrently, Bloomberg News reporters are continuing to investigate the Trump administration, as the government of the day. If Bloomberg is chosen as the Democratic presidential candidate and Donald Trump emerges as the Republican one, they will reassess how they do that.\n\nIn conclusion, Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait has outlined measures to maintain the news organization's independence during the 2020 presidential campaign, despite the candidacy of its owner, Michael Bloomberg.",
    " Title: White House Silences Gun Control Groups to Ensure Presidential Unity in Push for New Gun Control Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's gun control agenda appears to be facing increasing challenges, yet key gun control advocates have remained silent on the matter. The White House, in an effort to maintain a unified front during the push for new gun control laws, has reportedly muted gun control groups by offering them access and involvement in exchange for silence and support.\n\nAccording to conversations with several involved parties, the White House has implied that gun control groups should avoid infighting, refrain from second-guessing in the press, and support the president and Vice President Joe Biden's proposals. The most crucial requirement is to avoid making waves or getting ahead of the White House.\n\nIn return, these groups are granted a voice in the discussions, a role in any final agreement, and weekly meetings at the White House with Bruce Reed, Biden's chief of staff, under the condition that they do not discuss what transpires during these meetings.\n\nOne regular attendee described the meetings as a unified front, stating, \"It's not like they're being bullies, it's them bringing everybody together, not being one-off meetings with groups that might be interested in things other than the bottom line, not providing the forum for that kind of stuff.\"\n\nAnother participant in the Reed meetings commented, \"You're glad to be in the room because this issue has been dead for a long time, and now there's a real opportunity there.\"\n\nFor the White House, which declined to comment on Reed's meetings or the relationships with the gun control groups, this strategy is aimed at ensuring the president has a unified front as he pushes for new laws and avoiding shouldering the blame if and when the negotiations fail.\n\nThe White House's strategy has resulted in a significant change for some of Washington's most vocal gun control advocates, including the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Third Way, Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns, and Americans for Responsible Solutions, the organization founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, Mark Kelly. In past fights, gun control groups have sparred with each other and dictated the agenda to allies in Congress.\n\nNow, these groups are content with merely being included in the discussion and still holding out hope that something might happen. Paul Helmke, who was the Brady Campaign president from 2006 to 2011, stated, \"We need the White House.\"\n\nThis reliance on the White House has persisted even as the prospects for any legislation have diminished on even the most basic measures. On Wednesday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ended bipartisan talks on universal background checks with Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and filed his own bill without co-sponsors or the suggestions made by Coburn and Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).",

Ron Johnson's accusation that the Obama administration initially misrepresented the responsible parties.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Johnson stated that he perceived Clinton's response as \"theatrics,\" while Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, known for his liberal views, described her remarks as \"a potent brew of righteous outrage.\" On CBS This Morning, Post columnist David Ignatius suggested that Johnson's questioning might be the first in a series of Republican attacks on Clinton, who is speculated to be a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nDuring the hearing, when Johnson pressed Clinton on the administration's knowledge of the attack and when they became aware, Clinton displayed visible anger as she stated:\n\n\"The fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again.\"\n\nC-SPAN's video library provides two clips of Clinton's exchange with Johnson. The first, lasting 2 minutes and 25 seconds, offers a broad sense of the conversation leading to her animated comments. A shorter version focuses on the sharpest part of the exchange.\n\nClinton is soon to step down from her position. President Obama has nominated Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) to replace her. Today, at 10 a.m. ET, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the same committee that held Wednesday's hearing, is holding its confirmation hearing for Kerry.\n\nKerry, the committee's chairman, will not preside over his own nomination hearing. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) will be in the chairman's seat. It is expected that Kerry will face little opposition in the Senate.

    " Title: White House Press Secretary Urges Media to Review Controversial Video, Playboy Correspondent Rebuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed the White House press corps to watch a video from conservative provocateur James O' Keefe, sparking a rebuttal from a Playboy correspondent.\n\nThe sequence of events began when deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked a question by Charlie Spiering of Breitbart, a right-wing website, regarding the recent controversy at CNN. Spiering inquired about the Senate's alleged investigation into a meeting between a top Trump campaign staffer and an official from a Russian investment fund, a story that CNN published and later retracted. The error led to three CNN employees, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Eric Lichtblau, stepping down on Monday.\n\n\"The president went on Twitter this morning and repeated that CNN was fake news,\" Spiering said. \"Why wasn't [CNN's] response good enough for the president?\"\n\nSanders used this opportunity to express her criticisms of the mainstream media. She also suggested that reporters watch a video from James O' Keefe, which shows a CNN producer criticizing CNN's treatment of the Trump-Russia story. The producer, John Bonifield, works on CNN's health team and does not appear to be connected to CNN's political coverage. It also seems that Bonifield was taped without his knowledge, a major ethics violation.\n\n\"There's a video circulating now\u2014whether it's accurate or not, I don't know\u2014but I would encourage everybody in this room, and frankly everybody across this country, to take a look at it,\" Sanders said. \"I think if it is accurate, it is a disgrace to all of media, all of journalism.\"\n\nSanders expressed concern about the state of media and journalism, stating, \"I think we have gone to a place where if the media can't be trusted to report the news, then that's a dangerous place for America.\" She further added, \"And I think if that's the place where certain outlets are going, particularly for the purpose of spiking ratings, and if that's coming directly from the top, then I think that's even more scary, and certainly more disgraceful.\"\n\nSanders also criticized the media's use of unnamed sources. However, her remarks were interrupted by Brian J. Karem, a correspondent for Playboy, who delivered a sharply worded rebuttal:\n\n\"Come on, you're inflaming everybody right here, right now, with those words. This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heaven\u2014any one of us are replaceable, and any one of us, if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us. You have been elected to serve for four years at least. There is no option other than that. We're here to ask you questions. You're here to provide the answers. And what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, 'See, once again, the president is right, and everybody else out here is fake media.'\"\n\nSanders responded coolly, stating, \"I think if anything has been inflamed, it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media.\"",
    " Title: Historical Analysis of Democratic Presidential Candidates' Post-Election Behavior\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses a perceived characteristic of modern-Democratic presidential candidates, as noted by some historians, which is their behavior following election losses. The article suggests that, with the exception of former President Barack Obama, these candidates have been described as \"sore losers.\"\n\nThe article mentions former President Barack Obama, who won the presidency twice, but is characterized as a \"sore winner\" due to his alleged grumping and grousing since leaving the White House. The article also compares Obama's economic record with that of current President Donald Trump, stating that Trump's economy is on its way to new records every quarter.\n\nThe article then discusses the 1976 election, in which Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan. Carter reportedly became the first American president to speak ill of a sitting president while visiting foreign soil, which is cited as an example of a sore loser.\n\nIn 2000, Al Gore, the inventor of the Internet, lost to George W. Bush in a controversial election decided by the Electoral College. The article suggests that Gore may still be irritable about the election, which was decided by 537 votes after the votes of almost 6 million Floridians were counted.\n\nIn 2004, John Kerry, a senator at the time, ran against George W. Bush and is described as delusional due to his exploitation of his Vietnam service and eventual \"betrayal of trust\" with his comrades while he had returned home to harangue the war and to visit with the North Vietnamese in Paris. The article mentions the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, who turned on Kerry and helped to beat him in the election.\n\nThe article also mentions Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 election and her continued criticism of President Trump, the Russians, and those in agreement with the President. The article states that Clinton's call to \"resistance\" should remind readers of her behavior in 1968.\n\nThe article concludes by referencing Richard Nixon's 1960 loss to John F. Kennedy by 112,000 votes, stating that Nixon did not contest the results and claiming that American historians dislike Nixon.",

As a precautionary measure, we are undertaking a drawdown of all but essential personnel in Lahore.\" The consulate was already closed yesterday through Sunday for Eid al-Fitr, a festive holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. However, the consulate will not reopen on Monday, and there is no date set for it to reopen, reports The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe move is unrelated to the closure of 19 US diplomatic posts throughout the Middle East and Africa in the last week. The US has also issued a travel alert for the country, stating that various groups in Pakistan pose a threat to American citizens there.\n\nUS diplomatic posts in Pakistan have been targeted before, most recently the consulate in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. A car bomb and grenade attack killed four Pakistanis there in 2010.\n\nThe Pakistani government is also on high alert after receiving intelligence that militants had plans to attack key locations in the city, such as the airport and parliament building, according to The Times.\n\nAccording to Pakistani newspaper Dawn, a major suicide bombing in an Islamabad mosque was thwarted today when the bomber was gunned down before he could enter the mosque and detonate his vest of explosives.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that there has been a \"wave of extremist violence\" in Pakistan. Many of the local groups are linked to Al Qaeda and oppose the Pakistani government's alliance with the US, but the \"vast majority\" of their victims are fellow Pakistanis, not Americans.\n\nOn Friday, gunmen opened fire on worshipers leaving a mosque in the western city of Quetta, killing 10 people who had come to offer prayers for the Eid al-Fitr festival marking the end of the Ramadan month of fasting. Police said the intended target appeared to be a politician present at the site, who escaped unhurt. Pakistani militants unleashed a vicious wave of killings during Ramadan, as the new government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif struggled to get a grip on the security situation. Mr. Sharif, who took office in early June, vowed Thursday to show the militants an \"iron fist,\" as his government announced that its counterterrorism policy would be ready next week.\n\nOn Thursday in Quetta, a suicide bomber attacked the funeral of a police officer killed by militants. The bombing killed at least 30 people, including 21 police personnel. Some of the city's most senior police officers perished in the attack.\n\nThe Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Thursday's attack in Quetta, saying it was revenge for a police raid on an allied group.\n\nThe violence has \"rattled\" Mr. Sharif's government, reports The New York Times. The prime minister ordered his interior minister to visit Quetta and pushed him to present the national counterterrorism strategy soon.\n\nCritics say the lack of such a strategy has resulted in confusion and a lack of consensus about how to deal with the terrorists. Opposition politicians urged the government to immediately convene a national conference of all political parties to come to a policy consensus. \"The delay is causing more acts of terrorism,\" said Syed Khurshid Shah, an opposition lawmaker belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party.\n\n\"The government cannot leave the country to be a playing-field of terrorists. We will be handling them with an iron fist,\" Mr. Sharif said, according to the Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune.\n\nThe latest wave of violence has caused some Pakistanis to despair, particularly amid the backdrop of the holy month of Ramadan, as articulated in an editorial in the Pakistani newspaper the Nation titled \"A difficult Eid.\"",

In a six-page letter to acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the chairmen of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, respectively, expressed concerns about the FBI's decision not to prosecute Clinton for her improper use of a government email.\n\nAfter a year-long joint congressional inquiry, the committees reviewed thousands of documents and interviewed key witnesses, concluding that former FBI Director James Comey acted improperly when he cleared Clinton of wrongdoing. They claim that some witnesses, including FBI General Counsel James Baker, did not support the exoneration.\n\nThe chairmen had initially asked former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel in March, but he declined and instead appointed U.S. Attorney John Huber to the task. The lawmakers state that Huber is still conducting the review. If Whitaker does not appoint a special counsel, the lawmakers suggest that Congress should continue the investigation.\n\nThe chairmen also raised concerns about the FBI's handling of the probe into Trump's campaign and possible collusion with Russians, specifically citing the alleged bias of federal agents and their different treatment of the candidates during the election. They question how derogatory information about Trump was accessed by the FBI, the sourcing of such information, its vetting, and the government's reliance on it in court pleadings.\n\nThe Republicans had questioned Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for two days on Capitol Hill earlier this month. Lynch did not comment on her closed-door questioning, but Comey stated that the closed-door hearing harms the integrity of the FBI. He also used the hearing as an opportunity to criticize the president.\n\nRepublicans had also wanted to speak with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has been overseeing the probe into Russian interference and had reportedly joked about wearing a wire to secretly record the president.",

The company, currently valued at $850 million, plans to utilize the funds to produce more content, expand its video production unit, and open additional offices worldwide.\n\nChris Dixon, a partner at Andreeson Horowitz, described Buzzfeed as a \"preeminent media company.\" The website, initially launched in 2006 as an aggregator of light-hearted lists, videos, and quizzes, gained popularity among young people and office workers for its engaging and colloquial content.\n\nRecently, Buzzfeed has shifted its focus towards current affairs, hiring a team of journalists and blending its irreverent style with hard news. The Buzzfeed audience is growing, with 75% of hits coming via social media referrals from platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest. The site attracts approximately four times more viewers per month than The New York Times and was valued more than three times higher than The Washington Post, which was purchased by Jeff Bezos for $250 million this year.\n\nIn a blog post, Chris Dixon explained that Andreeson Horowitz invested in Buzzfeed because it is \"disruptive,\" having significantly altered the online media landscape. One of the reasons for this disruption is Buzzfeed's understanding of the internet, with all content being available and formatted for mobile devices, targeting users who browse while waiting in lines or commuting to work.\n\nOne of the primary uses for the new funding will be to allocate more resources towards Buzzfeed Motion Pictures, its video unit based in Los Angeles. The company plans to focus on producing videos ranging from six seconds to one-hour documentaries. Buzzfeed's videos are already popular, often being picked up by mainstream media sites, such as the one examining \"What Men Are Really Saying When Catcalling Women.\" The future may even see the release of a movie based on \"23 Ways To Have The Coolest Locker In School.\"",
    " Title: Study Reveals Rising Political Polarization on Climate Change in the U.S., with WSJ Climate Coverage Accused of Denial and Misinformation\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by a team of sociologists at Oklahoma State University has found that political polarization on climate change is growing in the United States. Today's Republicans are less likely than they were a decade ago to accept that the effects of global warming have begun, that humans are responsible, and that there is a scientific consensus on these questions. Democrats and independents are slightly more likely to answer these questions correctly today than a decade ago.\n\nThe study, titled \"Politics and Global Warming: The American Public's Changing Attitudes and the Role of the Media,\" found that climate change is now more polarizing in the U.S. than abortion or gay marriage. At the same time, climate denial has become the norm among Republican policymakers, as they've grown increasingly anti-environment.\n\nThe study notes that what was once a modest tendency for Congressional Republicans to be less pro-environmental than their Democratic counterparts has become a chasm, with Republicans taking near-unanimous anti-environmental stances on relevant legislation in recent years, especially in 2015.\n\nPolicymakers work for their constituents, so if Republican voters are generally apathetic about the tremendous threats posed by climate change, party leaders have relatively little motivation to tackle the problem (aside from the obvious, like protecting future generations and the long-term viability of their political party).\n\nHowever, the public responds to cues from intellectual and cultural leaders. Were Republican leaders to start listening to climate science experts, many of their voters would likely follow suit. After all, most American conservatives already support climate policies; they just don't view the issue as a priority. Unfortunately, today's Republican Party is essentially controlled by the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe study argues that the conservative movement, fearful of the regulatory implications of climate change, and seeking to defend the current economic system built on fossil fuel use, has been the driving force behind organized climate change denial.\n\nPublic perception and priorities are also heavily influenced by the media. A 2013 study found that conservative media consumers are more likely to distrust scientific experts and reject climate science realities.\n\nRelatedly, a new report by Media Matters on climate coverage in major American newspaper opinion pages found pervasive misinformation in the Wall Street Journal. Out of 93 climate-related opinion pieces published in the Journal during the time period examined, 31 featured climate science denial or other scientifically inaccurate claims about climate change (33 percent).\n\nA study last year found that the WSJ's biased climate coverage extended beyond its opinion pages to its news coverage as well. And during the time of the scandalous #ExxonKnew revelations, Media Matters found that the WSJ was a constant apologist for the oil company.\n\nThe WSJ readership is heavily comprised of wealthy, powerful men, and it has become an increasingly conservative paper since Rupert Murdoch purchased it. Conservative media consumers are bombarded with climate misinformation and fossil fuel industry propaganda, usually without the authors' fossil fuel ties being disclosed.\n\nThe industry has created an echo chamber in which they control the climate messaging of conservative media and party leaders, which in turn trickles down to misinform Republican voters, growing the partisan gap on climate change. The authors of the Oklahoma State study see no easy way to break through what they call the \"denial countermovement\":\n\nconsisting of fossil fuel corporations and business allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, conservative think tanks and their funders, conservative media, and a large supporting cast of front groups, bloggers, and contrarian scientists.\n\nDoes any persuasive framing strategy hold special promise for penetrating Republicans' partisan/ideological identities? The evidence so far gives little basis for optimism.\n\nThere's plenty of blame to go around. Republican policymakers have failed to deliver much-needed leadership on climate change, American conservatives have relied too heavily on biased media sources, and conservative media outlets like Murdoch's WSJ have misinformed their readers.\n\nUntil the fossil fuel industry's control over conservative policymakers and media loosens, American climate action will be up to the Democratic Party. This weekend, President Obama and Chinese President Xi announced they will formally ratify the Paris climate change agreement. If she is elected president, Hillary Clinton likewise plans to rely on executive actions to tackle climate change.\n\nBut there's a limit to what the President of the United States can do on his or her own. U.S. Congress still controls American climate policy, or the lack thereof. As long as the conservative media continues to misinform readers and breed a conservative culture of climate denial, American efforts to tackle the threat of climate change will be constrained, and the future of human society and of the Republican Party will be endangered.",
    " Title: A Call for a National Discourse Do-Over: Banning the \"Butt Defense\" in Political Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spirit of the New Year, the familiar promise of fresh beginnings has arrived, but the hope for a national kumbaya moment seems distant. Instead, the nation has largely abandoned the water cooler discussions for heated exchanges on social media platforms. In an attempt to promote a more civil discourse, one social media user shared a meme featuring a snarling dog and a quote from Proverbs 26:17, \"Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears is he who rushes into a quarrel not his own.\"\n\nThe user's hope for this message to go viral, however, may be unrealistic, as the nation seems eager to stake a position in the day's trending battles. To address this issue, the author proposes a discourse do-over, drawing inspiration from a rule implemented in their household for sibling conflicts.\n\nThe rule, known as the \"Butt Defense,\" is a fallback in political discussions that keeps the nation mired in the mess. The author, in their role as a parent, did not teach their children to use the Butt Defense, but rather observed that they employed it naturally in their desire to defend themselves and promote their own interests.\n\nThe \"Butt Defense\" is a defense mechanism where individuals justify their actions by pointing to the actions of others. For example, \"Yes, I did hit him, but he hit me first.\" In the author's household, the \"Butt Defense\" was swiftly overruled, and the child using it was reminded of the correct response to the situation and what they could do differently in the future. Banning the \"Butt Defense\" helped the family move forward.\n\nThe author suggests that if we could ban the \"Butt Defense\" in our national conversation, it would help ostracize the extreme elements on all sides and diminish their impact. The call to action for those concerned about the lack of civility in politics is to refuse to defend what should be indefensible and to call hateful or atrocious actions what they are without giving any \"cover\" in their own circle by employing the \"Butt Defense.\"\n\nThe author acknowledges that the original citation of Proverbs in their post contained an editing error, with the correct verse being Proverbs 26:17, not 16:7.",
    " Title: Google Bans 200 Publishers from AdSense Network in Response to Fake News Proliferation\n\nArticle:\n\nGoogle has removed 200 publishers from its AdSense network, an ad placement service, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The ban was enacted due to the proliferation of fake news sites, which mislead users with their content. The publishers were prohibited from the service under an update to an existing policy that bars sites with misleading content.\n\nNot all 200 publishers were targeted as part of the effort to root out fake news sites. The ban occurred in November and December, and included sites that impersonate real news organizations through shortened top-level domains, such as those ending in \".co\" instead of the more common \".com.\" Google declined to provide a listing of the banned sites.\n\nGoogle's 2016 \"bad ads\" report, typically released at the beginning of each year, revealed that so-called fake news publishers sometimes take advantage of \".co\" domains to appear similar to legitimate news sites.\n\nIn addition to the ban on fake news sites, Google's 2016 annual report on violations of advertising policy also included data on ads removed. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations, compared to 780 million in 2015. Google attributes the increase in ad removals to a combination of advertiser behavior and improvements in technology to detect offending ads.\n\nGoogle added a policy mid-year to prohibit ads for payday loans, considered predatory. Roughly five million payday loan ads were disabled over the latter six months of 2016. Also among the removed ads were what Google calls \"tabloid cloakers.\" These advertisers run what look like links to news headlines, but when the user clicks, an ad for a product such as a weight loss supplement pops up. Google suspended 1,300 accounts engaged in tabloid cloaking in 2016.\n\nIt is unavailable whether the ban on publishers from the AdSense network and the removal of ads for payday loans and tabloid cloaking were the only actions taken by Google in response to the proliferation of fake news and misleading ads.",
    " Title: Federal Government Shutdown Affects National Parks and Museums, but Essential Services Remain Operational\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing federal government shutdown, which began on December 21, has led to the closure of several national parks and museums due to a lack of funding. While some federal services and employees deemed \"essential\" are still functioning, national parks and federal institutions are classified as \"non-essential\" and have been affected by the shutdown.\n\nThe National Park Service, under a contingency plan adopted earlier this year, kept many national parks open for a time without park rangers, maintenance workers, and other staff who have been furloughed due to the shutdown. However, without these workers, trash has accumulated, and restrooms have become dirtier, leading to the closure of Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Joshua Tree National Parks in California, as well as parts of Yosemite.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the Smithsonian and the National Gallery of Art remained open using leftover funds that had been previously allocated. However, these funds have since run out, and the Smithsonian announced today that its museums and the National Zoo would be closing. The National Gallery notes at the top of its website that its status after today \"is yet to be determined.\"\n\nWhile some people are concerned about these closures, it is essential to understand that these institutions are classified as \"non-essential,\" and their current closures primarily affect leisure activities. The closures are unfortunate for tourists who planned trips around these parks and museums, but there are plenty of privately run institutions that are not affected by the government shutdown, such as the Phillips Collection, the National Building Museum, and the Newseum in Washington D.C.\n\nIn California, there is a sprawling state park system that can be visited instead. The supposed \"trashing\" of the parks is not cause for significant concern, as the issues primarily involve litter, dirty bathrooms, and people relieving themselves in the wrong places. These problems are not hard to remedy once furloughed employees are back on the job. In the meantime, shutting the parks and not letting the trash pile up any further is the right thing to do.",
    " Title: Recall Efforts Target Colorado Democratic Lawmakers Over Tough Gun-Control Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nColorado Democratic lawmakers who recently helped pass some of the nation's toughest gun-control laws are facing political backlash in the form of recall efforts. Two groups, Pueblo Freedom and Rights Group, are targeting state Rep. Mike McLachlan and state Sens. Angela Giron, Evie Hudak, and John Morse.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled legislature passed bills that ban magazines holding more than 15 rounds and require background checks for all gun transfers. These bills were signed into law in March by Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nSenate President John Morse pushed a more far-reaching proposal that called for holding owners, sellers, and makers of assault-type weapons liable for havoc inflicted by their guns. He withdrew the bill upon realizing he didn't have enough votes. However, his efforts have still drawn the ire of the groups.\n\nThe petition drives require signatures from 25 percent of the vote in each lawmaker's district to trigger a special election. The signature deadline is May 21. Colorado's Secretary of State office has confirmed with FoxNews.com that it has approved the forms for the petition drives.\n\nThe legislature also passed a bill before adjourning Friday that prohibits domestic-violence offenders from owning guns. Hickenlooper is also expected to sign that legislation.\n\nSen. John Morse is getting help from a group called \"A Whole Lot of People for John Morse,\" which is collecting money and petition signatures to fight the recall effort. The group has so far raised $23,050, according to The Daily Caller.\n\nSen. Evie Hudak angered gun-rights advocates and others due to a comment made to a rape victim testifying against a bill that would have banned concealed weapons on college campuses. She suggested the attacker might have used the gun on the woman had she been carrying a concealed weapon, saying \"statistics are not on your side even if you had a gun.\"\n\nConnecticut, Maryland, and New York also have passed tighter gun-control measures following the Dec. 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut school in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed. However, there are no indications of organized recall efforts in those Democratic-leaning states.",
    " Title: North Korea's Threats Against South Korea: Stephan Haggard Suggests Domestic Politics Play a Role\n\nArticle:\n\nStephan Haggard, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, has suggested that North Korea's recent threats against South Korea may be more bluff than genuine intent. Haggard's analysis is based on the escalating signals of resolve from North Korea, which he interprets as a sign of nervousness rather than strength.\n\nAccording to Haggard, the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, may not have fully consolidated his authority, and some of the rhetoric could be driven by domestic politics. March brought a series of what pundits call \"provocations\" by North Korea, but upon closer inspection, Pyongyang has opted for rhetoric over actual military actions.\n\nThe first round of saber-rattling occurred as the U.N. Security Council deliberated on a new sanctions resolution after North Korea's satellite launch in December and its third nuclear test in February. North Korea ultimately \"withdrew\" from the armistice, but it had done so before, and it is unclear what its recent statements actually mean. The armistice is not a peace treaty but merely a ceasefire.\n\nThe armistice is stable not because of verbal commitments but because of the deterrent capability of both sides. Is anything really different as a result of this \"re-withdrawal\"? It does not seem like it. Equally unfortunate was North Korea's decision to renege on a number of North-South agreements, such as a North-South agreement on the denuclearization of the peninsula. However, Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons had made these and a number of other agreements moot in any case.\n\nNorth Korea's bluster had little if any effect on the U.N. debate. If anything, its threats may have been counterproductive. Although the resolution was portrayed as the result of a U.S.-South Korean cabal, China also signed on, and the resolution was passed unanimously.\n\nThe measure opens the door for tighter financial sanctions, and there is some preliminary evidence that Beijing may be cooperating in tightening economic exchanges with the country. The next round of statements came as North Korea and the United States and South Korea entered an annual military training cycle. These periods are always fraught with tension, as Pyongyang denounces the routine exercises as provocative.\n\nAs the country effectively mobilizes, the North Korean press is filled with pictures of Kim Jong Un directing the troops in exercises, some of which were reportedly manipulated with Photoshop to increase their effect. As a result of these exercises, there is some background of what might be called \"ritualized escalation\" at work.\n\nHowever, North Korea did possibly make one major misstep in arguing that it might undertake a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Announcing an intention to pre-empt is dangerous because even small tactical movements can be misinterpreted. Such statements have to be taken seriously, and, if anything, the United States and South Korea may have over-reacted by such a public display of force.\n\nIn particular, the U.S. announced a major new ballistic missile defense initiative, training runs by B52 and B2 bombers, and an updated U.S.-ROK Combined Counter-Provocation Plan. In the last few days, the U.S. was again quite public about its deployment of jet fighters to the peninsula as well.\n\nThere is a larger game at work here that probably centers on the difficult-to-read domestic politics of North Korea. It is by no means assured that Kim Jong Un has fully consolidated his authority. By ramping up rhetoric, but exercising restraint with respect to actual military actions, the regime can count on the fact that the United States and South Korea are not going to take the first step either.\n\nThe result is that North Korea's exercises and threats of retaliation have been successful in deterring attack, even though none was coming. The regime can claim some sort of victory in staring down American threats in its two big political meetings this week, the timing of which suggests that some of the rhetoric has been driven by domestic politics.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear and missile programs constitute problems that the five parties in the region\u2014China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the United States\u2014need to address through concerted action. However, overheated rhetoric, however disconcerting, is not the same as an intention to attack. Coolly maintaining our deterrent and not over-reacting to hyperbole is the proper course of action. With luck, the leadership will pivot away from nuclear posturing toward economic reform, the main thing that the people of North Korea really need.",
    " Title: Gunmen Identified in Bardo Museum Attack; Islamic State Claims Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Bardo Museum attack in Tunisia's capital, the two gunmen responsible for the deadly shooting rampage have been identified as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui, both Tunisian nationals. The Islamic State (IS) has claimed responsibility for the attack, which left 21 people dead, primarily foreign tourists.\n\nThe attack occurred on Wednesday at the National Bardo Museum, a popular tourist destination in Tunis, the birthplace of the Arab Spring democracy movement. The two gunmen were killed by police during the attack, and five officers were also wounded.\n\nThursday saw the arrest of nine individuals, with five of them being directly linked to the two gunmen, and the other four accused of having ties to the terrorist cell involved. Culture Minister Latifa Lakhdar spoke defiantly at the museum, stating, \"They are targeting knowledge. They are targeting science. They are targeting reason. They are targeting history. They are targeting memory, because all these things mean nothing in their eyes.\"\n\nThe IS released an online recording claiming responsibility for the attack, praising the \"knights of the Islamic State\" and referring to the museum as a \"den of infidels and vice.\" The slain gunmen, Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui, were identified by Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid, with Laabidi having been flagged by intelligence authorities, although not for \"anything special.\"\n\nMore than 3,000 Tunisians are estimated to have joined IS militants in Iraq and Syria, according to the Tunisian government. Training camps in neighboring Libya provide easy access to the fight for Tunisian Muslims discontent with the fledgling democracy in Tunis.\n\nAmong the victims were passengers from two cruise ships, the MSC Splendida and the Costa Fascinosa. More than half of the dead were tourists, with 17 of them being foreign nationals. The Islamic State's claim of responsibility for the attack has led to cancellations of future arrivals by five major ship companies.\n\nJapanese tourist Noriko Yuki, 35, was among the victims, having sustained injuries to her back and hands. Her 68-year-old mother also suffered injuries and underwent surgery at a Tunisian hospital. U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama expressed condolences over the attack, stating, \"We want to express our condolences over the horrific event yesterday in Tunisia.\"\n\nTunisia has faced militant activity since the revolution that ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, with assassinations of liberal, secular politicians and attacks on tourist destinations being common occurrences.",
    " Title: President Obama Apologizes for Health Insurance Cancellations under Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has expressed his apologies to Americans who have lost their health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), despite his previous assurances that they could keep their insurance plans. In an exclusive interview with NBC News at the White House, Obama stated, \"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\"\n\nThe apology follows the president's addition of a grandfathering caveat to his healthcare pitch during a speech to Obama for America supporters in Washington D.C. last week. He clarified that individuals who had health insurance plans before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted and liked those plans could keep them, provided the plans had not changed since the law's passage.\n\nThe administration has been denying for nearly two weeks that President Obama lied or misled millions of people about keeping their health insurance plans. However, NBC News and other major news outlets reported last week that the White House knew for years that cancellation letters would be issued and told Americans they could keep their plans anyway.\n\nAccording to NBC News, citing four sources deeply involved in ACA, about 50% to 75% of the 14 million consumers who buy health insurance individually will receive a \"cancellation\" letter or its equivalent in the next year because their current policies do not meet the standards laid out by the new law.\n\nDemocratic Senators on Capitol Hill are currently working to pass legislation that would allow millions of Americans who have received cancellation notices to get their healthcare plans back. It is unclear if President Obama is willing to support this effort.\n\nSixty-seven percent of Americans in the individual health insurance market are expected to lose their current health plans as insurance companies comply with Obamacare requirements under the law.",
    " Title: Billionaire Warren Buffett's Philanthropy Focuses on Abortion Funding, Remains Unreported\n\nArticle:\n\nMay 13, 2014, marks one year since Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder for the deaths of three babies delivered alive and then killed at his clinic. Gosnell's case has become a symbol in the pro-life community. However, another figure, liberal billionaire Warren Buffett, has been a significant donor to abortion organizations, contributing over $1.2 billion from 2001 to 2012.\n\nThis amount is equivalent to the cost of approximately 2.7 million first-trimester abortions, more than twice the number of abortions that occur in the United States in a year. Unlike Gosnell, Buffett's actions have been entirely legal. However, both Gosnell and Buffett share a commonality: their stories have been largely unreported.\n\nThe Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Buffett's first wife, who was an abortion supporter, is led by pro-abortion activist Tracy Weitz, Ph.D., MPA. Weitz has worked at Planned Parenthood and The Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health and once defined abortion as \"a moral action undertaken by moral agents.\"\n\nThe foundation's website primarily focuses on college scholarships and the \"Alice Buffett Outstanding Teacher Award,\" which recognizes outstanding Omaha Public School teachers (K-12). The award and scholarships do not hint at the darker direction of the massive charity.\n\nThe website's content seems deliberately insular, with copyrights on the pages dating back to 2008, and the charity making it clear that they only respond to inquiries about college scholarships and the Alice Buffett Outstanding Teacher Award.\n\nSince 2001, there has only been one tangential mention of Buffett's support for abortion on the broadcast TV network morning and evening news shows. This mention was in the NBC \"Nightly News\" obituary for his wife, which included her support for Planned Parenthood.\n\nBuffett was never mentioned as a top donor when Live Action embarrassed Planned Parenthood with two videos of staffers assisting a Live Action actor with a possible sex selection abortion. Additionally, in early 2011, Live Action's Lila Rose trained investigators to pose as a pimp and a prostitute running a sex ring composed of 14- and 15-year-olds. Planned Parenthood workers were willing to help provide underage abortions.\n\nInstead, the media portrays Buffett as a grandfatherly, tax-hiking, and investor figure. As a reliable liberal businessman, journalists often turn to him as a source for almost any commentary. It is easy to understand why, as giving $1,000 to a ballot initiative to defend traditional marriage is controversial, while giving $1.25 billion to promote abortion goes unnoticed by journalists who are pro-abortion.\n\nHowever, with the information now out in the open, watch as the supposedly \"neutral\" news media does its best to hide it.",
    " Title: Syria Crisis Not Primary Factor in Delay of Immigration Reform, Says Ruben Navarrette\n\nArticle:\n\nRuben Navarrette, a political commentator, has stated that the Syrian crisis did not play a significant role in the delay of immigration reform in the U.S. Congress. He argues that the comprehensive immigration reform is not just on hold for the remainder of this year but will be off the agenda until 2015 and beyond.\n\nNavarrette asserts that the GOP-controlled House of Representatives might vote on a \"reform-lite\" bill, offering legal status but not citizenship, or provide legal status only to farm workers and DREAMers, undocumented young people who seek preferential treatment due to their intentions to attend college or join the military. However, large-scale reform offering legal status to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States has faded, and the Congress's limited working schedule, as members only show up for work in odd-numbered years, means the conversation will likely continue in 2015, 2017, and 2019.\n\nNavarrette disputes the claim that the Syrian crisis was the primary reason for the delay in immigration reform. Instead, he identifies three main reasons for the stalemate:\n\n1. The major legislative offering, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, collapsed under its own weight due to its length and excessive pork-barrel spending.\n2. The debate was primarily about politics rather than policy, with many amendments added to secure the support of individual senators.\n3. The debate was inherently dishonest, with neither side able to trust the other, leading to posturing and hot air from both parties.\n\nNavarrette suggests that the immigration reform process was focused on providing work permits, the ability to travel, and a driver's license, while ignoring citizenship and voting privileges, which is a repeated deal-breaker for politicians. Additionally, he argues that the Senate bill, due to the Corker-Hoeven \"border surge\" amendment, offered more agents and fencing, which is not what Border Patrol agents and supervisors requested.\n\nNavarrette concludes that the Syrian crisis provides a convenient excuse for lawmakers looking for an exit from the immigration reform debate, as it allows them to avoid addressing the complexities of the issue.",
    " Title: Warren Buffett Laments Difficulty in Finding Acquisitions, Awaits \"Huge\" Non-Insurance Deals for Berkshire Hathaway\n\nArticle:\n\nWarren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, expressed his difficulty in finding suitable companies to buy in his annual letter to shareholders on Saturday. The conglomerate is currently holding $116 billion in low-yielding cash and government bonds due to the challenge of finding \"sensible purchase prices.\"\n\nBuffett attributed the difficulty to a \"purchasing frenzy\" by deal-hungry chief executives employing cheap debt, which makes the task of finding acquisitions difficult for Berkshire, as the company typically pays all cash for acquisitions.\n\nThe letter, which was shorter than in recent years, did not discuss major Berkshire stock holdings such as Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Buffett often invests in stocks when he cannot find whole companies to buy.\n\nThe letter also did not fault excesses of Wall Street and Washington, and said nothing about Berkshire's plan to create a healthcare company with Amazon.com Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nBerkshire reported a record $44.94 billion annual profit, though $29.1 billion stemmed from the slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate, which reduced the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's deferred tax liabilities. Book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 23 percent in 2017.\n\nIt has been more than two years since Buffett made a major purchase, the $32.1 billion takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, and his advancing age gives him less time to find more of the \"elephants\" he prefers.\n\nHowever, he has given himself and longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, more freedom to focus on investing and allocating capital. Neither has signaled any intention of stepping down soon, though Berkshire last month named two additional vice chairmen who could eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.\n\nGregory Abel, who had run Berkshire Hathaway Energy, is now overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, all of which employ 330,000 people, while insurance specialist Ajit Jain oversees the Geico auto insurer and other insurance businesses, employing 47,000.\n\nWhile the Wells Fargo investment has struggled in recent months due to scandals over how it treats customers, Apple has performed better. Buffett revealed in his letter that Berkshire was sitting at year-end on a $7.25 billion paper profit on what has become a 3.3 percent stake in the iPhone maker, worth $28.2 billion.\n\nSome Berkshire stock investments are made by deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who Buffett said together manage about $25 billion, up from $21 billion a year ago.\n\nBuffett also warned long-term investors, including pension funds, college endowments, and \"savings-minded individuals,\" that even with U.S. stock prices near record highs, it would be a \"terrible mistake\" to assume bonds are safer.\n\n\"Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk,\" he wrote.\n\nFourth-quarter net income quintupled to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which Buffett considers a better gauge of performance, fell more than analysts expected in the fourth quarter, and slid 18 percent for the year to $14.46 billion.\n\nFull-year results suffered from Berkshire's first full-year insurance underwriting loss since 2002, hurt by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and wildfires in California. Even so, insurance float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, and which give Buffett more money to invest, rose 25 percent last year, to $114.5 billion.",
    " Title: Former Colorado Governor and 2020 Democratic Candidate Warns Against Embracing Socialism\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has expressed concerns about his party straying too far to the left as it selects a nominee to challenge President Trump in the upcoming election. In an interview with NPR, Hickenlooper voiced his opposition to some of the party's major policy proposals, such as the Green New Deal and \"Medicare for All.\"\n\n\"If we don't stand up and say that we Democrats do not stand for socialism, we're going to end up reelecting the worst president this country has ever had,\" Hickenlooper said.\n\nDuring the interview, which was part of NPR's Opening Arguments conversations exploring the presidential candidates' core messages, Hickenlooper criticized the Green New Deal's proposal to guarantee every American a federal job and the \"Medicare for All\" plan's potential forcible removal of private insurance for 150 million people. He argued that these policies are perceived by many Americans as aspects of socialism.\n\nHowever, Hickenlooper acknowledged the importance of addressing income inequality, ensuring women's reproductive rights, and addressing civil rights and social justice issues. He emphasized the need to focus on kitchen table issues, such as job creation and economic stability, to win in key swing states like Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nHickenlooper highlighted his experience in bringing people together, citing his record of near-universal health care and the No. 1 economy in the country during his tenure as governor.

    " Title: Attorney General Barr's Summary of Mueller Report: Length, Release, and Grand Jury Information\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr has released a four-page summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the conclusions of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. The New York Times reports that the Mueller report \"exceeds 300 pages\" in length, citing unidentified American officials with knowledge of the matter. However, the exact page count is unclear, with Fox's Andrew Napolitano claiming the report is 700 pages long, and the Times noting that previous lengthy reports, such as Ken Starr's Clinton-Lewinsky report, last year's inspector-general report on the Clinton emails investigation, and the 9/11 Commission report, were significantly longer.\n\nThe Attorney General has not revealed the exact number of pages in the Mueller report to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, who has only stated that the report is \"very substantial.\" When asked whether that means fewer than a thousand pages, Nadler replied, \"I would think so.\" The Attorney General has not committed to the April 2 deadline House Democrats would like to impose.\n\nThe debate over the report's length and the Attorney General's summary has sparked discussions about potential omissions in Barr's summary. The New York Times suggests that the length of the report raises questions about what Barr might have left out. However, Jim Geraghty, in today's Morning Jolt, argues that a lengthy report does not necessarily imply deception in Barr's summary. Geraghty points out that lengthy reports often come with an executive summary that is just a few pages long, and that the Attorney General did not undertake to summarize Mueller's full report; the purpose of his letter was to succinctly state Mueller's principal conclusions.\n\nThe Attorney General has pledged to release the report, in as complete a form as is legally and practically possible, in reasonably rapid fashion. The president seems to support, or at least not oppose, release as well. In writing his summary, the AG presumably was operating under the assumption that the report would be released, and that the public and the media would compare his summary with the final document.\n\nThe primary restriction that the Attorney General has cited for potential redactions is grand-jury secrecy rules. The grand-jury hurdle to disclosure is real, and IRA (Investigations and Reports Act) of 1970 requires the Attorney General to make the report available to Congress and the public, but with redactions to protect grand-jury material, ongoing investigations, and national security. The Attorney General has stated that he will release as much of the report as he can, while still complying with the law.\n\nThe grand-jury secrecy rules are a complex issue, and the Attorney General's ability to release the report without redactions may depend on the interpretation of these rules by the courts. The House, by a 420\u20130 margin, has already approved a resolution calling for the report to be made public. If there is a long delay in the release of the report, Republicans will likely face pressure to approve disclosure legislation, and the president will be under pressure to sign it. While some information might be withheld based on executive privilege, that privilege is constitutional and could be invoked even if a new disclosure law were enacted.\n\nFor now, the release of the Mueller report remains a topic of debate and speculation. The report will be substantially disclosed sooner rather than later, and it remains to be seen whether the Attorney General has faithfully described the report's conclusions, as many expect.",
    " Title: Former Senator Jim Webb Calls for Democratic Party to Focus on White, Working-Class Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Virginia Senator Jim Webb, a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election, has suggested that the Democratic Party should return to its roots of ensuring a voice for those without one in the corridors of power, including white, working-class individuals.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Webb stated, \"The Democratic party could do very well by returning to its Franklin Roosevelt/Harry Truman/Andrew Jackson roots, where the focus of the party was making sure that all people who lack a voice in the corridors of power could have one through their elected representatives.\"\n\nWebb expressed concern about the party's performance with white working-class voters, stating, \"I think they can do a better job with white working people, and I think this last election clearly showed that. If you look at the candidates that were getting beaten in areas where traditionally they had won \u2014 they [ were ] getting well less than 40 percent of the white vote.\"\n\nWebb, a Vietnam veteran and former secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, served a single term in the U.S. Senate before stepping down. He has formed an exploratory committee as he considers a 2016 run and has spoken and written throughout his career on the influence of his Scots-Irish ancestors on Appalachia.\n\nWhen asked about the high African-American voter turnout in past elections, Webb stated, \"You\u2019re not going to have a situation again where you have 96 percent of the African-American vote turning out for a presidential candidate \u2014 we need to get back to the message that was being developed, a return to the principles of the Democratic party that we are going to give everyone who needs access to the corridors of power that kind of access regardless of any of your antecedents.\"\n\nWebb also addressed economic issues, stating, \"I believe that if you look at our recovery, you will see that if you hold stocks \u2014 I hold stocks \u2014 you\u2019re doing fairly well under this recovery. The stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009. If you are simply a typical wage-earning American, you haven\u2019t really done that well \u2014 wages are actually flat and a little down.\"\n\nLoans to small businesses have also been down, according to Webb. He emphasized the need to address these issues and protect working people.\n\nIf he runs for president, NPR's Steve Inskeep noted, there will be a point during the primary season where Webb would have to address why he should be chosen over the current Democratic frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Webb responded, \"I really don\u2019t have an answer for you on that. She has not announced that she\u2019s running; I have not announced that I\u2019m running. If I were to run, it would not be sort of as a counter-point to her. I have issues that I care about, I want to put [them] on the table, and we\u2019ll see.\"",
    " Title: Obamacare Premium Increases Could Impact Midterm Elections in Key States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe increase in health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) may play a significant role in the upcoming midterm elections, particularly in states with competitive Senate races. In Louisiana and Iowa, double-digit rate hikes for individual health insurance plans have become a campaign issue, with Republican candidates criticizing their Democratic opponents for the premium increases.\n\nIn Louisiana, Representative Bill Cassidy has criticized the double-digit increases by some insurers, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, as \"another hurdle for families and businesses already struggling under the demands of Obamacare.\" In Iowa, Senate candidate Joni Ernst has used the sharp rate increases for two insurers to attack the Democratic candidate, Representative Bruce Braley, for supporting the law.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that premium increases are not universal across the country. In most states, premiums for coverage in the Obamacare health insurance exchanges for 2015 are rising at about the normal rate for health insurance throughout the country. In some places, they're even going down.\n\nStates like Alaska, where Democratic Senator Mark Begich is struggling to win a second term, are also facing significant premium increases. In these states, it's not all insurers that are raising rates that much. For example, in Louisiana, only rates for the insurers that are raising rates by 10 percent or more are being announced, making the public picture incomplete.\n\nIn an election year, a few states\u2014and a few insurers\u2014are enough, especially when they may serve to rekindle passions about a law that was already an Election Day concern for Democrats. Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, who has studied the premium trends around the country, stated, \"In general, the premium increases have been pretty modest. But there are exceptions, and the exceptions happen to be in states with competitive races.\"\n\nRepublican strategists have been waiting for the big premium increases to show up as an Obamacare \"October surprise.\" They've been hearing for months through their GOP policy expert contacts that the rate hikes were a possibility. The timing of the next enrollment season, which starts on Nov. 15, is such that the increases would become final around now.\n\nDemocrats are not too concerned, as the issue is not dominating the airwaves. With the Louisiana and Iowa Republican Senate candidates, it's been press statements and Twitter for now, although a conservative group did run a TV ad in Alaska that hit Senator Begich over the increases there.\n\nObama administration officials point out that even in the states with the biggest hikes, most customers won't see them. In Iowa, for example, premiums for the second-lowest-cost \"silver\" health insurance plans will go down by an average of 7 percent in Des Moines. They also note that the typical premiums for people who get Obamacare subsidies are pretty low to begin with. In Louisiana, for example, the average monthly premium was $68 this year for a \"silver\" plan.\n\nThe reason for the biggest rate hikes in competitive Senate races is not due to a conspiracy, but rather a result of the electoral math. The states with the biggest increases are usually the ones where the political leaders have resisted the Affordable Care Act and haven't done well at enrollment. And some of those states just happen to have the most competitive Senate races.\n\nA study by PwC's Health Research Institute, which researched premium data in 38 states and the District of Columbia, found that the average increase across states was just 6 percent. Only eight states had double-digit increases\u2014but those states included Louisiana and Iowa, as well as Kansas, where Republican Senator Pat Roberts is trying to head off a serious challenge from independent Greg Orman.",
    " Title: Obama Clarifies Scope of Executive Action on Immigration, Faces Protests at Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally held at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas on Friday, President Barack Obama clarified the scope of his recent executive action on immigration, stating that it does not apply to new undocumented immigrants. He emphasized that \"borders mean something\" and that the action does not apply to those who have recently entered the country or those who might come in the future.\n\nThe president's executive actions, signed on Friday, include shielding more immigrants from potential deportation and focusing deportations on individuals with criminal records. The actions have been met with opposition from Republicans in Congress, who argue that they will encourage more illegal immigration.\n\nRepublicans have criticized Obama's actions, citing a surge of illegal child immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border earlier this year. The president, however, dismissed the argument that his actions have made it more difficult to pass a comprehensive immigration bill.\n\n\"I understand that some of them are already saying that my actions sabotage their ability to pass a bill and make immigration work better,\" Obama said, laughing. \"Why? I didn't dissolve Parliament. That's not how our system works. I don't have a vote in Congress. Pass a bill. You don't need me to pass a bill.\"\n\nProtesters outside the high school held signs reading \"Impeach Obama\" and \"No Amnesty.\" Some chanted, \"Worst president ever, Obama!\" The president was interrupted several times with joyous chants of \"Si Se Puede\" and was heckled at one point by a young man who complained that the president's action did not include enough illegal immigrants.\n\nAstrid Silva, a woman who qualified for Obama's deferred action plan because she came to the U.S. illegally as a child, introduced the president. She criticized the inaction by the GOP on immigration, stating, \"House Republicans have refused to help me keep my dreams alive.\"\n\nThe president addressed concerns that his action is only applying to Hispanic immigrants, stating, \"Not everybody who comes here is Latino. I'm from Chicago. We've got some Irish immigrants whose papers are not in order. We've got some Polish immigrants whose papers are not in order. This is not just a Latino issue. This is an American issue.\"\n\nObama also acknowledged that his legal advisers told him that his authority was limited on immigration. \"Not everything that we want to do, we can do,\" he said. \"We should be creating new programs for farm workers. We should be adding visas for the high-tech sector. We should be creating a pathway to citizenship. But only Congress can do that.\"\n\nThe president received many letters from Americans urging him not to take these actions, expressing concerns about immigration changing the fabric of the country, taking jobs from hard-working Americans, and economic stress. However, he also received messages reminding him why he had to act, from American family members of hard-working immigrants who fear their families could be torn apart, from dreamers who had stepped out of the shadows, and from Republicans tired of their party refusing to vote on reform.\n\n\"We didn't raise the Statue of Liberty with her back to the world. We did it with her light shining as a beacon to the world,\" Obama said.",
    " Title: Cellphone Data Suggests Protesters at Anti-Lockdown Protests May Contribute to Coronavirus Spread\n\nArticle:\n\nA study of cellphone location data has suggested that demonstrators at anti-lockdown protests, some of which have been linked to Covid-19 cases, are traveling hundreds of miles to events and returning to various parts of their states and even neighboring ones. The data, provided to a campaign group called the Committee to Protect Medicare, indicates that the protests may contribute to the spread of the coronavirus in areas that have, so far, experienced relatively few infections.\n\nThe data, captured from opt-in cellphone apps, was analyzed by data scientists at the firm VoteMap. They determined the movements of devices present at protests in late April and early May in five states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado, and Florida.\n\nData scientist Jeremy Fair, executive-vice president of VoteMap, stated that many of the devices that are seen to reach state borders are seen to continue across them in the underlying raw data. One visualization shows that in Lansing, Michigan, after a 30 April protest where armed protesters stormed the capitol building, devices which had been present at the protest site can be seen returning to all parts of the state, from Detroit to remote towns in the state's north. One device visible in the data traveled to and from Afton, which is over 180 miles from the capital. Others reached, and some crossed, the Indiana border.\n\nIn the 48 hours following a 19 April \"Operation Gridlock\" protest in Denver, devices reached the borders of neighboring states including Wyoming, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Utah. In Florida on 18 April, devices returned to all parts of the peninsula and up to the Georgia border. In Wisconsin on 24 April, devices returned to smaller towns like Green Bay and Wausau, and the borders of Minnesota and Illinois.\n\nFollowing the initial wave of anti-lockdown protests in April, epidemiologists warned that they could lead to a new surge in cases. In North Carolina in late April, one of the leaders of the state's anti-lockdown protests tested positive for Covid-19 but said she would attend future rallies.\n\nDr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare, stated that although \"it's hard to draw a straight line between devices, individuals at these protests, and cases,\" the data suggests that the protests may be epidemiologically significant events. \"The behavior we're seeing at protests carries a high risk of infection. We can see protesters are going from a highly concentrated event and then dispersing widely,\" he added.\n\nDavidson, who has run for Congress as a Democrat, stated that neither he nor his advocacy group were currently affiliated with the Democratic party. The group is made up of more than 300 \"doctors who are concerned that the healthcare for their patients has become unaffordable.\"\n\nIn a series of widely shared videos and threads on Twitter, Davidson has criticized President Trump and attempted to dispel what he calls the \"distrust in public health\" which \"Donald Trump has fomented in his movement.\"",
    " Title: President Trump's Self-Pardon and Ongoing Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on June 4, 2018, President Donald Trump asserted that he has the constitutional right to pardon himself, but he has not expressed any intention to do so. This statement comes amidst the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has stated that while the president constitutionally has the power to pardon himself, it is unlikely due to the potential political ramifications. In an interview with ABC's \"This Week,\" Giuliani said, \"Pardoning other people is one thing; pardoning yourself is another.\"\n\nThe discussion about self-pardoning stems from a 20-page letter to special counsel Robert Mueller from Trump's former lawyer, John Dowd. The letter, which was recently leaked, argues that it is impossible for a president to obstruct justice and asserts that the president has the power to pardon.\n\nRepublican leaders, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), have suggested that the self-pardon issue is a distraction and that it's time to wrap up the investigation. McCarthy stated, \"I don't know why we're walking through hypotheticals here in this process. The president has never said he would pardon himself.\"\n\nThe president's frustration with the nearly 13-month investigation into the Russia probe boiled over on Twitter this weekend, with Trump tweeting, \"When will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end?\" He also expressed concern about potential leaks from the special counsel's office and the Department of Justice to the media.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Trump faces tensions with Canada over recently implemented tariffs and a high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12.",
    " Title: Trump's Bipartisan Wins: A Look at the President's Recent Legislative Achievements\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been lauded for his role in leading the bipartisan push for federal prison reform, culminating in the passage of the FIRST STEP Act. The law, signed in December, aims to reduce sentences for drug felonies and other non-violent crimes, limit the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, and allow prisoners to earn \"good time credits\" by participating in educational or training programs.\n\nThe President celebrated the new law, stating, \"This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it. In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved.\"\n\nThe FIRST STEP Act is not the only bipartisan victory for President Trump this year. In July, he signed legislation to renew a federal workforce development program that allows states to provide technical education and training for students to develop skills for good-paying jobs.\n\nIn September, President Trump again brought Democrats and Republicans together to draft the Protecting Patients From Surprise Medical Bills Act. This law guards patients from unexpected out-of-network bills and prohibits providers from charging patients for the difference if their insurance does not pay the full price of a given service or procedure.\n\nIn October, the President signed the SUPPORT For Patients and Communities Act, a sweeping legislation to confront the opioid crisis. The bill provides funding for treatment and recovery, increased security to keep dangerous drugs out of the country, monitoring of opioid prescriptions, and development of non-opioid painkillers, among other key provisions.\n\nThe Water Infrastructure Act, signed in the same month, ensures safe and secure drinking water systems across the nation and prevents a recurrence of the Flint, Michigan catastrophe. The bill received a nearly unanimous vote of 99-1 in the Senate.\n\nAccording to a May report by Quorum, 70 percent of the bills signed into law from this Congress have had at least one Democrat and one Republican sponsor, the highest level of bipartisanship in 20 years. The Trump administration's effectiveness at working across party lines demonstrates the potential for constructive bipartisan collaboration, especially as Democrats and Republicans prepare to share power and responsibility for the agenda of Congress in the new year.",
    " Title: US Intelligence Warns Bernie Sanders of Russian Interference in His Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that US intelligence officials have warned Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, that Russia is attempting to help his campaign. The news follows reports that intelligence officials recently briefed Congress about Russian interference aimed at helping reelect President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, both Sanders and President Trump were briefed on Russia's efforts. Sanders, in a statement to The Washington Post, said, \"I don't care, frankly, who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.\n\nJessica Brandt, head of policy and research for the Alliance for Securing Democracy, stated, \"All of this is part of Russia's much broader effort to cast democracies as feckless, ineffective, and corrupt.\"\n\nIn 2016, Russian misinformation agents and hackers worked to boost Trump's electoral chances while also throwing some support behind Sanders as he ran against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's definitive look at Russian interference concluded that the IRA's left-leaning accounts focused their efforts on denigrating Clinton and supporting either fellow Democrat candidate Bernie Sanders or Green Party candidate Jill Stein, at the expense of Hillary Clinton.\n\nClint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who studies Russian interference efforts, stated, \"The Kremlin's strategy for a year has been very straightforward. They would like to see Trump reelected.\"\n\nRussia has already gone after Biden aggressively, likely hacking into Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company whose connection to Hunter Biden has been the focus of a conspiratorial narrative by Trump and his allies. Moscow's disinformation efforts in support of Sanders once again focused on Iowa, whose caucus earlier this month was beset by technical difficulties.\n\nJessica Brandt of the Alliance for Securing Democracy said, \"We saw Russia amplifying conspiracy theories suggesting that delays in reporting returns were part of an effort to deny Senator Sanders a clear win. We also saw them highlighting theories purporting murky ties between other candidates and the company that created the caucus app.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the activity tracked by the Alliance for Securing Democracy led directly to the intel briefings being reported on this week. Sanders told The New York Times Friday that he was briefed a month ago, which would be before the Iowa fallout. However, it does speak to what experts say is Russia's ultimate goal, which is less about Sanders and more about promoting chaos. The point has always been to find democracy's loose seams, and pull.",
    " Title: U.S. and North Korea Leaders Meet for Second Summit in Hanoi, Seeking Progress on Denuclearization\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un began their second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Wednesday, with the U.S. side seeking tangible steps by North Korea towards dismantling its nuclear weapons program. The two leaders will be accompanied by two aides and interpreters during their discussions, which come eight months after their historic summit in Singapore.\n\nTrump arrived in Hanoi on Air Force One late on Tuesday, while Kim traveled by train from Pyongyang, crossing the border from China by train and completing the final stretch by car. The leaders will have a 20-minute one-on-one conversation before a dinner scheduled to last just over an hour and a half.\n\nThe summit follows the first meeting in Singapore last June, where the two leaders aimed to break the ice after decades of bitter animosity between their two countries. This time, there is pressure to move beyond the vaguely worded commitment by Kim to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\n\nTrump's critics at home have urged him to avoid cutting a deal that would do little to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, while Kim is expected to seek significant U.S. concessions such as relief from sanctions and a declaration that the Korean War is at last formally over.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday and met with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh for talks. While Trump is in Hanoi, his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is testifying before U.S. congressional committees, with the president's business practices the main focus. Anticipation has also been rising about the impending release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, though a senior U.S. Justice Department official said on Friday it would not come this week.\n\nSome analysts fear that Trump may be under pressure at home to show progress on a foreign policy issue that has confounded multiple predecessors, which could lead him to make concessions that leave the United States less secure. The two sides might agree to a formal end of the Korean War, a move long sought by North Korea, as the war concluded with an armistice, rather than a peace treaty.",
    " Title: Growing Faction of Second Amendment Purists Challenges NRA Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nA faction of gun rights activists, often referred to as \"gundamentalists,\" has emerged within the National Rifle Association (NRA), posing a challenge to the organization's leadership and its ability to maintain moderate support and make potential compromises on gun control measures. This group, which has grown in influence, is demanding that the NRA's leadership remain firm against gun control advocates, according to interviews with gun-rights activists, policy experts, and gun-control advocates.\n\nAdam Kraut, a gun rights lawyer, fell short of the 71,000 votes needed for election to the NRA's board in May, but earned 5,000 more votes than the previous year, signifying the growth of Second Amendment purists within the NRA. This group is known for their staunch support of gun rights and opposition to any form of gun control.\n\nThe rise of this faction has caused internal pressure within the NRA, threatening the organization's ability to retain moderate supporters and make compromises that could help fend off tougher gun control measures. The NRA has faced internal divisions before, with an internal revolt at the 1977 meeting in Cincinnati transforming the organization from a polite, sport-shooting group into a powerful political lobby.\n\nThe NRA leadership has reportedly put up obstacles to Kraut's election, using bylaws that make it harder for candidates not endorsed by the nominating committee to be elected to the board, and enlisting a senior member to campaign against him. Marion Hammer, a past president of the NRA and one of the group's most successful lobbyists, criticized unsanctioned candidates in a column on the website Ammoland. Although Hammer did not name Kraut, he was one of only two non-approved candidates to run.\n\nThe protesters, who marched through the NRA's annual meeting in Dallas in May, were predominantly white men, including bearded outdoorsmen and buttoned-down libertarians. Some concealed their \"NRA = Not Real Activists\" T-shirts while entering the convention hall for fear of being banned by NRA security.\n\nKraut, 31, practices firearms law in suburban Philadelphia and hosts a video blog called The Legal Brief on The Gun Collective, a YouTube channel. He has campaigned for the NRA to push for more expansive gun-rights laws and to renew its leadership by changing NRA bylaws, such as imposing term limits for board members and mandatory meeting attendance.\n\nOne of Kraut's most prominent supporters, Tim Harmsen, who led the pro-Kraut march through the convention center, has 770,000 subscribers to the Military Arms Channel on YouTube, where he criticizes the NRA for being weak on gun laws. \"We're going to continue to apply pressure (on the NRA) every way that we can through social media, and we'll be there again next year,\" Harmsen said.\n\nThese hardline gun-rights activists deeply cherish their right to keep and bear arms, as protected by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. They oppose any form of gun control, arguing that criminals will find ways around gun laws, which only strip lawful gun owners of the right to self-defense and protection against state tyranny.\n\nThe gun-rights purists are outraged by any concessions the NRA makes in the wake of mass shootings, even if these concessions are made to avoid stricter gun control laws. Opinion polls, such as a regular Gallup survey, show growing support for gun control in recent years. However, support for gun control typically spikes immediately after mass shootings, then falls closer to pre-massacre levels within a few months.\n\nAfter a shooter killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas last year, the NRA supported federal regulation of bump stocks, accessories that the gunman used to fire his semiautomatic rifles more quickly. The Justice Department then ordered an effective ban that is close to being finalized.\n\nAmid nationwide protests that followed a Florida high school shooting that killed 17 people in February, the NRA endorsed strengthening background checks for gun purchasers and emergency protection orders that allow law-enforcement officials to temporarily take guns away from people deemed dangerous.\n\n\"For us, some of the things that come out of NRA headquarters are just outrageous and abhorrent,\" said Jeff Knox, a Kraut supporter whose father, Neal Knox, led the \"Revolt at Cincinnati\" in 1977. \"It's: Holy cow, what are these guys thinking?\" The NRA and Marion Hammer did not respond to requests to address the influence of the gundamentalists and the criticism that these activists and other gun-rights groups directed at the lobby.",
    " Title: Trump-Russia Investigation and Iran-US Tensions: Analysis of Recent Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape in the United States has been marked by two significant developments: the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged contacts with Russians and the escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, culminating in the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian military commander.\n\nThe Trump administration's contacts with Russians during the 2016 election campaign have been a subject of controversy. Critics argue that the appointment of U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the origins of the investigation is politically motivated, while supporters maintain that the investigation into the Trump campaign was justified given the numerous contacts between Trump officials and Russians.\n\nThe investigation, according to reports, uncovered contacts between Trump's son, son-in-law, campaign chairman, personal lawyer, future national security adviser, future attorney general, and others with Russians. The counterintelligence investigators, concerned about Russian activities and the potential impact of the investigation on the election, proceeded with caution, keeping the investigation secret until after the election.\n\nThe Steele Dossier, a largely unconfirmed report on early Russian efforts to influence Trump, has been a point of contention. Trump supporters argue that the Steele Dossier's citation in a footnote of the FISA application undermines the investigation's legitimacy. However, it is important to note that the FISA application disclosed that the Steele Dossier had received funding from those \"likely looking for information to discredit\" the Trump campaign, and the surveillance on Carter Page was renewed multiple times, including by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee.\n\nThe assassination of Qassem Soleimani, a powerful Iranian military leader, has led to increased tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The main question about the strike isn't moral or legal\u2014it's strategic. Soleimani was not a terror kingpin, and his death doesn't decapitate anything. The only reason to kill Soleimani, according to some analysts, is to enter a new war that the U.S. can win. However, there are concerns about the strategic implications of the strike, including the potential for Iran to retaliate and the impact on U.S. allies.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strike, it is crucial for influential Republican senators to remind President Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and prevent further escalation of conflict with Iran. The U.S. must carefully consider the potential consequences of its actions and the credibility of its intelligence in the region.",
    " Title: Graham Threatens to Delay Obama's Defense and CIA Nominees Over Benghazi Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has threatened to delay the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominees for secretary of defense and CIA director, John Brennan and Chuck Hagel, unless the Obama administration provides more information about its response to the September 2012 attack on an American diplomatic post in Libya.\n\nDuring an interview on CBS on Sunday, Graham stated, \"I do not think we should allow Brennan to go forward with the CIA directorship, Hagel to be confirmed for secretary of defense, until the White House gives us an accounting.\" Graham questioned whether the president had taken any action to help those affected by the attack and demanded to know if the president had contacted any Libyan government officials.\n\nPreviously, Graham had threatened to put a hold on Hagel's nomination unless outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified before Congress on the Benghazi attacks. Panetta testified last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, stating that, without direct warning or advance intelligence of the September 11, 2012, attack, there was no way for the military to respond in time.\n\nGraham, along with other Republicans, has also criticized the Obama administration's initial response to the attack, particularly the appearance of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice less than a week later on Sunday talk shows, where she blamed the attack on anger generated by an anti-Muslim video. Rice has since explained her remarks as derived from administration talking points, which Graham said on Sunday had not yet been sufficiently explained.\n\n\"I want to know who changed the talking points. Who took the references to al Qaeda out of the talking points given to Susan Rice?\" said Graham, specifying that he would not filibuster the nominees but rather hold them up until more information is disclosed.\n\nSenator John McCain, a close Republican ally of Graham's in the Senate, said Monday he would not support a filibuster of Hagel, which would be unprecedented for a president's Cabinet nominee.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Sunday in response to Graham's comments that the White House believes \"the Senate should act swiftly to confirm John Brennan and Sen. Hagel. These are critical national security positions, and individual members should not play politics with their nominations.\"",
    " Title: Vacant Senior Positions in the State Department Pose Challenges for Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is facing criticism for the lack of ambassadors in key countries as tensions escalate with North Korea, a situation that could potentially impact the U.S.'s response to the nuclear crisis. According to Evelyn Cheng of CNBC, there are more than 100 senior positions vacant in the State Department, including ambassadors to South Korea, China, Japan, India, and Australia.\n\nAs of Friday, no nominee for the South Korean ambassador has been considered. The nominee for the Tokyo embassy was not selected until March and has not been confirmed yet. The nomination for the Beijing embassy, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, foundered in the Senate due to the Trump administration's inability to complete necessary paperwork.\n\nThe issue of vacant positions in the State Department has raised concerns about the administration's ability to handle foreign policy matters effectively. The lack of ambassadors in key countries could hinder communication and coordination with relevant authorities in those countries during critical situations.\n\nThe Trump administration's approach to governing has been compared to running a business, a tradition that dates back to the desire to \"run the government like a business.\" However, the government is not a business, and it makes little sense to try to run it like one. The government is a unique entity with its own set of challenges and responsibilities that cannot be compared to a business or a nonprofit organization.\n\nDonald Trump, as a businessman, has faced criticism for his lack of experience in running large organizations. His attempts to run large businesses, such as the Trump Taj Mahal and the Plaza Hotel, have ended in bankruptcy. Trump's career has primarily consisted of licensing deals and media appearances, which are very different from running a large corporation like Microsoft or Ford.\n\nThe skills required to run a business are not necessarily transferable to the public sector, and especially not to the presidency. The president proposes a policy agenda and works to forge a political consensus to support it, working with Congress to implement it through legislation. Trump is not doing that. Instead, he is putting on public spectacles and tweeting.\n\nThe lack of a clear policy agenda and the inability to implement it effectively has been evident in the ongoing debate over healthcare reform, where Republicans, who control the presidency, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, are struggling to pass a bill.\n\nThe Trump administration's failure to fill key positions in the bureaucracy has also raised concerns about the administration's ability to implement its policies. The proverb \"Personnel is policy\" highlights the importance of having the right people in place to carry out a policy agenda. The Trump administration's lack of personnel in key positions could hinder the implementation of its policies and lead to a lack of coordination and communication within the government.",
    " Title: White House Power Couple's Disagreements with President Trump: A Chronicle\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relationship between President Donald Trump and his advisers, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, has reportedly been strained on several occasions, with their disagreements often making headlines.\n\nThis week, The New York Times reported, citing an anonymous source, that Kushner and Ms. Trump had urged the president to denounce the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, more forcefully. The report came after Trump defended his statements on the matter.\n\n\"You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides... If you reported it accurately, you would say that,\" Trump said to an angry media scrum.\n\nThis is not the first time President Trump has upset his daughter and son-in-law, only for it to inexplicably find its way to the media. Here are five other instances where the power couple and the president have disagreed:\n\n1. In October 2016, tapes emerged in which President Trump was heard making crude comments about women. The Washington Post leaked the tapes, which nearly derailed Trump's campaign and upset Ivanka Trump. According to The New York Times, she made an emphatic case for a full-throated apology.\n\n2. In June 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would pull back from the Paris climate agreement. It was reported that Ivanka and Jared were not pleased, with Politico citing sources saying that the pair were taking it in their stride.\n\n3. In January 2017, Kushner was reportedly \"furious\" that his efforts were being \"undermined\" by the President of the United States, according to Vanity Fair. The outlet pointed to a meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, which Kushner was trying to arrange.\n\n4. In February 2017, news reached Politico that the pair helped kill off an order that would have overturned a 2014 Obama-era executive order preventing LGBT discrimination in the workplace. The White House downplayed the move, saying it was one of hundreds of draft orders being considered.\n\n5. In August 2017, President Trump tweeted that he would not allow trans-identifying people to serve in the military.

    " Title: Political Parties in Disarray: A Neutral Analysis of the Current State of the Republican and Democratic Parties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States political landscape is currently witnessing a significant level of dysfunction within both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nThe Republican Party, which currently controls the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, is facing internal strife due to a combination of ideological, political, and structural issues. The party's dysfunctionality is not only evident in its day-to-day operations but also in the unpredictable behavior of its president, who often captures public attention like a spider monkey in a church with a lit stick of dynamite.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democratic Party appears to be preoccupied with the spectacle of the Republican Party's dysfunction. In a metaphor reminiscent of a drunken individual, the Democratic Party seems oblivious to its own decrepitude, shouting at the television and boasting about its potential for improvement.\n\nFormer Democratic Party functionary Donna Brazile, who served as interim chair in the lead-up to the 2016 election, has revealed in an excerpt from her forthcoming book that the party was in significant debt and was essentially taken over by Hillary Clinton. According to Brazile, the Clinton campaign, through Debbie Wasserman Schultz, controlled the party's messaging and hiring, while raising millions ostensibly for the party but ultimately funneling the funds back into the Clinton campaign's coffers.\n\nThe Democratic Party's current unifying principle is its opposition to President Donald Trump. However, when it comes to ideas about governing, the party's passion is primarily focused on two areas: Senator Bernie Sanders' idea of \"socialism\" and the angry, sanctimony-besotted identity politics popular on college campuses and certain left-wing websites.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee's data-services manager recently sent out an email soliciting applications for new hires in the IT department. In the email, she cautioned that she was not looking for \"cisgender straight white males.\" This could potentially alienate a significant portion of the electorate, particularly working-class men who feel disenfranchised by the party.\n\nThe Republican Party, meanwhile, is also facing criticism for its handling of various issues. The party's current state could be seen as a reflection of its inability to adapt to changing societal norms and the increasing diversity of the American electorate.\n\nIn conclusion, both political parties are currently grappling with significant internal issues, and their ability to effectively govern and represent the American people is being called into question. The current state of the parties could potentially lead to a shift in the political landscape, with new ideas and leaders emerging to challenge the status quo.",
    " Title: \"The Role of Evaluation Apprehension in Political Opinion Polling: A Social Psychological Perspective\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe concept of \"things seldom being what they seem\" is a recurring theme in literature, and it appears to be a relevant factor in political opinion polling as well. In a recent article, the author argues that the election polls during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign were influenced by a phenomenon known as \"evaluation apprehension.\"\n\nEvaluation apprehension, a term coined by the author, refers to an anxiety-induced concern about being positively or negatively judged. This state can influence individuals' responses, particularly in political opinion surveys, where respondents may want to please or avoid displeasing the interviewer, especially when discussing political preferences.\n\nIn the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential race, the near-unanimous rejection and derogation of Donald Trump by the media could have triggered evaluation apprehension among Trump supporters, leading to disingenuous responses when expressing their presidential preference. This effect might not have been universal, but it could have been significant enough to skew the data in an inaccurate direction.\n\nAnother factor that compounded the problem was the release of the Access Hollywood video, which showed Trump making controversial comments about his sexual behavior. The subsequent dip in Trump's poll numbers was expected, but his rebound after a few days suggested a connection with a substantial and aggrieved sector of the voting public that the pollsters and commentators are only now acknowledging.\n\nThe author suggests that a more detailed understanding of public opinion polling would improve political journalism. If journalists had a better grasp of the art (or science, as it is never can be), they would avoid making inaccurate predictions or overly confident assertions.\n\nThe author also points out that the error limits calculated statistically in polls are meant to reflect sampling errors, discarded respondents, quota excesses, or poor interviewer performance. These errors are assumed to be randomly distributed rather than one-sided. However, the activation of evaluation apprehension can cause a one-sided tilting of data, which is not easily accounted for in quick cell phone conversations with respondents.\n\nThe author concludes by emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the psychological factors that influence political opinion polling. This understanding could provide insights into the reasons behind the election of a candidate like Donald Trump, who was perceived as a longshot by many pollsters and commentators. The author calls for future historians and journalists to delve deeper into the factors that led half of the electorate to support a candidate who, in their view, got \"so far beyond the windmills.\"",
    " Title: Trump Outlines Plans for \"Renewal of the American Spirit\" in Joint Address to Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to deliver a joint address to Congress on Tuesday, outlining his plans for a \"renewal of the American spirit\" through his economic goals and priorities. The speech, which will reportedly strike an optimistic tone, is intended to present the president's vision for addressing real-world problems and reset the turbulent first month of his presidency.\n\nAccording to senior administration officials, the speech will emphasize the theme of renewal, with Trump explaining how his administration aims to solve problems for the American people. He is expected to address the backlash to his immigration and travel ban, struggles to develop a replacement healthcare plan, turnover in his national security team, and allegations of ties between his administration and Russia.\n\nAs of Monday evening, the president was still working with speechwriters to finalize the speech. The content of the speech is a departure from the dark tone of his inaugural address, which promised to stop \"American carnage.\" This new speech, delivered just over a month later, is the result of listening sessions and meetings with healthcare professionals, law enforcement, union representatives, coal miners, and others.\n\nThe speech will focus on two key themes of Trump's campaign and early presidency: growing economic opportunity and protecting the American people. In an interview on Fox News, Trump attributed messaging problems for his rocky first month in office, stating, \"I think I get an A in terms of what I've actually done, but in terms of messaging, I'd give myself a C or a C+.\"\n\nTrump also expressed confidence that a revitalized economy would fund the $54 billion increase in defense spending he is proposing. \"I mean you look at the kind of numbers we're doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than 1 percent, and if I can get that up to 3 or maybe more, we have a whole different ball game,\" he said. The Commerce Department puts the GDP at 1.6% for 2016.\n\nSenior administration officials described Tuesday's speech as an optimistic look forward to what Trump hopes to accomplish in office. The president will also review the promises he made to the American people and argue for what he has kept so far, pointing to his executive orders and memos. National security and foreign policy will also be a significant part of the speech, with Trump expected to issue a new executive order this week regarding his travel ban. The new order is expected to provide more detail and not affect green card holders.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Discusses Russia's Election Interference and U.S. Response on CNN's \"State of the Union\"\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-KY) stated on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that it is a mistake to hold Russia accountable for its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, suggesting that many countries, including the U.S., have attempted to meddle in foreign elections.\n\n\"They're another country. They're going to spy on us. They do spy on us. They're going to interfere in our elections. We also do the same,\" said Sen. Paul. He emphasized the importance of protecting the integrity of U.S. elections, stating that the focus should be on ensuring the electoral process is secure rather than attributing blame for past election interference.\n\nSen. Paul also suggested that, from Russia's perspective, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, was responsible for some meddling during the Obama administration. He clarified that he was not equating the two in terms of moral equivalence but acknowledged that this is how Russia responds.\n\nAhead of President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, Sen. Paul expressed doubt that the Russians would admit their involvement in the 2016 election interference, comparing it to the U.S.'s reluctance to admit its influence in campaigns in other countries' elections.\n\nSen. Paul considered the recent indictment of 12 Russian military officers for allegedly stealing Democratic emails and interfering in the 2016 election a \"good thing,\" but he believed the Department of Justice could have investigated the matter without a special counsel. He expressed the view that if there is proof of Russian interference, the focus should shift to protecting the U.S. from future foreign interference rather than pursuing a \"witch hunt\" on President Trump.\n\nSen. Paul stated that there is \"no evidence\" so far that President Trump has been personally involved in the election interference. He concluded by expressing the need to move past the investigation and focus on protecting U.S. elections from foreign interference.",
    " Title: Texas State Troopers Begin Asking Motorists Race and Ethnicity to Improve Data Accuracy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the discovery of inaccurate racial identification of drivers, particularly Hispanics, during traffic stops due to flaws in an automated system meant to prevent racial profiling, Texas state troopers have begun asking motorists their race and ethnicity.\n\nDepartment of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw testified before a state House committee that the change took effect on Wednesday, aiming to collect more accurate data. McCraw stated, \"What we can do better, and what we should have been doing better, is collect the data accurately as it relates to Hispanics. Plain and simple... I would rather a trooper not have to ask, but if the data does not work... there is a problem.\"\n\nKXAN-TV in Austin conducted a database review using millions of records going back to 2010, which showed troopers across the state inaccurately reported the race of Hispanic drivers. The television station's investigation of DPS traffic citation records also found that the number of drivers stopped by troopers and recorded as Hispanic has increased annually since 2010\u2014from nearly 208,000 to 351,000 last year\u2014while the number of drivers recorded as white declined in the same time period from 1.9 million to about 1.2 million last year, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAmong the most common surnames of drivers listed by troopers as white are Garcia, Martinez, Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Rodriguez. However, a Hispanic name does not necessarily mean a person is of Hispanic descent. The review of DPS records showed more than 1.9 million drivers with traditionally Hispanic names were listed as white, while over the same period, approximately 1.6 million were reported as Hispanic.\n\nTo prevent racial profiling, state law requires authorities to document the race of drivers who are arrested, issued warnings, or citations. However, McCraw testified that coding on drivers' licenses only allowed for identification as Hispanic since 2010. Prior to that time, Hispanic motorists were often identified as white.\n\nMcCraw testified that he did not know how much it would cost to fix the automated system, leaving no other remedy but to direct troopers to specifically ask for the information. \"Officers will advise the individual that the officer is required by law to inquire as to the individual\u2019s race or ethnicity,\" a DPS memo outlining the new policy stated. \"The officer will record the race or ethnicity as stated by the motorist. Only in cases where an individual refuses to provide the requested information and the database reflects their race or ethnicity as 'other,' will the officer use best judgment or ability to determine the race or ethnicity of the motorist.\"\n\nDespite the current lack of data, McCraw maintained that the agency does not tolerate racial profiling. \"Bottom line, it's against the law,\" he said. \"There is no racial profiling within the DPS.\"",

    " Title: Ronan Farrow Discusses Matt Lauer's Firing and Allegations in Upcoming Book on \"Good Morning America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nRonan Farrow made his first television appearance since excerpts from his upcoming book, \"Catch and Kill,\" revealed new details surrounding Matt Lauer's 2017 firing. In an interview on \"Good Morning America,\" Farrow stood by his book, which is set to be released next week, despite Lauer calling the reporting in \"Catch and Kill\" false and defamatory.\n\nDuring the interview, Farrow alleged that there were previous accusations brought to NBC regarding Lauer's conduct before the 2017 complaint that led to his ouster. Farrow, however, could not reveal specific details about conversations with his sources or if he spoke with Lauer. He stated that the former \"Today\" show co-host's \"way of thinking\" is represented in the book, and everything printed \"extensively fact-checked.\"\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos then referenced NBC's statement about the rape allegation in Farrow's book. The network stated Lauer was fired within 24 hours of NBC learning about the complaint in 2017, and any suggestions of NBC trying to cover up for Lauer are \"false and offensive.\"\n\nFarrow claimed that he spent years reporting and fact-checking the claims made in his book, and what he found goes against NBC's statement. He said, years before Lauer's 2017 firing, over a six to seven-year period, there were seven non-disclosure agreements at the network, multiple of which involved Lauer.\n\nFarrow also added that he spoke with NBC senior executives who were made aware of those earlier settlements. NBC issued a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 in response to Farrow's \"Good Morning America\" interview, reiterating NBC News Chairman Andy Lack's memo, shared earlier this week, that stated the first NBC heard about allegations of sexual misconduct against Lauer was on the night of November 27, 2017, and he was fired 24 hours after.\n\nThe statement added NBC Universal's legal team has conducted interviews and did an exhaustive search of available records and found no claims or settlements that suggest inappropriate conduct by Lauer prior to his 2017 firing. The network stated after his termination is when NBC reached an agreement with two women.\n\nOn Tuesday, news broke that Farrow's book includes new details about the allegation that caused Lauer's firing. Brooke Nevils, the previously unnamed accuser at the center of Lauer's fall from grace, is identified in the book, and \"Catch and Kill\" delves into details of Nevils' allegation that Lauer raped her during the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nIn a lengthy letter provided by his lawyer to Variety, Lauer denied the allegation and painted the picture of an accusation full of contradictions. He said he has shied away until now from speaking out on the \"false and salacious allegations\" against him to protect his children.\n\n\"I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period,\" Lauer wrote. \"My silence has been a mistake. Old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made. All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It\u2019s outrageous. So, after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support I say 'enough.'\"\n\nNevils stepped forward with a tweet Wednesday. \"I want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support. It takes courage, and I am truly grateful,\" she wrote.\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, she said she asked NBC to thoroughly investigate her allegations and to give Lauer \"the opportunity to defend himself.\" She also said she provided \"dates, times, evidence of communications and corroborating accounts\" to back up her accusations and \"both NBC and Farrow found me credible.\"\n\nShe continued: \"There's the Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades, and there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence. His open letter was a case study in victim blaming... I am not afraid of him now, regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would (and now has) tried to use against me.\"",
    " Title: Operation Fast and Furious: Inspector General Report Faults Multiple Agencies, Calls for Disciplinary Action\n\n Article:\n\n The Inspector General's report on Operation Fast and Furious, a failed anti-gunrunning probe, has led to the resignation of one Justice Department official and the retirement of another, with 14 more officials facing possible disciplinary action. The report, which faults a range of agencies for their handling of the operation, has sparked calls for further action from Republican lawmakers.\n\n At a hearing on Thursday, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, stated that \"all 14\" officials should leave the department. Other lawmakers have suggested senior officials, particularly criminal division chief Lanny Breuer, should face discipline.\n\n The report, which is the most comprehensive account yet on the deadly operation, accused officials of a \"disregard\" for public safety. It details how weapons allowed to \"walk\" across the U.S.-Mexico border resulted in hundreds of firearms turning up at crime scenes in both countries.\n\n The report states that Attorney General Eric Holder was not made aware of potential flaws in the program until February of last year. However, lawmakers have pointed to a section of the findings that suggests wiretap applications should have raised \"red flags\" for those who reviewed them, contradicting Holder's earlier testimony.\n\n The report states: \"We reviewed the wiretap affidavits in both Operation Wide Receiver and Operation Fast and Furious and concluded that the affidavits in both cases included information that would have caused a prosecutor who was focused on the question of investigative tactics, particularly one who was already sensitive to the issue of 'gun walking,' to have questions about ATF's conduct of the investigations.\"\n\n Inspector General Michael Horowitz repeated this claim during Thursday's hearing, stating: \"If you were focused and looking at the question of gunwalking you would read these reports and see many red flags.\"\n\n Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said Holder's testimony from earlier this year was a \"direct contradiction\" to that. Holder had stated that he did not see anything in the affidavits that would indicate gunwalking was allowed.\n\n Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said that in light of Holder's testimony, the IG's conclusion was \"startling.\"\n\n The Justice Department official said Holder's statements to Congress were accurate, noting that \"the affidavits do not explicitly and clearly say gun-walking\" and claiming the IG report does not allege that either.\n\n Gowdy also questioned how employees under Breuer were being disciplined while Breuer so far has not been in any serious way. The IG report criticized Breuer for not notifying Holder about Operation Wide Receiver, the prior Bush-era gunwalking investigation, when he first learned about it in 2010.\n\n A DOJ official told Fox News that Breuer was \"admonished\" by Holder last year, but no further action is considered to be warranted. An employee under Breuer, Jason Weinstein, the deputy assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division, resigned after the IG investigation. The report marked him as the highest-ranking DOJ employee in a position to stop the program, though Weinstein disputed that conclusion.\n\n Attorney General Eric Holder stated that those found responsible for roles in the operation \"have been referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions.\" The department said it could not reveal more details at this time.\n\n On Capitol Hill Thursday, lawmakers and the inspector general joined in assailing the entire operation as misguided and poorly supervised. The report details a \"pattern of serious failures\" with the program. No \"serious question or concern\" about the operation was raised by anyone responsible for the case in the U.S. attorney's office or Phoenix division of ATF, according to the report. Further, it states that investigators found no \"persuasive evidence\" that supervisors raised concerns about the safety risk or the delay in arresting people who were buying and trafficking these firearms. The report also criticizes flaws in Operation Wide Receiver, the Bush administration-era predecessor to Fast and Furious. The Fast and Furious program caught the attention of Congress and the rest of the country after weapons from Fast and Furious were found at the crime scene of murdered Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.",

The process of withdrawal will take a year, and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has pledged to reverse the decision should he win in November.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the administration's top infectious disease expert, stated this week that the country is \"still knee-deep in the first wave\" of the Covid-19 pandemic, with over 131,000 deaths and infection numbers rising at a rate of around 50,000 per day. In a reversal of President Donald Trump's migration rhetoric, some border towns in northern Mexico are now trying to stop people crossing from the US, for fear they could spread the virus.\n\nIn Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has insisted he is \"doing fine\" after testing positive for Covid-19. Like Trump, Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for his lack of response to the disease, which has killed more people in Brazil than in any other country besides the US.\n\nThe WHO has acknowledged fresh evidence of airborne transmission of the virus, saying Covid-19 may spread more widely in the air than the organization previously suggested.\n\nCovid-19 patients with mild symptoms could suffer serious brain disorders, according to neurologists who have studied 40 UK patients with complications ranging from brain inflammation to strokes.\n\nThe US government is attempting to claw back the $80 million it loaned to Planned Parenthood under the coronavirus aid program, following criticism from conservative lawmakers. However, Christian anti-abortion groups have also received millions in taxpayer-backed loans.\n\nSome 5,600 fossil fuel companies have collectively accepted $3 billion in federal coronavirus aid amid the crisis, according to an analysis by Documented and \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nKanye West's company Yeezy LLC received between $2 million and $5 million in coronavirus aid loans, raising questions about conflict of interest, given the rapper and designer's ties to the Trump administration.\n\nIn other news, Mary Trump, Donald Trump's niece and Fred Trump's granddaughter, has written a book about the \"malignantly dysfunctional\" Trump family, detailing her fear and frustration with the Trump presidency.\n\nThe FBI claims that China is pursuing hundreds of Chinese nationals living in the US, trying to force dissidents and critics of the Beijing government to return home. In Hong Kong, the unofficial pro-democracy anthem Glory to Hong Kong has been banned in schools amid sweeping new national security laws imposed from Beijing.\n\nMore than 3.5 million people have been advised to evacuate in Japan, after torrential rains and flooding that have already claimed at least 58 lives.\n\nFacebook boycott organizers are \"disappointed\" after a meeting with Mark Zuckerberg, in which the social network's CEO and other executives failed to commit to concrete solutions for addressing hate speech and misinformation on the platform.\n\nChechens across Europe are fearful following the killings of several dissidents and critics of the Chechen president, Ramzan Kadyrov. The latest victim is 43-year-old Mamikhan Umarov, who was shot dead in Vienna on Saturday.\n\nNine in ten Americans say racism and police brutality are problems in the country, according to a poll conducted by Opinium for \u2588\u2588\u2588, suggesting Trump is increasingly out of step with public opinion.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, the socialite arrested last week on sex trafficking charges over her association with the late Jeffrey Epstein, has been photographed with numerous high-profile individuals, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Princess Diana, as chronicled by a popular new Instagram account.\n\nIn a positive note, a team of young people in Paris is tending to the world's largest urban farm, growing up to 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables without soil.

    " Title: House Passes Nonbinding War Powers Resolution to Restrict Presidential Actions Against Iran\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has approved a nonbinding war powers resolution that requires President Donald Trump to seek Congressional consent before engaging in new military action against Iran. The vote, which took place nearly a week after the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, was mostly along party lines, with only three Republicans and one independent joining Democrats to pass the measure. Eight Democrats opposed it.\n\nThe resolution, sponsored by Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former CIA analyst who worked on Middle East policy, was written as a concurrent resolution, which is traditionally considered nonbinding and does not require the president's signature. The Senate could consider a similar measure, but one with the force of law, as early as next week. However, it is unclear if it has enough votes to clear the chamber.\n\nThe Trump administration officials maintain that the president already has the authority to take action against Iran under a 2002 war authorization passed by Congress in response to the September 11 attacks. The concerns touch on a years-long discussion over whether the president's war powers are outdated.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said ahead of the resolution's passage, \"We are taking this path because it does not require... a signature of the president of the United States. This is a statement of the Congress of the United States, and I will not have that statement be diminished by whether the president will veto it or not.\"\n\nThe White House has strongly opposed the House war powers measure, with White House Spokesman Hogan Gidley stating, \"These Congressional actions are completely misguided... In fact, this ridiculous resolution is just another political move because, under well-established Supreme Court precedent, it's non-binding and lacks the force of law.\"\n\nThe concerns over the war powers measure come after briefings for lawmakers on Wednesday left many Democrats and some Republicans unhappy with a lack of transparency about what fueled the decision to strike the Iranian general. President Trump addressed the vote at a campaign rally Thursday night in Toledo, Ohio, and mocked the idea of consulting Congress while carrying out an operation like the killing of Soleimani.\n\nSome Senate Republicans have expressed interest in recent days to support a similar measure in their chamber. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who is sponsoring the war powers resolution, says he could bring up his measure for a vote as early as Tuesday. However, it may have to be coordinated with a potential trial if articles of impeachment are sent to the chamber beforehand. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) have already said they will support the measure, and Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) have also been in talks with Kaine about the legislation and could line up support.",
    " Title: Bloomberg's Presidential Campaign and Ad Spending Plans Amidst Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nPresidential candidate Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman and media mogul, has stated that if he does not win the Democratic presidential nomination, he will spend money to support the eventual nominee, contradicting President Trump's claim that Bloomberg would spend little on the Democratic candidate. In a tweet on Thursday, President Trump suggested that Bloomberg is using his rivals in the Democratic primary as a distraction for his own campaign.\n\nBloomberg, however, has repeatedly stated his intention to back the eventual nominee, regardless of whether he captures the nomination. In a statement to NBC News, Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, said, \"Mike Bloomberg is either going to be the nominee or the most important person supporting the Democratic nominee for president. He is dedicated to getting Trump out of the White House.\"\n\nBloomberg, through a super PAC, has already spent $100 million on digital ads attacking President Trump in crucial general election battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. These ads, which do not feature Bloomberg beyond legally required disclaimers, are set to run through the end of the primary season, even if Bloomberg does not win the nomination.\n\nIn his tweet, Bloomberg also linked to a Mediaite story on a new TV commercial by Bloomberg that refers to an alleged incident in which President Trump verbally attacked military leaders in a Pentagon briefing. The narrator in the ad calls Trump \"an erratic and out of control president.\"\n\nBloomberg initially flirted with a White House run early last year but decided against it in March, feeling he and former Vice President Joe Biden would split the center-left Democratic vote. However, in late November, with Biden battling other top-tier contenders, Bloomberg entered the race, citing concerns that none of the current candidates could defeat Trump in the 2020 election. He has already spent a quarter-billion dollars on ads for his White House bid.",
    " Title: President Obama Vows to Move Forward with Executive Order on Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has vowed to move forward with an executive order to ease immigration laws before the end of the year, disregarding warnings from Republican leaders that the move will strain his relationship with the incoming Republican-led Congress. The president stated that he would grant legal status to most of the estimated 11 million undocumented residents living in the U.S.\n\nIn an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Obama expressed his intention to address the country's immigration problems, stating, \"I'd prefer, and still prefer, to see it done through Congress. But every day that I wait, we're misallocating resources, we're deporting people that shouldn't be deported, we're not deporting folks that are dangerous and need to be deported.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, have warned Obama against unilateral action on immigration. Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, described the president's executive action on immigration as \"like tossing a hand grenade\" into his negotiations with the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nThe immigration reform debate adds to the challenges lawmakers will face when Congress resumes this week following a wave of Republican victories in the midterm elections. Lawmakers will also grapple with the budget, tax measures, and the confirmation of New York federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch as the next attorney general.\n\nObama acknowledged the Democrats' widespread losses in the elections, stating, \"We got beat.\" He added, \"The buck stops right here, at my desk.\" Despite a slow but steady economic recovery, Obama noted that many Americans are still struggling and are frustrated with partisan paralysis in Washington.\n\nIn the lame-duck session, lawmakers will also consider Obama's request of $5.6 billion to fight the Islamic State terrorist army, including $1.6 billion associated with a U.S. military buildup to train and equip Iraqi forces. Obama emphasized that U.S. troops would be training and supporting Iraqi and Sunni tribal forces, but would not be engaging in combat operations.\n\nAs he risks a confrontation with Republican leaders over immigration, Obama argued that offering legal status and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants was the only option because \"we don't have the capacity to deport 11 million people.\" Obama insisted that his executive order does not have to be the last word on immigration reform, stating that Congress still has an opportunity to pass legislation that could replace whatever executive action he takes.\n\nIn defending his decision to use an executive order, Obama also cited the need to secure the border, which has been a focus of Republicans in the immigration debate.

Wilson suggests that it is better for them to remain silent until they have a clear plan, rather than playing the story by what he terms as the \"Clinton Rules.\"\n\nWilson argues that the media has been eager to support Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, but the email scandal has brought to light the Clinton's \"slimy, predatory enterprise\" and its \"venal, sleazy, one-step-ahead-of-the-law hillbilly hustle.\" He suggests that the Clintons are stumbling towards political peril as the story unfolds, with potential legal and political implications for Clinton.\n\nWilson warns that the media is waiting for Republicans to make a mistake, and that an intemperate remark from a Republican could provide the perfect opportunity for the media to shift the focus away from the Clinton email scandal. He advises Republicans to maintain message discipline, focus on the broader implications of the email scandal, and avoid discussing social issues for a few days.\n\nWilson emphasizes the importance of having a plan, executing it with discipline, and proceeding against Clinton with a measured pace and tone. He suggests focusing on the national security risks posed by Clinton's email server, as well as the broader implications of the Clinton culture. Wilson encourages Republicans to use a bipartisan tone, reduce expectations, and vary their approach to avoid being demonized by the Clintons. He also advises Republicans to be persistent, serious, and smart in their approach.",
    " Title: Lockdown Leaves Many LGBTQ Indians Hidden and Vulnerable in Homes Amidst Family Discrimination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus lockdown in India has left many members of the LGBTQ community trapped with their families, leading to instances of physical assault, psychological torture, and widespread discrimination.\n\nKumar, a young gay man living in a town in northern India, was physically assaulted by his family after they discovered his secret. Shruta Neytra, co-founder of the LGBTQ online youth support group, Yaariyan, shared this information with the AFP news agency.\n\nKumar reached out to the group for help, but due to coronavirus restrictions on travel and movement, there was little anyone could do. Neytra stated, \"We are hearing of so many cases where people are facing harassment and psychological torture by their families.\"\n\nThe colonial-era law banning gay sex was abolished in 2018, and transgender Indians have been legally recognized as a third gender since 2014. However, outside the big cities, LGBTQ individuals still face widespread discrimination and violence.\n\nThe lockdown, which began in March, has brought misery to millions, destroying migrant workers' livelihoods and driving many deeper into poverty. The restrictions have also left LGBTQ Indians, who are already living on the margins, vulnerable to further abuse, often at the hands of their own families.\n\nFor transgender woman Anjali Siroya, going to work and seeing friends has always been a lifeline, taking her away from the hostile environment of the Mumbai tenement flat she shares with her parents and brother. \"They do not beat me anymore after I tried to run away once... but being with them 24/7 is still very traumatic,\" the 21-year-old told AFP.\n\nAs the pressure at home has grown, she has taken to Instagram to celebrate her gender identity with photographs of herself and vocal posts about the fight for equality. \"I miss dressing up, putting on lipstick and earrings, and posing for selfies,\" she said. \"I know this might sound silly to some people, but it was a way for me to express myself.\"\n\nAs LGBTQ Indians have increasingly turned to social media and online communities for support, many have also expressed a mounting urge to come out to their families. Seema, a bisexual sociology student in Delhi, told AFP that life under lockdown felt \"lonely and claustrophobic.\"\n\n\"Everything I say about girls needs to be said in code,\" she said, describing how she hides her phone from her mother and grandparents to avoid being accidentally outed. With no room of her own, she said in an emailed interview that she was even unable to speak privately on the phone, forcing her into a life of constant subterfuge.\n\n\"I feel compelled to come out on some days,\" she said as she spoke of not being able to share her dreams of love and marriage with her family. However, she feared that any such move would make her family monitor her movements and further limit her freedom.\n\n\"I just want to say 'My wife and I'... instead of hesitating and always being scared that it'll slip out by mistake,\" she added.\n\nLGBTQ activists have largely advised members of the community to do nothing until life returns to normal. Jo, digital editor for online forum Gaysi, who goes by one name, stated, \"As an out and proud trans person, I would never tell another person not to live their truth. But right now, it is simply too dangerous to come out of the closet.\"\n\nEven those who took the leap and found some acceptance say the aftermath has been complicated and stressful. \"I never expected to tell my father I am bisexual, it was nice seeing him react well to it,\" Tina, a 25-year-old artist, told AFP.\n\nHowever, as the lockdown wore on, subsequent interactions revealed that her father was \"not entirely comfortable,\" she said. \"Earlier, I didn't spend much time thinking about how my parents would respond; now every possibility has become more real,\" she said. \"I do not know how my mum will react if she knows. I do not think she will ask me to leave home, but I am not 100 percent sure.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Attributes Migrant Child Deaths at Border to Democratic Immigration Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has attributed the recent deaths of two migrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border to the immigration policies of congressional Democrats. In a series of tweets on Saturday, the President stated that the deaths were a result of liberal immigration policies that encourage foreign families to undertake the dangerous journey to the United States illegally.\n\nThe President tweeted, \"Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can\u2019t. If we had a Wall, they wouldn\u2019t even try!\"\n\nThis week, House Democrats ordered Homeland Security officials to preserve all evidence related to the two deaths this month of Guatemalan children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border with their parents. An 8-year-old boy, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, died on Christmas Eve after six days in Border Patrol custody. He had been treated for a cold and fever at a hospital and was released, but was readmitted hours later and died soon thereafter.\n\nHis mother in Guatemala stated that the boy's father brought the child on the trip to the U.S. in the belief that gaining illegal entry would be easier with a child. Earlier this month, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died after being arrested for crossing the border illegally with her father. Border Patrol agents twice managed to revive her after she fell ill, but she later suffered a heart attack and liver and respiratory failure at a hospital.\n\nPresident Trump stated that the two children \"were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol.\" The President also tweeted, \"The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn\u2019t given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!\"\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the deaths of these children are currently under investigation by House Democrats. It is unclear at this time what evidence they are seeking to preserve or the specifics of their investigation.",
    " Title: Christie and Clinton Share the Spotlight at Clinton Global Initiative Event\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, is headlining the closing ceremonies of Bill Clinton's annual international forum in Chicago. The event, titled \"Cooperation and Collaboration: A Conversation on Leadership,\" is a product of an unlikely partnership between Clinton and Christie that has developed over the past four years.\n\nIn 2009, Clinton campaigned against Christie during his re-election bid, but sources close to both men say they have since developed a friendship. The two have met, traded war stories, and spoken on the phone.\n\nClinton, a former president, and Christie, a first-term governor, share similar backgrounds, having both served as prosecutors. Clinton was the attorney general of Arkansas, while Christie served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\n\nThe unpredictable Christie was a key fundraiser and campaigner for Mitt Romney, Obama's GOP challenger in 2012. In return, Christie delivered the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa.\n\nFollowing Superstorm Sandy in 2012, Christie established a bipartisan working relationship with President Obama, which angered some GOP stalwarts. Now, as Christie faces re-election and is being touted as a possible contender for Clinton's old office on Pennsylvania Avenue, Christie is sharing the spotlight with him.\n\nRepresentatives of both men declined to comment for this story, saying Clinton and Christie will speak when they take the stage at today's Clinton Global Initiative event.\n\nInsiders say the friendship between Clinton and Christie started with Clinton taking note of Christie's political acumen even as he campaigned against Christie. Despite Clinton's speeches painting Christie as hostile toward women, the middle class, and working people, Clinton noticed Christie's tough talk and skill at sparring with reporters.\n\nIn 2010, when the two wound up a few rows apart at the Big East basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden, Clinton arranged for a quick chat with Christie. This led to a meeting at Clinton's post-presidential office in Harlem, where the two talked politics and public policy.\n\nFor a governor who constantly reminds people he can work with leaders of all stripes, the appearance today and the friendship with Clinton are worth the political risks.\n\n\"This is a stature thing,\" a Christie source said. \"It burnishes his [Christie's] bipartisan credentials and it shows the governor is a serious guy. He's talking about leadership with Clinton. That's a big deal.\"\n\nAs for Clinton's efforts to destroy Christie during the 2009 election, a Christie source said, \"The campaign's over.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Religious Freedom Cases Show Potential Shift in Interpretation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's defense of religious freedom may be experiencing a shift in interpretation, according to some legal experts. In a series of cases over the past year, the high court has prioritized preventing discrimination over protecting religion, from same-sex marriage to abortion and contraception.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, in an obscure order issued on the last day of the recent term, highlighted this trend. By refusing to consider a family-owned pharmacy's objection to a Washington state regulation forcing it to stock and sell emergency contraceptives, Alito warned that the court was sending an \"ominous sign.\"\n\nIn his statement, Alito expressed concern that if this trend continues, those who value religious freedom may have cause for great concern. The court's recent actions, he suggested, could affect an upcoming case involving a Missouri church's effort to qualify for state playground funds and potentially another challenge to the pharmacy rule.\n\nUnder the leadership of Chief Justices William Rehnquist and John Roberts, the court generally has carved out protections for religious groups and individuals. In recent years, it ruled in favor of a Muslim prisoner who sought to wear a beard, a Muslim woman denied a job because she wore a headscarf, and a tiny Arizona church that protested municipal restrictions on street signs.\n\nHowever, after ruling for the craft giant Hobby Lobby in the 2014 contraceptives case, the court did not side with religious non-profits or the government this year in similar cases, instead sending them back for further appellate review. It struck down Texas restrictions on abortion clinics and, on the final day of the term, refused to hear the pharmacy's petition.\n\nThe case was brought by the Stormans family, which operates Ralph's Thriftway in Olympia, Wash. The family had what conservatives considered a slam-dunk case against a unique state regulation that pharmacies must fill prescriptions for contraceptives, including morning-after pills that prevent a fertilized egg from reaching the uterus.\n\n\"Ralph\u2019s has made a strong case...that the regulations here are improperly designed to stamp out religious objectors,\" Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. In his final footnote, Alito invited another legal challenge.\n\nKristen Waggoner, who represented the pharmacy through a federal district court victory and an appeals court defeat, says it's too soon to assume the court has shifted on religious freedom cases. However, she notes the refusal to hear the Stormans case \"does cause you to wonder.\"\n\n\"We're seeing the red flags,\" Waggoner says. \"The risk is Americans will no longer have the right to live consistent with their faith without punishment from the government.\"\n\nSome defenders of religious freedom do not share Alito's fear for the future. Eric Rassbach, deputy general counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, says the court has been responsive to religious liberty claims in most of the cases in recent years. \"I don\u2019t see a reason to think that the court is going to become deaf to religious claims,\" Rassbach says.\n\nDouglas Laycock, a religious liberty expert at the University of Virginia School of Law, agrees that the risk arises when core issues important to liberals are at stake, such as women's access to all methods of birth control. \"The liberal justices are willing to protect religious liberty when their more favored issues are not at stake, or perhaps when the case is clear enough,\" Laycock says.\n\nHowever, when other interests such as preventing discrimination against women, gays and lesbians, or minorities are involved, the court's latest responses please liberal groups. \"Religious liberty doesn\u2019t give you a right to impose your views on others,\" Louise Melling, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, says. She sees the court's recent actions as \"part of a broader move to advance equality.\"\n\nMany conservatives are wary that the court\u2014stripped of Scalia's influence and vote, and often controlled by the more mercurial Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2014increasingly may favor government regulators over religious believers. \"What we\u2019re seeing is a sort of shift around social norms concerning sexuality,\" says Jay Richards, assistant research professor at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. \"Kennedy is the best Geiger counter. He\u2019s a very good instrument for measuring that.\"\n\nThe next test will come in the fall, when the justices consider a Missouri church's challenge to being denied state funds for playground resurfacing. A second case involving the pharmacy regulations also could be headed their way in the future, along with lawsuits from merchants who refuse to participate in same-sex weddings. \"There's more and more of these cases coming up,\" Waggoner says. \"This is not over.\"",
    " Title: Russia Imposes Import Ban on Food Products from Western Countries in Response to Sanctions\n\nArticle:\n\nRussia has announced a one-year ban on imports of meat, fish, milk and milk products, fruit and vegetables from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada, and Norway. The decision, announced by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, was made in response to sanctions imposed by the West over the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nThe ban includes potential restrictions on Western carriers flying over Russia on flights to and from Asia, as well as possible restrictions on imports of planes, navy vessels, and cars. However, Medvedev stated that the government will realistically assess its own production potential before making a decision.\n\nThe latest round of sanctions against Russia, imposed by the EU last week, targeted entire sectors of the Russian economy for the first time. The U.S. and the EU have accused Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March, of fomenting tensions in eastern Ukraine by supplying arms and expertise to a pro-Moscow insurgency. As a result, asset freezes and loan bans have been imposed on a number of individuals and companies.\n\nMedvedev argued that the ban would benefit Russian farmers, who have struggled to compete with Western products. However, experts have expressed doubts about the ability of local producers to fill the gap left by the ban, as Russia's agricultural sector continues to suffer from poor efficiency and a lack of funds.\n\nAnalysts predict that the ban will further speed up inflation, particularly in the largest and most prosperous cities such as Moscow, where imported food fills an estimated 60-70 percent of the market. In 2013, the EU's agricultural exports to Russia totaled 11.8 billion euros ($15.8 billion), while food and agricultural imports from the U.S. amounted to $1.3 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nMedvedev expressed hope that the sanctions would make the West revise its policy and stop trying to pressure Russia with sanctions. \"Until the last moment we hoped that our partners would understand that sanctions only lead to a deadlock, and no one needs them,\" he said. \"We hope our partners will put a pragmatic economic approach above bad policy considerations, and they will start thinking instead of trying to scare us.\"",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Address to Congress: A Critique of Republican Policies and Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis' address to the United States Congress on Thursday, September 24, 2015, was a critique of several Republican policies and an implicit rebuke to the do-nothing, obstructionist GOP agenda. The speech, which was not overtly political, highlighted five key moments that made conservatives uncomfortable.\n\n1. Dorothy Day Shout-out: Francis commended four Americans in particular, whom he held up as examples of pursuing the common good: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Trappist monk Thomas Merton, and Dorothy Day. Day, a radical social activist, is noted for founding the Catholic Worker Movement during the Great Depression and urging Catholics to form small, autonomous communities to lead simple lives devoted to the gospel and serving the poor.\n\n2. Abortion Switcheroo: In defiance of the specific guidance not to score political points, congressional conservatives leapt to their feet when Francis delivered the Vatican's standard coded language about abortion. However, they were taken aback when he immediately followed that with a call for the global abolition of the death penalty.\n\n3. Arms Deals: Speaking of death, what about all those arms deals the Republicans are so fond of? Francis questioned who is selling the bad guys all these weapons and why, stating that \"money... is drenched in blood.\"\n\n4. Reminding the GOP We're All Foreigners: As in his speech at the White House on Tuesday, Francis felt the need to remind those who are making intolerance toward immigrants their political stock-in-trade that they, like him, are likely the descendants of immigrant families.\n\n5. Confronting the Climate Naysayers: Francis made it clear that combating climate change, development, and technology can coexist. He explicitly rebuked many conservative critics of his climate change encyclical \"Laudato si,\" who claim that he is anti-commerce and wants to stifle development or reduce the world to subsistence-level farming to stop climate change.\n\nIn one of the most moving passages of his speech, Francis said, \"Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves.\"\n\nPatricia Miller, author of \"Good Catholics: The Battle Over Abortion in the Catholic Church,\" commented on the speech, stating that Francis' voice of faith was likely a point of contention for conservatives.",
    " Title: El Chapo Escapes Mexican Prison Through Tunnel\n\n Article:\n\n Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Mexico's most notorious drug kingpin, has escaped from prison through a mile-long tunnel, authorities confirmed. The closed-circuit video footage shows Guzman calmly and easily evading surveillance cameras and leaving his monitoring bracelet behind before his escape.\n\n According to Mexican Interior Minister Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong, Guzman's cell was under 24-hour surveillance, but the system had two blind spots for privacy: the toilet and the shower. Guzman reportedly used the shower's blind spot to slip through a hole under the shower and escape.\n\n The United States and Mexico are exchanging intelligence and providing technical support in the manhunt for Guzman. Reports claiming authorities from the two countries are not working together are false, according to Deputy DEA Administrator Jack Riley.\n\n Guzman, also known as \"Shorty,\" has a history of elaborate escapes. In 2001, he managed to break free while hiding in a laundry cart. It took authorities 13 years to catch him. The Sinaloa cartel, which Guzman heads, moves drugs by land, air, and sea, including cargo aircraft, private aircraft, buses, fishing vessels, and even submarines.\n\n The cartel has become so powerful that Forbes magazine listed Guzman in its 2009 list of \"self-made\" billionaires. Guzman's estimated fortune at the time was $1 billion. Chicago has labeled him \"Public Enemy No. 1.\"\n\n The Sinaloa cartel's influence extends globally, supplying much of the marijuana, cocaine, and heroin sold on the streets of the United States. It is likely that prison workers helped Guzman break out, and it is believed that the cartel had spent years infiltrating Mexico's prison system to plan the escape.\n\n Mexican authorities have released a recent photograph of Guzman, showing him with a shaved head and face, but without his trademark mustache. The tunnel began with a 50-by-50-centimeter (20-by-20-inch) opening inside the shower of Guzman's cell and ended inside a half-built house. The tunnel was complete with lighting, ventilation, and a modified motorcycle on tracks.",
    " Title: Senator Ted Cruz Introduces Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a Republican presidential candidate, has introduced the Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act of 2015. The bill aims to temporarily bar refugees from countries with significant terrorist presence, including Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nThe bill, which is constitutionally sound and common-sense, is a response to the ongoing threat of radical Islamic terrorism and the infiltration of terrorists among the flood of refugees entering Europe and the United States. The bill specifically names these five countries as sources of potential terror and empowers the State Department to identify and designate additional countries as potential sources of terror.\n\nThe bill is temporary, sunsetting after three years, and allows for Congress to reevaluate the global situation and make necessary adjustments or let the law expire. It also allows a narrow exception to the refugee ban in cases of genocide victims, such as the Yazidis and certain Christian sects, including Assyrians. This exception would only be available for the severest cases of persecution and would require a high bar of proof.\n\nSenator Cruz emphasized that the bill is a small, first step toward protecting America from the threat of terrorist infiltration. He stated, \"The fact of the matter is that no Christian or Yazidi has systematically executed concert-goers while shouting 'Allahu Akbar.' Pretending all the refugees are equally likely or unlikely to commit terrorist acts prevents us from helping those we can while protecting ourselves from a real threat.\"\n\nThe bill is a response to the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, which were claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Cruz stated, \"This is a small, first step toward protecting America, and I will never apologize for defending this nation.\"",
    " Title: Protestors in Kentucky Hang Effigy of Governor Andy Beshear Outside State Capitol\n\nArticle:\n\nProtestors in Kentucky, organized by Take Back Kentucky, hung an effigy of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration on Sunday. The protest was intended to \"celebrate freedom and to fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown over the coronavirus,\" according to a Facebook post.\n\nThe around-100 people present began by celebrating the Second Amendment, but the rally eventually turned into a call against coronavirus restrictions. Protestors marched to the governor's house shouting \"Come out Andy,\" according to videos posted on Twitter. They later returned to the state capitol, where \"several people\" participated in hanging the effigy from a tree, the Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd reported.\n\nThe effigy had a picture of Beshear's face on it and a message that read \"sic temper tyrannis,\" a Latin phrase that translates to \"thus always to tyrants.\" The effigy was taken down shortly afterwards, according to the Courier Journal.\n\nThe protestor's actions caused swift backlash from members of both parties. Senate Majority Leader and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell condemned the effigy in a statement posted on Twitter Sunday evening. McConnell, a strong defender of the First Amendment, believed Americans have the right to peacefully protest, but the actions demonstrated at the protest went too far.\n\nRepublican Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Kentucky Michael G. Adams also tweeted, \"This is disgusting and I condemn it wholeheartedly. The words of John Wilkes Booth have no place in the Party of Lincoln.\"\n\nMany others condemned the effigy hanging, the Courier Journal reported. Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted, \"On Memorial Day weekend, as we honor those who gave their lives for our country, & think of the small sacrifices we make to protect our community from a pandemic, we must condemn this vile act. When we share science, keep each other healthy & safe, freedom will follow.\"\n\nKentucky House Democrats also issued a lengthy statement against the effigy, calling it \"beyond reprehensible.\"",

Concha argued that the campaign wants to avoid the \"extemporaneous Joe Biden\" due to his tendency to make statements that may be perceived as problematic or out of touch.\n\nBiden currently leads President Donald Trump in the race for the White House, as majorities express concerns about racism, unemployment, and the coronavirus's impact on the country's stability, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

    " Title: Facebook Takes Steps to Combat Deepfakes Ahead of Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook is taking steps to combat deepfakes, manipulated videos created using artificial intelligence (AI) to deceive users. The social media giant is banning videos that are \"edited or synthesized\" to mislead users but will allow parody and satire. The move comes as concerns grow that deepfakes could be used to mislead voters, similar to the way fabricated news stories influenced public opinion in 2016.\n\nDeepfakes are videos doctored using cutting-edge AI technology to distort reality. The technology, which analyzes real images to generate fake ones, is a growing form of disinformation, and social media platforms have been struggling with how to deal with it. Facebook and other tech companies are sponsoring a \"Deepfake Detection Challenge\" to encourage AI researchers to develop new ways to automatically detect doctored videos.\n\nThe dangers of manipulated recordings\nThe ability to create fake videos or manipulate existing videos has been around for decades, but typically required some software or skill. In recent years, tools have become popular on social media and elsewhere that allow anyone to manipulate images and video, though this footage usually appears obviously manipulated. Today, powerful new technologies are making it cheaper, faster, and easier to produce deepfakes that are \"nearly indistinguishable from reality,\" says Hao Li, associate professor of computer science at the University of Southern California.\n\nThere are also simpler but still effective ways to deceive social media users called \"cheap fakes,\" which typically involve editing videos to spread disinformation or propaganda. Digitally manipulated video is dangerous because we tend to have faith in what we see, Li says. \"It's a real problem, and it's something that is advancing really quickly,\" he says. \"Regulators and lawmakers are not catching up with this kind of technology.\"\n\nFacebook's new deepfake policy is too narrow, says Hany Farid, a computer science professor at University of California, Berkeley, specializing in digital forensics. Under the policy, Facebook would not prohibit videos using lower-tech methods of spreading disinformation, such as last year's video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which was edited to make it seem as though she was slurring her speech.\n\nRachel Thomas, director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at University of San Francisco, expects \"cheap fakes\" and the more sophisticated deepfakes to proliferate ahead of the presidential election as part of shadowy campaigns to sway public opinion. Imagining a fake Donald Trump or a fake Joe Biden simulated saying a racial slur, then imagining how quickly those videos would spread on Facebook or YouTube, Thomas says, \"The stakes are very high. This kind of misinformation can have a big impact.\"\n\nWhen used to target elected officials or political candidates, doctored video can erode trust. Nearly two-thirds of Americans recently surveyed by Pew Research said altered images and videos caused a great deal of confusion in understanding the basic facts of current events.\n\nHow can you tell if the video you're watching is a deepfake?\n\"That is becoming increasingly difficult. The technology behind fake videos is improving almost on a continuous basis,\" says Siwei Lyu, computer science professor at the State University of New York at Albany and a member of the Deepfake Detection Challenge's advisory group. He recommends \"psychological preparedness,\" as in being constantly on the alert for videos, images, and audio that have been altered.\n\n\"Whenever you see an interesting video showing something that is bizarre or exceptional, a certain vigilance should be raised,\" he says. Examine the video carefully before sharing it on social media. Is the video low-resolution or grainy? Is it a single person talking in the video? Is it relatively short, say 30 seconds or 60 seconds long?\n\nIs the lighting strange or the face discolored or blurry? Is there blurriness between the face and neck or between the face and the hair? Is the sound not synced with the images? Some of the other tell-tale signs discernible to the naked eye, according to Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University, include different-sized eyes or ill-formed teeth, or more than two eyes, or inconsistencies in the background of the video.\n\nBut, says Kambhampati, the rapid improvements in deepfake technology means that we will soon have to rely on AI techniques to detect what the human eye can't. \"There is not a 100% foolproof way of identifying deepfakes, not even for AI researchers,\" Thomas says. \"Detection is always going to be an arms race. As people develop more accurate detection algorithms, fakers will develop even more sophisticated frauds.\"\n\nThere are non-technical ways to sniff out a deepfake, just like other forms of disinformation. Ask yourself: Who is the person publishing this information? Is this person reliable? What else has this person posted? Are the claims in the post backed up by sources you trust? When in doubt, turn to nonpartisan fact-checkers who've spent hours, sometimes days, tracking down accurate information, Farid says.\n\n\"You never want to jump to a conclusion one way or another, you never want to say: I looked at this and I'm sure it's real or I looked at this and I'm sure it's fake,\" he says. \"The best you can really hope to do is to say: You know what? I should be careful here because I'm not sure, and then research it.\"\n\nLi says his company, Pinscreen, will demonstrate for attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos how to livestream fake video. He says it's part of an effort to raise awareness of the need for technologies that root out deepfakes. \"In real-time, you can reenact yourself as Will Smith or some celebrity or a politician. You can be George Bush,\" he says. \"The results are very convincing.\"",

The speech, which announced an increase in troops for the 16-year-long war, was seen as a return to the \"same old fare\" that Americans had rejected in November.\n\nConservative commentator Ann Coulter, who had been an enthusiastic supporter of Trump during the campaign, expressed her disappointment in a tweet, stating, \"It doesn't matter who you vote for. The military-industrial complex wins. The only difference: GOP presidents pronounce 'Pakistan' correctly.\"\n\nFox News Radio's Todd Starnes accused the president of changing his campaign promise from \"America First\" to \"Afghanistan First.\" Other right-wingers also reacted negatively to the speech, noting the contrast between Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail and the new plan.\n\nRadio host Stefan Molyneux contrasted Trump's speech with statements he had made on Twitter on Afghanistan before. Filmmaker and author Mike Cernovich sarcastically offered his congratulations to \"President McMaster\" and \"General Jared,\" referring to Trump's national security adviser and senior adviser respectively.\n\nEven moderate conservatives struggled to drum up enthusiasm for Trump's policy. Right-leaning Washington Post reporter Robert Costa gave a lukewarm reception to the plan, tweeting, \"This is a speech wrapped in layers of non-interventionist rhetoric, sprinkled with Queens and 'Patton'-type bravado, delivered gently.\" Costa noted the contrast between some of the rhetoric from Trump and the plan itself, tweeting, \"Trump is echoing many of the points Bannon made behind the scenes.

While Trump's stance on immigration was never extensively detailed beyond calls for a border wall and a tough enforcement policy, his recent statements have further obscured his position, which he is set to address in a major speech in Arizona on Wednesday.\n\nA year ago, Trump's stated position on deportations involved the removal of all undocumented immigrants and their family members, including U.S. citizens by birth. This hardline stance, which was popular among Republican primary voters, has been softened in the general election context, with Trump expressing openness to a \"touch back\" policy, where undocumented immigrants who are deported can re-enter and be put on a path to legalization. However, his campaign manager has ruled out this option.\n\nOn birthright citizenship, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence stated on CNN that the issue is a subject for the future. Trump himself has also expressed contradictory views on softening his stance on immigration, only to reverse himself a few days later and suggest a hardening of his position.\n\nPolicy experts have expressed a desire for clarity on Trump's immigration policies, with Jacinta Ma of the National Immigration Forum Action Fund stating, \"We would really like [Trump] to be more clear about the immigration policies that he\u2019s talking about.\" Ma added, \"The expectation should be that, as president, he should be able to articulate the policies in a clear manner so that we understand what... he wants to do in terms of the direction of the country as it relates to immigration policy.\"\n\nExperts are skeptical that Trump can provide such clarity, given his past statements and positions on immigration. Ben Johnson of the American Immigration Lawyers Association stated, \"A lot of what [Trump] is saying is either completely wrong or completely contradictory. I don\u2019t see a way out for him on this issue unless he makes a really significant, clear change in [his] policy position because so much of the language he\u2019s been using so far has just been unworkable and broadly opposed by the majority of the American people.\"\n\nTrump's supporters may offer some wiggle room for his immigration stance, as they seem to prioritize the construction of a border wall above other immigration policies. However, with Trump having run for 14 months as an anti-immigrant, \"law and order\" candidate, any moderation of his views may not be enough to sway voters at this point in the campaign.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Threatens to Ignore Senate Bills in Response to Filibuster Rule Change Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, joined Senate Republicans in their ongoing battle to prevent Democrats from limiting filibusters on Thursday. Boehner's threat signifies an escalation of the partisan fight that has been brewing in the Senate for weeks.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, has indicated that he may use a simple majority vote to alter filibuster rules when the new Congress convenes in January. This move, which usually requires a two-thirds vote to change Senate rules, would allow Democrats to amend filibuster rules without GOP support, a prospect that has angered Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, and other Republicans.\n\nWith Democrats set to control the White House and Senate, while Republicans will lead only the House, the Republican party is reportedly making efforts to retain as much power as possible. The Democrats will control the new Senate 55-45, including one Democratic-leaning independent.\n\nBoehner criticized Reid's plan, stating, \"The threat [Reid's plan] is clearly designed to marginalize Senate Republicans and their constituents while greasing the skids for controversial, partisan measures.\" He added, \"Any bill that reaches a Republican-led House based on Senate Democrats' heavy-handed power play would be dead on arrival.\"\n\nThe rules change would not take effect until the new Congress begins in January, but Boehner suggested that it could poison the atmosphere even sooner, \"at a time when cooperation on Capitol Hill is critical.\"\n\nCurrently, congressional leaders are negotiating deficit-cutting measures to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff of big tax increases and deep spending cuts scheduled to begin in January unless lawmakers find a way to avert them.\n\nMinority parties in the Senate use filibusters, parliamentary delays, to slow or kill legislation. These can only be ended by 60 votes, a margin neither party can achieve without some cooperation from the other side. Democrats argue that Republicans are abusing filibusters by resorting to them too frequently, while Republicans claim they are blocked from presenting amendments by Democrats.\n\nReid's plan would forbid the use of filibusters when a bill is initially being brought to the Senate floor for debate and require filibustering senators to be physically present on the Senate floor, a practice that has been long-abandoned.\n\nIn response to Boehner's threat, Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, stated, \"It is a shame to see Speaker Boehner join Sen. McConnell's desperate attempt to double down in the status quo of Republican-led gridlock in Washington.\"\n\nThe battle has prompted numerous sharp exchanges on the Senate floor in recent days between Reid and McConnell. Neither side has ruled out negotiating a solution to the dispute.",
    " Title: Trump's Election Victory and the Pursuit of Obamacare Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential election results have shown a significant shift in the political landscape, with Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. Despite many commentators, including some who predicted Trump's win, underestimating his electoral prospects, the outcome has paved the way for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nAccording to the first major post-election voter survey, 74% of Republicans expressed a desire to repeal the Affordable Care Act when Donald Trump takes office. This sentiment is not limited to the Republican party, as a majority of Americans also want to be rid of the law. In late October, Gallup reported that 51% of Americans favored repealing Obamacare. A week before the election, Rasmussen reported that a majority of voters wanted changes in Obamacare, with more calling for its outright repeal.\n\nThe media's response to the repeal of Obamacare has been met with a wave of skepticism and resistance. The Washington Post warns that Donald Trump will face a \"rude awakening\" over Obamacare, while the Los Angeles Times declares that \"repealing Obamacare will be almost impossible.\" Politico has even gone so far as to claim that \"Obamacare defenders vow 'total war.'\"\n\nHowever, the media's pessimism may be misplaced. The GOP will have control of both the presidency and Congress, and they have shown in the past that they can repeal parts of Obamacare without a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. In 2015, the GOP used the budget maneuver, reconciliation, to pass H.R.3762, a bill that would have eliminated the individual and employer mandates, many of its taxes, and phased out its subsidies. Although President Obama vetoed the bill, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that the GOP had shown a \"clear path to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the Senate.\"\n\nIn 2018, at least 6 of the 48 Democrat Senators who will retain their seats after January must face reelection in red states where the voters will not reward them for obstructing repeal. These vulnerable Democrats may well be willing to cooperate with the Republicans in breaking a filibuster.\n\nEven if these red state Democrats remain intransigent, the worst elements of Obamacare can still be repealed by sidestepping a filibuster. The GOP leadership can utilize the same budget maneuver, reconciliation, to repeal parts of the law.\n\nConspicuously absent from the discussion is any discussion of which provisions of the President's \"signature domestic achievement\" are supported by the 60.3 million voters who cast their ballots for Trump, the majority of people living in the red states that cover most of the electoral map. The answer to that question, oddly enough, appears to be of little interest to the media, the anti-Trump rioters, or the thumb-suckers of the Snowflake Rebellion. Nonetheless, last Tuesday's exit polls have a story to tell about Obamacare for anyone willing to listen: \"Voters feeling that the law went too far are breaking decisively for Trump, 80% to 13%.\" In flyover country, we call this a mandate.",
    " Title: Divergent Approaches: Obama and GOP Focus on Minimum Wage and Obamacare, Respectively\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a clear demonstration of contrasting priorities, the White House and congressional Republicans have taken different approaches in the ongoing election year. The Obama administration has shifted its focus towards economic and income-equality issues, while the GOP remains centered on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and its impact across the nation.\n\nIn his weekly address, President Obama reiterated his call for a minimum wage increase from the current $7.25 to $10.10 for all Americans. He highlighted his recent executive action to implement a pay raise for federal contractors as part of his \"opportunity agenda.\"\n\nHowever, in this week's GOP address, Representative Tom Rooney of Florida did not mention the president's minimum wage push or related issues. Instead, he focused solely on Obamacare.\n\nThe minimum wage increase for all Americans is a significant component of President Obama's \"opportunity agenda,\" and unlike other parts of this agenda, it requires congressional approval. In his address, President Obama stated, \"Raising the minimum wage wouldn't just raise their wages\u2014its effect would lift wages for about 28 million Americans. It would lift millions of Americans out of poverty and help millions more work their way out of poverty without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, are relying on the continued emergence of Obamacare-related issues between now and November, hoping to increase their majority in the House and potentially capture the Senate. Representative Rooney highlighted instances of constituents losing access to their primary care physicians and specialists due to changes in their health plans.\n\nIn his address, Rooney stated, \"This goes well beyond a glitch or a pocketbook issue. This is a breach of faith. The president's promises have proven false for working families, and now they are proving false for our seniors as well.\" He also called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, despite previous attempts to do so having failed more than 40 times in the past.\n\nThe president and fellow Democrats aim to make the minimum wage and the broader issue of income inequality a top concern leading into the fall elections. Republicans, conversely, are banking on the persistence of Obamacare-related issues to bolster their position in the upcoming elections.",
    " Title: Senate Faces Constitutional Obligation as Obama's Nominees Face Obstruction from Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is facing a significant constitutional obligation as President Barack Obama's nominees for key positions, including the Secretary of Labor, Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, and the National Labor Relations Board, face obstruction from Republican senators. The Senate's approval or rejection of these nominations could potentially impact the functioning of these agencies and the broader democratic process.\n\nThe Senate is expected to deliberate on these nominations in July. If the Republicans continue to block \"yes\" or \"no\" votes on Obama's executive and judicial nominees, the majority may be forced to revisit Senate rules to put an end to the Republican efforts to subvert the Senate's constitutional duty to provide advice and consent.\n\nThe nominee for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Richard Cordray, is a notable example of this obstruction. The CFPB was established as part of the Wall Street reform law to protect consumers of financial products. Despite the CFPB's purpose to safeguard consumers from financial products like mortgages to credit cards, Republicans have refused to confirm Cordray. In fact, Republicans have stated they will not confirm anyone to run the CFPB, aiming to render the agency ineffective as intended by law.\n\nThe Republican obstinacy is equally apparent in the president's nominees for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent agency responsible for protecting workers' rights. A hearing on these nominees this month showed no signs of a thaw in the Republican resistance. As a result, Cordray and some current NLRB members had to be appointed through recess appointments.\n\nA recent decision by three Republican-appointed judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has further complicated the situation. This decision, which goes against decades of precedent, argues that the president does not have the power to make recess appointments. This decision is part of a pattern in which the D.C. Circuit has blocked Wall Street reforms, undermined labor rights, and rolled back environmental protections.\n\nInitially, there were four vacancies on the 11-member court. Although Republicans allowed one of these vacancies to be filled last month, they are attempting to prevent the president from filling the remaining three and restoring balance to the D.C. Circuit. Republicans are aware that when senior judges, who handle a reduced caseload, are counted, this court still is dominated by Republican appointees. In a desperate effort to maintain this dominance, the latest underhanded tactic from Republican senators amounts to a 'pre-emptive filibuster'\u2014an attempt to eliminate the three remaining vacant judgeships on the court to prevent Obama from exercising his constitutional obligation.",
    " Title: Trump Transition Team Accelerates Activity, Deploys \"Landing Parties\" to Federal Agencies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has stepped up its efforts this week, deploying \"landing parties\" to federal agencies responsible for national security and reportedly offering the first major appointment of the new administration. On Thursday, visits to the National Security Council, Departments of Defense, Justice, and State were made to lay the groundwork for the handover in January.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, citing an anonymous senior Trump official, Trump has offered the post of White House national security adviser to retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency chief. The status of Gen. Flynn's acceptance of the offer was unclear as of Thursday evening.\n\nTrump held numerous interviews at Trump Tower in New York with potential Cabinet members and advisers, and met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with leaders of both parties on Capitol Hill.\n\nFollowing a \"very candid\" meeting with Abe, the Japanese Prime Minister expressed confidence in Trump, stating, \"I will be able to establish a relationship of trust.\" Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump face-to-face since his election victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nMeanwhile, the landing-party members huddled in conference rooms at the agencies, receiving thick binders and detailed presentations that included organization charts, budget forecasts, and parking space assignments, according to veterans of previous transitions.\n\nDouglas Brook, who worked on outgoing transition teams for Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, noted that both sides typically are professionals who \"speak the same language\" in their fields of expertise, regardless of policy differences. However, he emphasized that a concerted effort is required to achieve a smooth handover, as accomplished by the Bush-Obama teams.\n\nThe transition team's timetable has been emphasized due to repeated news reports about slow progress and turmoil, which Trump transition officials dispute. Trump's pace in filling his Cabinet is not off the pace of most recent presidents, as when Barack Obama was putting together his first administration in 2008, he did not make his first Cabinet appointment until three weeks after the election.\n\nTrump's landing parties will tackle federal agencies in three waves: national security, economic, and domestic. The next wave will reportedly involve the Treasury, Commerce Department, U.S. Trade Representative's office, Small Business Administration, and Social Security Administration. The final team will focus on domestic agencies, including the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, Homeland Security, Energy, Labor, Transportation, Education, and Health and Human Services, as well as independent agencies such as the Office of Management and Budget, Federal Trade Commission, and NASA.\n\nTrump's meeting schedule in New York on Thursday included diplomatic legend Henry Kissinger, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, and Family Research Council leader Ken Blackwell. The most unexpected meeting was reportedly set for this weekend with Mitt Romney, the 2012 presidential nominee who was the party's most outspoken critic of Trump during the race.\n\nTrump's transition meetings will move to the private Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday, and the Trump-Romney meeting is expected to take place there due to Trump's plans to stay in Bedminster until Sunday night.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a transition team member who is a potential pick for U.S. attorney general, expressed support for Trump meeting with people like Romney, stating, \"There are a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with, and I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things.\"\n\nRomney is reportedly under consideration for secretary of state, although this could not be confirmed. Other possible candidates to lead the State Department include Nikki Haley, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John R. Bolton.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner's Lawsuit Against President Obama: A Boon for the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, House Speaker John Boehner's lawsuit against President Barack Obama over the use of unilateral executive authority has been met with a welcoming response from the White House. The lawsuit, which some view as a bold move by the Republican party, has been embraced by the White House as an opportunity to highlight the President's executive actions and address a long-standing political challenge.\n\nSince the Republican party took control of the House in 2010, President Obama has faced a fundamental political challenge in terms of public understanding of the U.S. constitutional order. The average American voter expects the government to improve their lives, and when this doesn't happen, they often grow frustrated with the President. When the President's agenda is stymied in Congress, the public is not interested in discussions about filibusters or the Speaker's ability to keep bills from reaching the floor. Instead, they question why the President is not leading and getting things done.\n\nTo address this issue, President Obama has not only relied on unilateral executive action to advance his policy aims but has also worked to highlight these actions. These actions, often small-bore in nature, have been difficult to attract substantial public attention due to their relatively minor impact.\n\nThe specter of a U.S. Congress engaging in a high-profile political fight over the idea that the President has been doing too much is, therefore, a valuable opportunity for the White House. The lawsuit allows the President to refute the argument that he is not leading, demonstrating that he is indeed taking action, albeit within the bounds of his executive authority.\n\nIn a statement to reporters, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest criticized Republican leaders in Congress for playing \"Washington politics\" rather than working with the President on behalf of hardworking Americans. The implication is that, were it not for the lawsuit, Republicans would be engaged in constructive compromises with the White House. However, the real-world alternative to litigation is simply doing nothing\u2014the parties do not agree, and nothing Obama or Boehner does or says is likely to change that.\n\nThe current partisan debate is often described as a stalemate, but it may be more accurately captured by the chess term \"Zugzwang,\" a situation in which the optimal move would be to pass and force the other player to make a move\u2014except that passing is against the rules of chess. The best strategy for House Republicans this summer and fall might be to do nothing, given the President's low approval rating, the GOP's expected midterm gains, and the need to avoid rocking the boat.\n\nHowever, conservative activists are unlikely to tolerate a passive strategy. They are critical of Obama and want Speaker Boehner to take action that expresses this criticism. Lawsuits are a less extreme move than impeachment, so given the realities of the situation, the litigation may be a shrewd move by Boehner rather than a blunder. Yet, the impatience of the activist right remains a gift to the White House, allowing the President to underscore the basic reality of the situation\u2014there are things he would like to do that Republicans are fiercely opposing.",
    " Title: Trump Cancels Peace Talks with Taliban Following Deadly Kabul Bombing\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Monday that peace negotiations with the Taliban are off following a bombing in Afghanistan that resulted in the death of an American service member. The bombing, claimed by the Taliban, occurred in Kabul on August 15, 2019.\n\nThe planned meeting between Taliban leaders and representatives of the Afghan government, which was set to take place at Camp David on Sunday, was called off by President Trump in response to the Kabul bombing that resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier and 12 other individuals. Critics had previously criticized the planned meeting, scheduled just days before the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as disrespectful.\n\nPresident Trump stated that the decision to cancel the meeting was his own, and he did not consult with any other individuals. \"It was my idea,\" Trump told reporters. \"I didn't discuss it with anybody else. When I heard... that they killed one of our soldiers and 12 other innocent people, there's no way I'm meeting.\"\n\nThe president also disputed reports that he had overruled advisers, including National Security Advisor John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence, to schedule the meeting in the first place.\n\nIn a tweet on September 9, 2019, Trump wrote, \"A lot of Fake News is being reported that I overruled the VP and various advisers on a potential Camp David meeting with the Taliban. This Story is False! I always think it is good to meet and talk, but in this case I decided not to.\"\n\nPresident Trump also criticized the prolonged U.S. presence in Afghanistan, recalling his promise to bring home the approximately 14,000 American troops currently stationed in the war-torn country. In a separate tweet on September 9, 2019, Trump stated, \"We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth. Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo also commented on the canceled meeting, stating on Sunday, \"We're going to walk away from a deal if others try to use violence to achieve better ends in the negotiations. It's not right. It's not appropriate. It killed an American. And it made no sense for the Taliban to be rewarded for that kind of bad behavior.\"",
    " Title: Media's Role in Political Violence: A Neutral Analysis of Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the increasing political violence in the United States and the role of the media in shaping public discourse. The author suggests that the emergence of the \"angry left\" and the Occupy movement, as well as the alt-right, neo-Nazis, and the Klan, have led to an escalation of violent incidents.\n\nThe author notes that the media has played a significant role in this escalation, with the media's attention and approval, either overt or subtle, being seen as a form of endorsement for these groups. The author cites examples such as the assassination attempt on Congressman Steve Scalise and the violence at Charlottesville, Virginia, as instances where the media's attention has contributed to the groups' visibility.\n\nThe author also points out that the left and right have their own violent practitioners, with the left-wing practitioners being described as \"pretty much marginal\" and the right-wing practitioners being kept in the news due to their criminality. The author notes that the left has escalated things by threatening the right's advertisers, with the more timorous corporate titans bowing to the left's threats, only to return when they found the left's threats to be mostly hollow.\n\nThe author also mentions the support that conservative media figures like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham have received from media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who is praised for breaking the left's monopoly on media with his Fox News channel. The author suggests that the left's threats to advertisers are a continuation of their attempts to influence media content, citing the left's successful attempts to drop conservative columnists from newspapers in the past.\n\nThe author concludes by suggesting that the media's role in shaping public discourse and its influence on political violence is a complex issue, with the media's attention and approval being seen as a form of endorsement for certain groups, and the media's neglect being seen as a form of marginalization for others. The author also suggests that the media's role in shaping public discourse is a matter of concern, with the growing acrimony on newspaper pages being a potential cause for concern.",
    " Title: Tillerson Urges International Community to Implement and Strengthen UN Sanctions Against North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson addressed the United Nations Security Council on Friday, urging member countries to financially cut ties with North Korea and freeze access to funds that could be used for nuclear weapons development. Tillerson called for the full implementation of U.N. sanctions and the suspension or downgrading of diplomatic ties with North Korea.\n\nTillerson stated, \"With each successive detonation and missile test, North Korea pushes northeast Asia and the world closer to instability and broader conflict.\" He emphasized the real threat of a North Korean attack on Seoul or Tokyo. Tillerson added that it was \"only a matter of time\" before Pyongyang targets the United States, and urged the international community to take concrete steps to prevent North Korea from carrying out its threats.\n\nTillerson's comments followed an intense week in Washington, during which the Trump administration held closed-door briefings with U.S. lawmakers regarding the escalating North Korean threat. The Trump administration aims to pressure North Korea into dismantling its missile and nuclear programs through tightened economic sanctions and diplomatic measures with allies and regional partners.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who also spoke at the meeting, condemned North Korea's violations of U.N. resolutions on nuclear and missile testing and development. Guterres expressed concern over the risk of a military escalation in the region.\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who also spoke at the meeting, pledged that Beijing would fully implement all U.N. sanctions on North Korea. Wang stated, \"Due to the recent efforts by [North Korea] to accelerate missile and nuclear development, China agrees to the international community to step up efforts of non-proliferation.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Tillerson told Fox News that he favored diplomatic sanctions as a means to bring North Korea into compliance. Tillerson's call for sanctions came as President Trump indicated direct conflict with the rogue regime is possible. Trump told Reuters, \"There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely.\" On the same day, Pyongyang released a propaganda video simulating an attack on the White House.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Faces Decision on Staying Utah Same-Sex Marriage Ruling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the last week, hundreds of same-sex couples have been married in Utah following a federal court ruling that overturned the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The question for the Supreme Court in the short term will be whether to block this ruling while appeals proceed.\n\nJudge Robert J. Shelby's decision has faced challenges, with a two-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver agreeing not to stay the ruling. The state's request for a stay will initially be directed to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a member of the court responsible for overseeing the Tenth Circuit. However, she is expected to refer the matter to the full court.\n\nThe Supreme Court will face difficult calculations, ones it did not have to confront in reviewing decisions from federal courts in California striking down Proposition 8, the state's ban on same-sex marriage. In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco stayed both the trial judge's ruling and its own as appeals went ahead.\n\nProfessor Dorf, a legal scholar, suggests that there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby's ruling. \"On the strictly legal argument,\" he said, \"it's hard to justify granting a stay.\"\n\nHowever, Professor Dorf added that the lower courts should have granted a stay, partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict. \"It's pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there,\" Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"If their hand is forced, as it now will be, it's impossible to say with certainty what they'll do.\"\n\nWhatever the Supreme Court does regarding a stay, it is hard to see how it could hear the larger issue in the case in the current term. However, a decision in the court's next term, culminating in a decision in June 2015, is entirely possible.",
    " Title: John Kasich Suspends Presidential Campaign, Leaves Trump as Presumptive Republican Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Kasich, known for his conciliatory approach in a tumultuous election year, suspended his presidential campaign on Wednesday, leaving Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee. The Ohio governor's decision leaves Trump as the sole remaining candidate in the race.\n\nTrump, in response, sounded conciliatory, stating that Kasich might be helpful in the general election and expressing interest in vetting him as a potential vice presidential running mate.\n\nKasich's withdrawal was met with mixed reactions. Some viewed his exit as a loss of civility in the race, while others saw it as a strategic move that could have united anti-Trump forces.\n\nDespite Kasich's strategic goal of a one-on-one match-up with Trump, he ultimately chose to withdraw, given Trump's strong lead and the Republican National Committee chairman's reference to Trump as the \"presumptive nominee.\"\n\nKasich's campaign was not without challenges. He won only his home state of Ohio and was at less than 20 percent in the national polls in a three-man race by the end. Technically, Kasich finished in fourth place, even though he was the last losing contender to drop out.\n\nThe question remains whether Trump would consider Kasich as a running mate and if Kasich would accept such an offer. Trump has expressed a preference for a politician as a vice president, and the Ohio governor would provide balance in terms of experience and message. However, the pair never clashed significantly, and Trump has mocked Kasich's losing ways and his eating habits.\n\nFor Kasich, a vice presidential slot might validate his quixotic effort and provide a cap to his long and varied political career. However, joining Trump's campaign would mean aligning with a candidate who has shown little eagerness to embrace light and hope, qualities Kasich has often associated with himself.",
    " Title: Armed School Officer's Response to Florida School Shooting Draws Criticism from President Trump\n\n Article:\n\n U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the armed officer who stood outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, during last week's shooting that left 17 people dead. The officer, Scot Peterson, resigned after an investigation found he failed to confront the suspect.\n\n Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday, President Trump described Mr. Peterson as a \"coward\" who \"did not react properly under pressure.\" He added, \"He trained his whole life but when it came time to do something, he did not have the courage.\"\n\n Florida Governor Rick Scott, meanwhile, has called for law enforcement officers to be placed in every public school in the state. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, President Trump proposed arming teachers as a solution to school safety, a method long championed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby.\n\n Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel revealed on Thursday that Mr. Peterson, the 54-year-old school resource officer, stood outside while the alleged gunman shot students at the high school. He said video footage showed Mr. Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said.\n\n \"I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,\" Sheriff Israel said. Asked what Mr. Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said, \"Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer.\"\n\n Mr. Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. It is unclear if he will face charges.\n\n The suspect used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being captured later. School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. They document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education.\n\n There are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the U.S., according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr. Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper said he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (\u00a354,137).\n\n Concerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about the former student charged with the massacre were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. Calls were also reportedly made to the authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about the suspect, including one saying he was planning to attack the school.\n\n A transcript of one call to the FBI was released to U.S. media on Friday, in which a tipster warns that the suspect \"wants to kill people\" and that \"he's going to explode.\" The female caller, whose identification was redacted in the report, said that the suspect once brought a bird inside \"threw it on his mother's kitchen counter and he started cutting it up.\" She also warned that the suspect was receiving an inheritance of $25,000 per year, and that he may spend that money on guns.\n\n Governor Rick Scott called for \"active shooter training\" for all students and staff at public schools in the state. He said he planned to raise Florida's minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old. Governor Scott also pledged to make it \"virtually impossible for anyone who has mental health issues to use guns.\"\n\n \"If a court involuntarily commits someone because they are a risk to themselves or others, they would be required to surrender all firearms and not regain the right to purchase or possess a firearm until a court hearing,\" he said during a speech about a new proposal on guns in Tallahassee.\n\n President Trump added, \"What I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus.\"\n\n However, Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union, disagreed that arming teachers was a suitable solution. \"Anyone who wants guns in schools has no understanding of what goes on inside them - or worse, does not care,\" she said.",
    " Title: North Korean Troops' Loyalty to Kim Jong Un: A Former South Korean General's Warning\n\nArticle:\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. In-Bum Chun, a decorated former South Korean military leader, has warned that a potential war with North Korea would not be like toppling former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but more akin to trying to eliminate Allah. Chun, who spent nearly 40 years in the South Korean military, including a stint leading the country's special forces, made these remarks at a London think tank this week.\n\nChun, who has firsthand knowledge of North Korea, described the North Korean military as highly indoctrinated and potentially employing kamikaze-style attacks due to the age of their aircraft. The North Korean air force has around 1,000 planes, and North Korean soldiers receive 100 hours of weapon training annually starting at the age of 14.\n\nThe general's primary concern, however, is the loyalty of North Korean troops and citizens to Kim Jong Un during a foreign invasion. This loyalty is attributed to the country's system of mutual surveillance, where North Koreans spy on other North Koreans. Defectors who have spoken to Chun have expressed an innate belief in the system, despite having defected.\n\nChun used religious language to describe the North Korean soldiers' aggression, stating that they revere members of the Kim family, who have led the country for decades, as gods. The first leader was Kim Jong Un's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, who was in power from 1948 to 1994. He is still known today as the \"Great Leader\" and the \"Eternal President,\" and monuments glorifying his reign are everywhere in the country.\n\nSince Kim Il Sung's death in 1994, his son and grandson, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un, have carried on his legacy. The current Kim has made some economic reforms and put more emphasis on improving the nuclear and missile programs. However, they purposely demonstrate in their own propaganda how closely they hew to Kim Il Sung's style of governance.\n\nKim Jong Un even goes out of his way to look as much like his grandfather as he possibly can in hopes of inspiring the same admiration his grandfather did. More than 400,000 North Korean soldiers died or went missing fighting for Kim Il Sung in the Korean War. The frightening reality is that many, many more might be willing to fight to the death if war came to the peninsula once again.\n\nIt's important to note that a war with North Korea is still very unlikely. North and South Korea are currently engaged in diplomatic negotiations for the first time in more than two years. On January 4, North Korea reopened a military crisis hotline with its southern neighbor after nearly two years of silence, a move that could lower the chances of an accidental war between the two longtime foes. And on Tuesday, Pyongyang agreed to send its athletes to the Olympics in South Korea next month.\n\nWar may not be imminent, but it's crucial to understand the potential consequences of such a conflict.",
    " Title: Florida Governor Rick Scott Accuses Sen. Bill Nelson of Fraud in Closely Contested Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott declared on Sunday that he has won the closely contested Senate race against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, accusing his opponent of \"committing fraud\" to steal the election. Scott made these statements during an interview on Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe Florida Senate race is one of three statewide contests that will undergo an automatic recount, following the unofficial deadline for counties to report results. As of Saturday, Scott's lead over Nelson had narrowed significantly, with Scott ahead by just over 12,000 votes as Democrat-rich counties like Broward County continued to report additional numbers.\n\nDuring the interview, Scott repeated his allegations of fraud without evidence, suggesting that the increase in votes for Nelson is a result of fraudulent activities. Both Scott and President Donald Trump have accused Democrats of attempting to \"steal\" the election.\n\nScott's comments center around two issues that surfaced after Election Day. In one case, Nelson's team of lawyers objected to the cancellation of a ballot cast by a noncitizen, who is barred from voting. In another case, Nelson's lawyers are seeking a judge's permission to count all absentee ballots, including those where the signature on the mail-in envelope doesn't match the signature of the voter in file.\n\nThe governor also stated that he has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate potential fraud. However, both the department and the secretary of state, agencies that Scott oversees as governor, have previously stated that there is no evidence of fraud.\n\nNelson and his legal team have maintained that the increase in votes for the incumbent is due to the counting of previously uncounted votes.\n\nAs the recount begins, Scott stated that he has \"already won the race two times\" and intends to be sworn in as Florida's junior senator. Sen. Nelson was also invited to appear on the show but declined.\n\nThe Senate currently stands at 51 Republicans to 46 Democrats. Races in Arizona (where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema leads Republican Martha McSally) and Mississippi (which is headed to a runoff later this month) are also still to be resolved.",
    " Title: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Expresses Doubts on Repealing the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has expressed doubts about the possibility of repealing the health care law. The Kentucky Republican stated on Monday that it is challenging to undo a law of such magnitude, referring to the 2,700-page health care law.\n\nMcConnell made these comments during visits to Hardin Memorial Hospital in Elizabetown, discussing the law's future following last week's Supreme Court ruling that the law was constitutional. The court upheld the law's crucial mandate that individuals buy health insurance or face a penalty. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, provided the pivotal vote in that decision by ruling that the penalty was legal under the government's taxing authority.\n\nWhile the federal government passing a massive new entitlement program, such as the Affordable Care Act, makes it difficult to repeal it, McConnell's views on the subject are less cynical. He suggests that electing new members of Congress, as well as a new president, is the surest way to repeal the law, which has been consistently despised by more than half of Americans since its enactment two years ago.\n\nIf given control of the Senate next year, McConnell stated he would support using budget reconciliation rules to repeal the law. This approach would prohibit Senate filibusters and require only 51 votes to succeed. In 2010, Republicans criticized Democrats for relying on these rules to pass the health care bill, labeling their tactics as unusual and hyperpartisan.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to uphold the law may, in fact, make it easier for lawmakers to repeal it. While the constitutionality of the mandate has been resolved, millions of Americans will still be uninsured, health care costs will remain high, and all Americans, including those who refuse to buy health insurance, will still be taxed. In short, if this isn't motivation enough to elect leaders who will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with more practical and sensible reforms, it is unclear what will.",
    " Title: Justice Department Seeks Public Tips for Potential Civil Rights Case Against George Zimmerman\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) is soliciting email tips and information regarding the case of George Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch volunteer, as it deliberates a possible federal civil rights case against him. This move appears to expand the ongoing investigation, following Attorney General Eric Holder's statement on Tuesday to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that the department would \"consider all available information\" before deciding whether to proceed.\n\nOn Monday, the DOJ held a conference call with civil rights leaders, including those from Sanford, Florida, and other parts of the country. The call was organized by Tom Perez, the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. The department has previously used such tip lines in high-profile investigations, such as the probe last year of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, police department.\n\nSome legal experts have expressed doubts about the feasibility of a civil rights case against Zimmerman, given that the current investigation has reportedly found no evidence or claims of racial bias. Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by Zimmerman, was African-American. However, some lawmakers seem to have already reached a conclusion.\n\n\"We do know that Mr. Martin's civil rights have been violated,\" said Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.), with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus expressing similar views.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing investigation, Holder has taken further action in response to the acquittal. On Tuesday, he criticized \"stand-your-ground\" laws, which permit individuals to use lethal force when they believe their lives are in danger, even if they have the option to retreat. The National Rifle Association (NRA) criticized Holder for these comments, stating that self-defense is a \"fundamental human right.\"\n\nHolder also shared his own experiences with racial profiling during his address to the NAACP.",
    " Title: U.S. Troop Withdrawal from Northern Syria Sparks Controversy and Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has sparked criticism from both political sides, with concerns that the move could lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State (ISIS) and damage U.S. credibility as a reliable ally.\n\nThe withdrawal, announced on Sunday evening, has been met with criticism due to the potential consequences for ISIS and the Kurdish-led forces in the region. The Kurds have been key partners in the fight against ISIS, and their abandonment could lead to the release of tens of thousands of former militants and family members currently held in Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) controlled camps.\n\nThe decision has been described as a \"stunning\" and \"betrayal\" of the Kurds, who have been historically betrayed by the U.S. in their relationship. The U.S. has been a key ally to the Kurds, but the latest betrayal has been particularly concerning given President Trump's repeated claims of defeating the Islamic State and restoring U.S. credibility with traditional Middle Eastern allies.\n\nThe U.S. partnership with the Kurds in Syria occurred after three years of failed attempts to get Turkey to stop supporting radical and extremist groups in Syria. About 90% of foreign fighters entering Iraq and Syria to fight with al Qaeda or the Islamic State traversed the Turkish border, often with the facilitation of Turkish security forces.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. forces and the greenlighting of a Turkish incursion could lead to a revival of the Islamic State and renewed conflict in one of the only peaceful parts of Syria. It may also foreshadow terrorism and civil war inside Turkey, as the Kurds in northeastern Syria were their safe-haven.\n\nThe decision has also been criticized for potentially putting the U.S. on a collision course with Turkey, as President Erdo\u011fan has been more of an adversary of the U.S. than an ally, strategically aligning with both Russia and Iran. The Kurds in Rojava are a bulwark not just against ISIS but against perfidious action by all three of those regimes unfriendly to America.\n\nThe decision has also put President Trump in conflict with the Pentagon and his own Republican allies, and there is speculation that he may walk back the decision in part or in whole. However, the decision has raised questions about the U.S.'s reliability as a stalwart partner and determined adversary in the eyes of U.S. allies and foes alike.",
    " Title: Bill Clinton Delivers Bipartisan-Themed Address, Highlights Decades of Interaction with Bob Dole\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton's decades-long interactions with Bob Dole were a recurring theme in Clinton's bipartisan-focused address at the University of Kansas on Monday.\n\n\"One of the things I always liked about Bob Dole is that he could fight you like there's no tomorrow, but he never closed the door on something that could help a real person,\" Clinton said. He added that no matter what else the two men were doing, they kept their doors open, \"and we found a way to try to do what's best for the American people.\"\n\nClinton, a Democrat and the 42nd president of the United States, was in Lawrence to accept the 2015 Dole Leadership prize, an annual award bestowed by KU's Dole Institute of Politics, named after the former Republican U.S. Senator from Kansas. Dole, 92, did not attend the event.\n\nClinton described the current age as the most \"interdependent\" in human history, one in which positive and negative forces are colliding. He emphasized bipartisanship as the key to ensuring a prosperous future, urging America and the world to focus on shared goals instead of differences.\n\n\"The polarization of American politics is present not just in Washington but in American life,\" Clinton told a capacity crowd at the 2,210-seat Lied Center auditorium on the KU campus.\n\nClinton highlighted the progress made in overcoming bigotry in America over the past 100 years, stating that the country is less racist, sexist, religiously bigoted, homophobic, and intolerant of those who disagree.\n\nClinton attributed Dole's ability to identify with others to an experience Dole had while lying in the hospital recovering from wounds sustained in World War II. Clinton said this ability to empathize is the essence of the test we all face today.\n\nClinton referenced his autobiography, stating that he had pulled for Dole over other Republican contenders during an election. He believed that if he lost, the country would be in more solid and moderate hands with Dole.\n\nClinton emphasized the importance of diverse groups making decisions and working together, stating that in the face of insecurity, the most predictable path is to stick to one's own kind and push others away.\n\nIn the age of smartphones, the internet, and globalization, \"we can't escape each other,\" Clinton said.\n\nThroughout his address, Clinton interspersed references to current events, examples of efforts initiated during his term as president, as well as recent efforts by his charitable foundation, the Clinton Foundation. One cause Clinton worked on with Dole was the Families of Freedom Fund, initiated after Clinton left the White House to provide education funding for the survivors of those killed in 9/11, regardless of citizenship. So far, the fund has awarded $118 million.\n\nOne of the missions of the Dole Institute is to foster civil dialogue about political and economic issues in a balanced and bipartisan environment. The Dole Institute stated that Clinton was selected for the prize this year \"for his work balancing the budget and practicing bipartisanship while in office.\"\n\nOther recipients of the prize have included former Sen. George McGovern, former Polish President Lech Walesa, former President George H.W. Bush, and former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n\nAfter leaving office in 2001, Clinton established the Clinton Foundation, which funds health care, human rights, and economic development programs both domestically and internationally. Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton, is considered the Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 race for president.\n\nThe Dole Leadership prize comes with a $25,000 award, which Clinton has chosen to donate back to the Dole Institute. Dole Institute director Bill Lacy said the money will seed the Dole Institute's new Women and Leadership Lecture Series, expected to launch in the next couple of years.",
    " Title: Republican Party Shifts Strategy: Establishment Candidates to Receive Unlimited Funding from Super PACs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is undergoing a significant strategic shift in its approach to funding, with establishment candidates receiving unlimited funds from Super PACs to fend off challenges from the Tea Party. This change marks the biggest reevaluation of the Republican Party's outside money strategy since the dawn of the super PAC era.\n\nConsultants and attorneys, including the co-founder of the pro-Mitt Romney super PAC, are laying the groundwork or have already filed paperwork for dozens of super PACs organized to support individual candidates running in the upcoming years. These super PACs are permitted to raise and spend unlimited funds, unlike congressional campaigns, but are forbidden from coordinating with the campaigns.\n\nThe strategy shift reflects the growing internal conflict within the Republican Party, which is likely to characterize the 2014 and 2016 campaigns. The Senate Conservatives Fund, a group that has vowed to attack GOP candidates deemed insufficiently conservative, is one example of this internal conflict.\n\nIn recent election cycles, well-established conservative groups like Karl Rove's Crossroads network and the Koch-linked Americans for Prosperity have largely stayed out of primary fights. However, tea party-associated groups have helped unseat more moderate Republicans in these contests.\n\nThe shift in strategy is a response to donors' dissatisfaction with the results of big money groups in recent years and their willingness to take their funds elsewhere. This is evident in the rise of single-candidate super PACs, a sign that party leaders believe donors are seeking more accountability and metrics in their investments.\n\nIn the special Massachusetts Senate election to replace John Kerry in 2013, a single donor bankrolled the deceptively-named Americans for Progressive Action on behalf of GOP senate candidate Gabriel Gomez, despite major GOP groups like Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity taking a pass on the race. This trend suggests a shift in donor focus from relationships to accountability, as donors are now asking for detailed strategic plans before making contributions.",
    " Title: Polling Data Suggests Tightening Race Between Clinton and Trump Ahead of Election Day\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election approaches, the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has shown signs of tightening, despite months of polling data suggesting a more stable outcome for Clinton. Polling aggregators and election prediction markets have consistently shown Clinton with a lead over Trump, but the race has become more unpredictable following the announcement by F.B.I. Director James Comey regarding the renewal of an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, Trump currently lags behind Clinton by just 3.3 points in a polls-only forecast. In 2012, average polling was off by 2.7 points, and if this trend were to repeat in 2016, it could be enough to flip states like Wisconsin and Minnesota from Clinton's column to Trump's.\n\nThere is a degree of variation among polling aggregators, data scientists, and political analysts. While HuffPost Pollster, which excludes outlier polls, currently gives Clinton a 97.9% chance of victory, Nate Silver's model is more conservative, giving Clinton a 68.1% chance to account for increased volatility.\n\nSome analysts, such as neuroscientist Sam Wang, who out-predicted Silver in 2012, argue that while individual polls may show a narrow lead for Clinton, Trump's rise should not be confused with momentum. Wang suggests that voter opinion has become entrenched, and the movement of voter opinion has been within a narrow range. He believes that if the regression to the mean holds, there will be a little movement back to Clinton, but the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nIn conclusion, while polling data has consistently shown a lead for Clinton, the race between Clinton and Trump has become more unpredictable in the final weeks leading up to the election. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, and voters should remain informed and vigilant as they make their decisions.",
    " Title: Democratic Debate Highlights Diverse Field and Challenges for Biden\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second night of the opening Democratic debates in Miami on Thursday showcased a competitive field of candidates, with California Senator Kamala Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg emerging as standouts. The debate expanded the possibilities of the Democratic contest, as both Harris and Buttigieg were crisp and commanding, driving the conversation more than front-runner Joe Biden and second-ranked Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe debate highlighted the unprecedented diversity of the Democratic field in terms of demography and generation. The participants included six women, two African Americans, a Latino, and an openly gay man. The contrast in age was striking, with South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37, standing to the right of Joe Biden, who is 76 and already served in the U.S. Senate for nine years by the time Buttigieg was born.\n\nOne of the most notable moments of the debate came when Senator Harris directly addressed Biden, stating, \"I do not believe that you are a racist,\" before discussing his recent comments on his compromises with segregationists in the Senate and his opposition to school busing. Biden, in response, accused Harris of mischaracterizing his comments and his position on busing.\n\nBiden's performance left some of his supporters concerned, and Harris's performance made her the top trending topic on Google for a time. Biden was folksy, but he failed to articulate a clear vision for his presidency. Harris was forceful, displaying the prosecutor's skills she honed as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general. However, her decision to raise her hand when asked which candidates would eliminate private health insurance as part of Medicare-for-All could complicate her appeal to more moderate Democrats in the primaries.\n\nButtigieg also had a good night, coming across as low-key and thoughtful when he was asked about a fatal police shooting in South Bend last week. \"It's a mess, and we're hurting,\" Buttigieg said, stating that he had taken some steps but not enough to deal with the issue before the tragedy happened.\n\nThe debates gave most candidates the biggest audiences of their lives, a chance to break through with voters across the country who had never seen them before. More than 15 million people watched on Wednesday, according to NBC. After the opening night, former Housing secretary Julian Castro and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker got an immediate boost from what were seen as strong appearances.\n\nThe debates also marked a historic moment, as Buttigieg became the first openly LGBTQ candidate in a presidential debate. The debates spotlighted the diversity of the Democratic field and the need for a new generation to take over, as California Representative Eric Swalwell argued. The debates will continue with 11 more debates scheduled, including a second next month in Detroit. The opening Iowa caucuses are still more than seven months away.",
    " Title: Obama's Limited Role in 2014 Midterm Campaign Contrasts with 2010 Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's role in the 2014 midterm campaign stands in stark contrast to his active participation in the 2010 campaign, as evidenced by a rally on October 10, 2010, where he urged supporters with the famous phrase, \"Are you fired up? Are you ready to go?\" At a Philadelphia park, the crowd responded with the iconic chant, \"Yes we can!\"\n\nFour years later, on Thursday, October 10, 2014, Obama was speaking to a small group of wealthy donors at actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Los Angeles home, far from the public eye. His tone was markedly different from the energetic rally of 2010.\n\n\"Democrats have many good qualities, but a congenital disease is, A: We get depressed too easily; and B: We're terrible at paying attention to midterm elections,\" Obama said.\n\nNo cameras were allowed at the event, and no local Democratic candidates received a presidential shout-out. Obama's low-key appearance at Paltrow's home was not an exception this year; he has headlined no public campaign events this election cycle, and since Labor Day, he has appeared in person with only two candidates\u2014in the Democratic states of California and Illinois.\n\nBy this point four years ago, Obama had led three rallies, and in the weeks since Labor Day, he had held political events with five candidates, even with an approval rating of 47%, according to the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll at the time.\n\nNow, with his approval at a low-water mark of 40%, according to the Journal/NBC poll, the president has been relegated to fundraising and small, targeted photo-ops like one he did Thursday when he dropped by the Los Angeles campaign office of House candidate Ted Lieu.\n\nRep. Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he hoped Obama's appearance with Lieu was \"a preview of similar engagements by the president.\"\n\n\"We'd love to see more of that,\" Mr. Israel said.\n\nThe president's campaign schedule will pick up in coming weeks, with the White House announcing a Connecticut rally next week. However, the contrast between 2010 and 2014 is likely to become more evident as the fight for control of the Senate is the year's top battle.\n\nAdministration officials say much of Obama's time on the campaign trail will be spent stumping for gubernatorial and House candidates. With Obama so unpopular in most states with close Senate races this fall, Democratic candidates are putting as much distance between themselves and the president as they can.\n\nAt a newspaper editorial board meeting on Thursday, Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Kentucky, refused three times to say whether she had even voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, saying instead that she is \"a Clinton Democrat through and through.\"\n\nThe White House has yet to announce any campaign events Obama will hold with Democratic Senate candidates, though he has recorded get-out-the-vote phone calls, radio ads, and videos for them to target selected constituencies.\n\nThe campaign of Charlie Crist, Florida's Democratic candidate for governor, is now wary of inviting Obama to publicly appear with him out of concern that it would shift the focus of the race to national issues, according to a person familiar with Crist's campaign strategy.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg survey found that an endorsement from Obama would leave a more negative view of a congressional or Senate candidate, with 38% saying they would see a candidate less favorably, compared with just 28% who would have a more favorable view after a presidential endorsement.\n\nFindings like those are one reason that Republicans say they welcome Obama's just-announced campaign stop with Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy. A Malloy spokesman said the governor is happy to stand with the president and discuss shared views on issues like the minimum wage and gun laws.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders say Obama can play an important role in the campaign. Each of the three states with the highest concentration of competitive House races\u2014New York, California, and Illinois\u2014is friendly Obama territory, Mr. Israel said.\n\nHowever, White House officials say Obama wants to help Democrats in the weeks before the Nov. 4 election, even if that means staying away from them. Last week, after Obama said that while he isn't on the ballot this November, his policies are, Republican Senate candidates rushed to produce ads replaying the remark. At Thursday's fundraiser at Ms. Paltrow's house, Obama tweaked the comment, saying instead \"our values\" and \"our ideals\" are on the ballot.\n\nMany presidents have seen a similar downgrade in their role in midterm elections as their popularity wanes. Republicans distanced themselves from George W. Bush in 2006 as his popularity fell over the Iraq war. \"There are always places where the incumbent president just isn't popular,\" said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist.\n\nIn the absence of campaign rallies this cycle, Obama has maintained a busy fundraising schedule, headlining 58 events so far this year, with another on tap Saturday. That is comparable to his 2010 schedule, said Brendan Doherty, an associate professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy who compiles presidential-fundraising data.\n\nDavid Winston, a Republican strategist, said the White House has a long-term interest in demonstrating that Obama still has some political capital. \"If there was a sense that he was in a situation where he couldn't help any Democratic candidate, that's just not a good setup for his last two years,\" Mr. Winston said.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Decreased Family Time During Thanksgiving Due to Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the journal Science this week reveals that families with mixed political views spent less time together during Thanksgiving in 2016 compared to families with similar political beliefs. The study, conducted by Keith Chen of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Ryne Rohla of Washington State University, used smartphone location data to analyze the duration of Thanksgiving dinners in politically polarized households.\n\nThe researchers found that families with mixed politics spent 20 to 50 minutes fewer at the table than politically like-minded groups. The difference was more pronounced among Republicans, who left earlier than Democrats, with some Republicans leaving more than an hour earlier. Democrats were more likely to skip the holiday altogether. The effect was three times stronger in areas with heavy political advertising.\n\nThe study's authors estimate that partisan differences cost Americans 73.6 million person-hours of family time that Thanksgiving. Political psychologist John Jost of New York University, who was not involved in the research, finds the study intriguing. \"In recent years political scientists have done an admirable job of documenting the political costs of asymmetric polarization,\" Jost says. \"This new work suggests that there may be social and personal\u2014even familial\u2014costs as well.\"\n\nThe researchers initially set out to study the nation's growing geographic polarization but became interested in the potential impact of political disagreements on family gatherings after hearing anecdotal reports of a rocky holiday in 2016 following Donald Trump's shock win over Hillary Clinton. To measure the effects of political disagreements on Thanksgiving festivities, Chen and Rohla used communication and location technology.\n\nThey obtained smartphone location data from a company called SafeGraph, which was gathered via partner applications such as weather or navigation apps that ask permission to log coordinates. The resulting anonymous, aggregated data sets reported the locations of some 10 million smartphones at various points in time. Chen and Rohla overlaid that data with voting tallies by precinct, each representing about 200 to 1,000 people who used the same polling place.\n\nThe researchers then made some assumptions based on probability. They took their best guess at what precinct a person lived in by asking where their smartphone was from 1 A.M. to 4 A.M., most mornings. For example, if a smartphone's location data suggested a person was 80% likely to be a Clinton voter, the researchers could then look at where the person spent Thanksgiving dinner and how long they spent at Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nTo ensure the effect they identified was political, the researchers took several additional steps. They compared meal lengths for matched pairs of families who lived within a mile of each other and had traveled to eat with host families who lived equally close. Of these, families with a higher probability of tearing into each other over the turkey did indeed prove more likely to leave early.\n\nNext, the scientists compared Thanksgivings in 2016 and 2015. Families who were more likely to be politically distant yet ate together in 2015 were less likely to do so in 2016. Finally, Chen and Rohla considered the effect of political advertising. Voters in states such as New York and California saw almost no political ads, while those in Orlando, Florida, for example, were exposed to more than 20,000 political television ads during the campaign. In such saturated areas, the diminishment of time together at Thanksgiving tripled.\n\nSome critics of the study note that a presidential election year is different in many ways from the years on either side, so comparing 2015 to 2016 would be of limited use. Chen and Rohla do not disagree. They plan to analyze the aftermath of the 2018 midterm elections, but they recognize that 2020 and subsequent presidential election years will better clarify what happened in 2016.\n\nOthers have expressed concern about the use of smartphone data, considering it an invasion of privacy. Chen and Rohla point to the anonymity of the data and the fact that the applications involved require permission. \"They do have to allow the location,\" Rohla says. \"My feeling is that math-geolocated data is going to be at the forefront of a lot of social science going forward.\"\n\nMethodology aside, the authors say they have captured a trend they would like to see disappear. \"I hope the effect is short-lived and that American families find a way past this,\" Chen says. Rohla can attest at least one family\u2014his own\u2014did. \"Everyone learned their lesson in 2017,\" he says. \"It was much better.\"",

Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, announced during a news conference on Monday at the White House that anyone in need due to the hurricane would be allowed entry, regardless of travel documentation.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump later contradicted this open-arms sentiment, stating that everyone fleeing the storm \"needs totally proper documentation\" to seek assistance in the U.S. Trump expressed concerns about allowing individuals who were not supposed to be in the Bahamas to enter the United States, citing potential security risks, including \"very bad people and some very bad gang members and some very very bad drug dealers.\"\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, existing U.S. policy allows for Bahamians to enter the United States without a visa by providing a passport and proof of no criminal record and going through pre-screening conducted by CBP in Freeport and Nassau.

    " Title: Georgia Grand Jury to Review Fatal Shooting of Ahmaud Arbery\n\nArticle:\n\nThe fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man in Georgia, is gaining widespread attention following the release of a graphic video showing the incident. Ahmaud Arbery was killed on February 23, after being pursued by two armed white men, Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis McMichael.\n\nAccording to a police report, Gregory McMichael spotted Arbery jogging and called 911 to report a \"black man running down the street,\" suspecting him of being involved in recent burglaries. McMichael called his son, and the pair armed themselves before tracking Arbery down on the road.\n\nThe police report states that Gregory McMichael told officers he and his son first tried to stop Arbery by shouting, \"Stop, stop, we want to talk to you!\" The father claimed that Arbery attacked his son, and they got into a struggle for a shotgun. Police said the son fired two shots.\n\nArbery's family maintains he was simply out for a jog at the time. The video shows a black man running at a slow pace toward a white truck that is stopped in the middle of a country road. Two men are seen outside the vehicle, including one standing on the truck's bed. The black man seems to attempt to run around the truck, and the moment he clears the vehicle, a shot rings out.\n\nA brief struggle ensues in what looks like an effort to control a shotgun, and another two shots are heard, according to the video. The runner staggers away and collapses. The man in the truck's bed is seen holding a handgun after he climbs out to approach the others.\n\nGeorgia's Republican Governor, Brian Kemp, spoke out, noting that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation was assisting the prosecutor who has been placed on the case \"to ensure a thorough, independent investigation into the death of # AhmaudArbery.\"\n\nGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr said, \"I am deeply concerned with the events surrounding the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery,\" in a brief statement. A grand jury will be reviewing the case.\n\nThe public developments in the case have prompted calls for justice from various lawmakers and public figures, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who tweeted, \"Justice must be blind. Bring # Ahmaud Arbery's killers to justice.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who is a former prosecutor, expressed surprise that it took the video being released to get prosecutors to ask for a grand jury review. \"I guess my first question would be, why did it take the video [becoming public]?\" Gowdy asked Fox News' Dana Perino on \"The Daily Briefing.\" \"If you have someone who is jogging, who is unarmed, who is shot and killed by officers who are not officers\u2014they are not even law enforcement officers\u2014why did they take video?\"\n\nThe video has also prompted comments from other public figures, including former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who said, \"It looks like murder. It looks like vigilante behavior that should be charged and criminalized.\" Abrams also called for the police to detain the McMichaels, who have not been charged, in the meantime.\n\nThe McMichaels are expected to remain free until at least June 13, due to Georgia's orders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, as a grand jury would not be able to convene until then. Some have called for the police to detain the McMichaels until their trial.",
    " Title: Comedian Louis C.K. and Action Star Chuck Norris Criticize Common Core Academic Standards, Sparking Debate and Pop Culture Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Common Core academic standards, once widely hailed as a bipartisan success story, are now facing criticism from both liberals and conservatives, with comedian Louis C.K. and action star Chuck Norris among the latest to voice their disapproval. The debate over the standards has intensified, with the issue dominating education policy debates and roiling political campaigns for over a year.\n\nThis week, Louis C.K. tweeted to his 3.3 million followers, \"My kids used to love math. Now it makes them cry. Thanks standardized testing and common core!\" He followed this with several pictures of third-grade math problems he deemed incomprehensible or nonsensical. Within a day, his original protest had been retweeted over 7,000 times. He continued his criticism on Thursday evening, tweeting, \"Kids, teachers, parents are vocally suffering. Doesn't that matter? Listen to them. Adapt and slow down CCSS. Cool it with the testing.\"\n\nThe tweets highlight a significant challenge for the Common Core. Proponents aim to focus attention on the goal of raising academic standards and preparing American students for a global economy. However, parents are more concerned about their children crying over confusing homework and experiencing test-day anxiety, which are the stories that resonate, particularly on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nComedy Central's Stephen Colbert and authors Judy Blume, Maya Angelou, and Matt Damon have also weighed in with critiques on standardized testing. The populist attack on Common Core is not always fair, as some of the most widely mocked examples of so-called Common Core math were featured in textbooks and used in classrooms before the standards were introduced. The blame for some of the confusing assignments rests on individual teachers, not the standards, which outline what children should learn in each grade but do not dictate lesson plans or homework. High-stakes testing was also introduced before the Common Core and can be stressful for some students regardless of the exams' content.\n\nOpposition activist Jim Stergios acknowledges that he would prefer to focus on more sober-minded critiques of the \"mediocre quality, dubious legality, and outsized costs\" of the Common Core. However, he admits that he is not displeased that complaints about the standards have become a pop culture meme.\n\n\"You know that discomfort and even outright opposition has reached a critical mass when the core becomes a frequent punch line in the repertoire of late-night comedians,\" said Stergios, executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank.\n\nSupporters of the Common Core acknowledge that the campaign against the standards is taking a toll. \"What harms the cause for improving education in this country is the attempt by the opposition and the media, who should know better, to perpetuate these misunderstandings, until eventually people think they are truths,\" said Cheryl Oldham, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.\n\nThe Common Core exams were introduced as the next generation of standardized tests, requiring students to write more, analyze complex texts, and perform hands-on experiments in the classroom. Backers hoped parents would embrace them as far more challenging and meaningful than traditional fill-in-the-bubble multiple-choice tests.\n\nHowever, due to the new components, the exams are longer than many states' former assessments. They are taken on computers, which this spring have proven vulnerable to crashes, server outages, and even cyberterrorism. Common Core exams are graded on a tougher curve, leading to high failure rates in states that adopted them last year. Additionally, recent tests given to students in New York featured questions studded with brand names like Nike and iPod, raising concerns about commercialization.\n\nAny parents who saw benefits in the new exams were swiftly drowned out by the chorus of protests on social media. By the tens of thousands, parents have refused to let their children take the tests. They have taken to social media to explain why. And their fury has seeped into pop culture.\n\nColbert aired a series of clips of parents explaining how the tests had rattled and stressed their children. His wry conclusion: \"Common Core testing is preparing students for what they'll face as adults\u2014pointless stress and confusion.\"",
    " Title: President Trump's Grand Welcome in Saudi Arabia Kicks Off First Foreign Trip\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first foreign trip as the U.S. President began on Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with an elaborate red carpet ceremony at the Royal Court Palace. King Salman of Saudi Arabia greeted the president, who was presented with the Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Saudi nation's highest honor.\n\nUpon arrival at King Khalid International Airport, the Trumps were greeted by King Salman, with Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Trump exiting the jet from the back steps before the president. Ivanka wore an ankle-length dress, while the first lady was dressed in a flowing black jumpsuit and a gold belt.\n\nThe president and first lady then walked into the terminal, where a coffee reception with King Salman was held. The pair spoke through an interpreter inside the terminal, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe high-profile welcome stands in stark contrast to the low-key reception President Barack Obama received in the kingdom last year. The Saudis offered Trump an elaborate welcome, with billboards featuring his image lining the highways of Riyadh and the luxury hotel bathed in red, white, and blue lights.\n\nDuring the hours leading up to Trump's arrival in Riyadh, White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted photos of the city's preparations.\n\nThe trip marks the first time a U.S. president has made Saudi Arabia, a Muslim-majority country, his first stop. After Saudi Arabia, the president will travel to Israel, Italy, Vatican City, and Belgium. During the trip, Trump will meet with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Pope Francis, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, King Philippe of Belgium, and the leaders of the G7 countries, among others.\n\nThe president will take part in bilateral meetings with the Saudi royal leadership while in the kingdom. The Trumps will join the Saudi royal family for an official dinner Saturday night. On Sunday, Trump will deliver a speech at the Arab-Islamic-American Summit on U.S. relations with the Muslim world and the global effort to confront religious extremism and promote moderation. He will also help inaugurate a \"Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology.\" The president will also attend meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council members.",
    " Title: Justice Department Inspector General Criticizes FBI for Errors in Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday, rebuking the FBI for \"failures\" during the initial phase of the Russia probe. Horowitz's testimony followed his extensive report on the investigation's origins and the process used to obtain a surveillance warrant for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nHorowitz revealed that there were 17 inaccuracies and omissions in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications for Page, which included a doctored email and the failure to include exculpatory information about Page that may have impacted the court's decision to grant the warrants.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned the FBI's actions during the hearing, asking, \"Were they just all incompetent?\" Hawley noted the complexities involved and stated, \"It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re very stupid to me.\"\n\nHorowitz clarified that he did not reach any conclusions regarding intent but did not necessarily accept the reasons people provided during his investigation. He stated, \"There are so many errors, we couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion or make a determination on what motivated those failures other than we did not credit what we lay out here were the explanations we got.\"\n\nThis echoed Horowitz's statement in his opening remarks, where he made clear that \"although we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence of intentional misconduct, we also did not receive satisfactory explanations for the errors or the missing information and the failures that occurred.\"\n\nHorowitz previously appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the aftermath of his report on the subject, but Wednesday's hearing before the Senate homeland security panel comes a day after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) sharply criticized the FBI in a rare public order that referenced his findings.\n\nHorowitz stated that both Justice Department attorneys and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \"should have been given complete and accurate information,\" adding, \"That did not occur and as a result, the surveillance of Carter Page continued even as the FBI gathered evidence and information that weakened the assessment of probable cause and made the FISA applications less accurate.\"\n\nAfter Horowitz released his report, Democrats defending the Russia investigation pointed to the lack of a determination of political bias as evidence that President Trump's campaign was not being unfairly targeted. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) indicated that this would be a flawed assumption, questioning whether Horowitz's inability to find evidence of bias really meant that there had not been any bias.\n\n\"Just because you didn\u2019t find it doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t exist,\" Paul said, noting that there could have been 15 people involved whose bias influenced their decisions, but it just wasn\u2019t provable.\n\n\"We could not prove it. We lay out here what we can,\" Horowitz replied.\n\nDuring his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, Horowitz also stated that as far as political bias is concerned, while the launch of the Russia probe itself appeared to be in line with FBI policy, the issue \"gets murkier\" when it comes to the FISA process.\n\nFISC Judge Rosemary Collyer used strong language in her four-page order. \"The FBI's handling of the Carter Page applications, as portrayed in the [Office of Inspector General] report, was antithetical to the heightened duty of candor described above,\" Collyer wrote. \"The frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable.\"\n\nThe homeland security committee's leaders each took a step back and offered a big-picture take on Horowitz's findings. \"I would argue that based on what the report reveals about early knowledge within the FBI, we should be asking a more fundamental question,\" said Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). \"At what point should the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign have been shut down?\"\n\nRanking member Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) asserted that the most significant information to come out of Horowitz's work has to do with past and present threats to the country. \"The most important fact that we should take away from this report and this hearing is that Russia, a foreign adversary, engaged in a sweeping and systematic effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that the FBI was right in investigating those who may have been involved,\" Peters said.\n\nHorowitz's report also described how the FBI relied on information gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele as part of opposition research for Fusion GPS on behalf of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Steele's information helped lead officials to approve seeking a FISA warrant for Page, even though the information had not been vetted as required by FBI policy.",
    " Title: Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld Challenges Donald Trump for 2020 Republican Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has become the first Republican to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Weld, 73, released a campaign video contrasting his political style with the current president's. However, he faces an uphill battle to take over a Republican party that has been reshaped in Trump's image.\n\nWeld served as governor of Massachusetts from 1991-97 and was part of President Ronald Reagan's administration in the Department of Justice. He was the running mate on the Libertarian ticket during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN, Weld stated, \"I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years, that would be a political tragedy.\" He added, \"So I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run.\"\n\nWeld's campaign video emphasizes his cross-party credentials as a Republican who was elected in the Democratic stronghold of Massachusetts. The three-minute production contrasts his record with clips of provocative statements by Trump. The video concludes with the slogan, \"A Better America Starts Here.\"\n\nDespite Weld's efforts, party leaders have already rejected his campaign. The Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, \"Any effort to challenge the president's nomination is bound to go absolutely nowhere.\" According to the most recent Gallup poll, 89% of Republican voters approve of the president.\n\nTrump's campaign reportedly raised more than $30 million in the first quarter of this year, significantly outpacing the political war chests of individual Democratic candidates. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was bested by Trump during the 2016 election, has recently been calling for a Republican to oust the president next year. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan have also been mentioned as potential party challengers to Trump.\n\nNext year, both Republican and Democratic voters will hold primaries to pick their respective party's standard bearer for the November 2020 presidential election. Sitting presidents do not usually face internal challengers, and only a few have ever been denied renomination by their party.\n\nIn addition to Weld, Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg has also joined the race to prevent Trump from being re-elected. As the election approaches, it remains to be seen who else will join the race to become the next president.",
    " Title: Texas Governor Rick Perry Indicted, Hires High-Powered Legal Team\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry will be booked at the Travis County criminal courthouse in Austin today, according to his lawyer, Tony Buzbee. Perry is facing charges of public corruption, following an indictment by a grand jury last week. Perry's defense lawyers have rejected the indictment as an attempt to criminalize politics and damage his prospects as a potential presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nPerry's legal team includes high-profile attorneys with notable records in significant cases. BP is among the clients represented by one of Perry's attorneys following the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Another attorney argued before the U.S. Supreme Court and won changes to campaign finance laws. George W. Bush's former lawyer during the Florida recount that decided the 2000 presidential election is also part of Perry's defense team. An Austin attorney, who has been paid at least $80,000 in taxpayer money since the grand jury was first seated in April, is also on the team.\n\nThe exact payment sources for the lawyers, whether state funds or other defense funds, have not been clarified yet, according to Tony Buzbee. Perry did not attend Monday's unveiling of his new all-star defense team at an upscale Austin hotel.\n\nPerry became the first Texas governor since 1917 to be indicted on Friday. He is facing charges of coercion and official oppression that carry a maximum sentence of 109 years in prison for carrying out a threat to veto funding for the state's public integrity unit last summer. The governor has emphatically stood by his veto and denied all wrongdoing.\n\nA summons has been issued for Perry to be arraigned on Friday, though the case may be waived by Perry altogether. Perry spokesman Felix Browne stated that the governor would not need to appear personally.\n\nPerry's indictment stems from a threat to veto $7.5 million in funding for the state's public integrity unit after Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, refused to resign following a drunken driving arrest. The ethics unit is housed under Lehmberg's office.\n\nNo one disputes that Perry has the power to veto measures approved by the Legislature, but his threat to do so before actually carrying it out prompted a complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group. The grand jury met for months before handing down its indictment, and Perry's $450-per-hour defense attorney, David L. Botsford, was paid using state funds.\n\nAides said the case would not prevent Perry from maintaining his packed upcoming schedule, which includes visits to the key presidential battleground states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina in the next two weeks. Perry also has a Thursday speech on immigration at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.",
    " Title: White House Clarifies Alterations in Benghazi Talking Points, Senate to Investigate\n\nArticle:\n\nReports from Friday suggested that the intelligence community had initially determined the likelihood of terrorist involvement in the 2012 Benghazi attack, but this information was allegedly omitted from the final talking points circulated by the Obama administration. However, on Saturday, the White House disputed this claim, stating that they made only minor adjustments to the talking points used to prepare Susan Rice for her Sunday talk show appearances.\n\nAccording to the Weekly Standard, the White House's statement clarified that the only edit made to the talking points was the change of \"consulate\" to \"diplomatic facility\" since the Benghazi facility was not formally a consulate. The White House emphasized that they worked off the points provided by the intelligence community.\n\nSenator John McCain, on CBS's Face the Nation, criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, suggesting that the president may have misled the American public to support the narrative of diminishing al-Qaeda influence in the Middle East. On the other hand, Chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Dianne Feinstein expressed confidence that high-ups in the White House were not behind the alleged disconnect between intelligence and talking points. Feinstein stated that Congress still plans to investigate the matter to determine where the disconnect occurred. The New York Times reported that it is evident that someone somewhere made a significant error in the process.",
    " Title: Increased Reports of Violent Attacks Invoking President Trump's Name\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of violent attacks on individuals, some of whom were mentally disabled, in various parts of the United States have been reported, with the common thread being the assailants' apparent hatred towards President Donald Trump. While the victims' political affiliations are not always clear, the attacks have been linked to Trump's election.\n\nIn one incident in Chicago, a man was bound, gagged, and beaten while his captors reportedly yelled racial and anti-Trump slurs. Another incident, captured on video in November, began as a minor car accident. The victim, in an interview with The Chicago Tribune, stated that when he asked someone from the other car if they had insurance, a group of men began beating him. The attack was recorded, and some of the attackers were heard saying phrases such as \"You voted Trump?\" and \"Don't vote Trump!\"\n\nIn another incident, a 15-year-old student at a Maryland high school was beaten up by several people while wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat during a student walkout to protest Trump's election.\n\nA New York City man was also attacked on the subway after a man asked him if he supported President-elect Trump. Corey Cataldo, the victim, told ABC7, \"The next thing I know, I have hands around my neck and I'm being choked. I try to fight him off, and another gentleman comes over, pretends like he's going to help me and says 'get off of him.' He shoves me up against the wall, up against the window.\"\n\nDuring an anti-Trump protest in Los Angeles, an activist told a CNN reporter, \"We can't just do rallies. We have to fight back. There will be casualties on both sides. People have to die.\" She added, \"People have to die.\"\n\nA survey also found that at least 2,000 educators around the country reported hearing racial slurs and other derogatory remarks being used against white students in the days immediately following Trump's victory, according to The New York Post.\n\nChicago, the site of both video-recorded attacks, was also the location of a March primary rally that Trump was forced to cancel due to security concerns after protesters and supporters clashed.\n\nWhile these incidents have drawn little media attention, far more press has been given to alleged crimes committed by supposed Trump supporters. In many cases, these have later turned out to be hoaxes.\n\nAmong the more notable incidents: In November, a black man in Mississippi was arrested for spray-painting his own church with a \"vote Trump\" tag and lighting the house of worship on fire. Muslim women in Louisiana and New York have also lied about assaults by alleged pro-Trump aggressors.",
    " Title: Constitutional Scholars Debate Legality of Obama's Airstrike Campaign Against ISIS in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nThe legality of President Barack Obama's sustained and targeted airstrike campaign against ISIS forces in Iraq has become a topic of debate among constitutional scholars. While there is agreement that short-term military operations are constitutionally acceptable, the prolonged nature of the current campaign has sparked discussions.\n\nAccording to Louis Fisher, a scholar at the Constitutional Law Project, a conflict lasting a few days could be justified, but President Obama's statement that the campaign could last for a year or more raises questions. Under the War Powers Act, Obama is required to report to Congress within 48 hours of the airstrikes commencing, and he has 60 days to gain Congress' approval or withdraw troops. He can extend this period by 30 days if the troops' lives would be endangered by an immediate withdrawal.\n\nThe president has yet to seek Congress' permission to continue the airstrikes, despite the prolonged nature of the campaign. The legal implications become more complex when the nature of the attacks is considered. Initially, airstrikes were deemed lawful due to their purpose of protecting American citizens. However, recent airstrikes are aimed at protecting the ethnic minority population in northern Iraq.\n\nPresident Obama has defended the airstrikes against ISIS near Mt. Sinjar as a \"humanitarian effort\" to prevent genocide. However, the legality of these airstrikes is questionable, as they are not aimed at defending Americans. According to Professor Peter Raven-Hansen, Obama may not have constitutional authority to use American forces in combat to defend foreigners.\n\nHowever, not all constitutional scholars agree on this point. Robert F. Turner, a national security professor at the University of Virginia, defends Obama's actions in Iraq. Turner argues that Obama can continue ordering airstrikes against ISIS because they are not a foreign state, but a terrorist group. Turner states, \"What he\u2019s doing, it\u2019s not an act of war. He\u2019s essentially coming to the defense of Iraq.\"\n\nRegardless of the legal interpretations, the president's pursuit of airstrike campaigns without Congress' approval, and against the advice of his top legal advisors, has raised concerns about executive overreach. If Obama continues this practice, even with well-intentioned actions, the cries of executive overreach are likely to grow louder.",
    " Title: Mario Lopez Apologizes for Comments on Transgender Children, Vows to \"Be More Informed and Thoughtful\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens, entertainment host Mario Lopez made comments about transgender children that sparked outrage. Lopez later called his comments \"ignorant and insensitive\" and pledged to \"be more informed and thoughtful.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Owens, who hosts her own show on the PragerU YouTube channel, discussed what she referred to as \"weird trends\" in Hollywood. She mentioned that celebrities, such as Charlize Theron, are revealing that their children are choosing their gender. Theron recently disclosed that her 7-year-old child Jackson does not identify as a boy.\n\nLopez agreed with Owens and expressed his own confusion about the issue. \"I'm blown away too,\" he said. \"I'm never one to tell anyone how to parent their children... if you come from a place of love, you can't go wrong.\" However, Lopez also stated that he finds it \"dangerous\" for parents to make a determination about their child's gender when they are young.\n\nOwens shared her own experiences, stating that as a child, she went through a \"tomboy\" phase before going through puberty. If she had decided to shave her head and become a boy at that time, she would have been depressed once she went through puberty and started liking boys, according to Owens.\n\nLopez agreed with this sentiment, stating, \"My daughter thinks some boys have cooties. You do not know anything about sexuality, you're just a kid.\"\n\nGender and sexuality are two separate aspects of a person's identity. Gender refers to a person's identity as male, female, a continuum or blend of both, or perhaps conforming to neither. Sex refers to a person's biological makeup, while sexual orientation is about who they are attracted to. Experts say transgender individuals do not \"choose\" their gender or sexuality.\n\nThroughout the discussion, the two hosts seemed to confuse gender and sexuality.\n\nOwens expressed her concern about the trend in Hollywood, stating, \"I think that's a very scary trend we're seeing in Hollywood right now, and to me, at the core of it, seems like narcissism.\" Lopez, a father of three, stated that parents need to let their kids be kids, but at the same time, they need to be the adults in the situation.\n\nLopez, who initially identified as politically independent during the interview, stated that he does not talk about politics because he is \"in the people business.\"\n\n\"I don't want to alienate anyone. I want everyone to want to watch me,\" Lopez said. However, his comments about transgender youth drew criticism from Twitter users, some of whom stated that he has been \"cancelled\" as far as they are concerned.\n\nIn a statement obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, Lopez apologized for his comments, stating, \"The comments I made were ignorant and insensitive, and I now have a deeper understanding of how hurtful they were. I have been and always will be an ardent supporter of the LGBTQ community, and I am going to use this opportunity to better educate myself. Moving forward, I will be more informed and thoughtful.\"\n\nThe LGBTQ organization PFLAG offered to provide Lopez with \"more education on what being # transgender means, the difference between # sexualorientation, # sex, and # gender... and a whole lot of other things.\" The group offers a guide to help loved ones understand these issues better.",
    " Title: Study Finds Google News Search Results Favor Left-Wing News Sources\n\nArticle:\n\nA report released by AllSides on Tuesday suggests that Google News' search results exhibit a bias towards left-wing news sources. The report, authored by John Gable, CEO of AllSides, attributes this bias to the general bias of popular websites online, rather than intentional manipulation by Google.\n\nAllSides, a group specializing in identifying media bias, based its findings on a media bias rating system that ranks media outlets as either left, right, or center. The group determines these ratings by surveying individuals about their own political bias and the bias of articles from various sites.\n\nThe study, which was conducted over 14 days from August 23 to September 5, 2018, analyzed the political bias of Google News and Google News search results. The results showed an overall bias of 65% left, 20% center, and 16% right in Google News.\n\nThe position of a link on a page is crucial, as the majority of traffic goes to the first links displayed on Google, with an estimated one-third going to the first result. The study found that the average position of the first result from left, center, or right sources differed significantly. The first result from left sources was, on average, one of the top two results, while the first result from right sources was below the fold, requiring users to scroll down before seeing their first news article from the right.\n\nAllSides' findings are consistent with past research and observations, as the group often finds it difficult to find perspectives from the right when using Google News. The report does not suggest intentional favoritism for media sources from the left, nor does it suggest the opposite. Instead, it demonstrates that the choice of links provided by Google News has a significant bias in favor of the left.\n\nThe full report, which includes detailed methodology and findings, is 39 pages long and can be found here. The report suggests that Google may be reflecting a bias rather than directing one.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce Debt Ceiling Bill, Sparking Constitutional Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have unveiled a new debt ceiling bill, marking the first legislative battle of President Obama's second term. The bill, set for a vote on Wednesday, allows the government to continue borrowing until May 18. The bill also includes a provision known as \"no budget, no pay,\" which has raised questions about its constitutionality.\n\nUnder the \"no budget, no pay\" provision, Congress would withhold the pay of lawmakers in either the House or the Senate if their chamber fails to pass a budget by April 15. The proposal is intended to pressure Senate Democrats to pass a budget, as the Senate has not passed one since Obama's first year in office.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the provision violates the 27th Amendment, which states that no law varying the compensation for senators and representatives shall take effect until an election of representatives has intervened. Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) stated that the 27th Amendment may not permit Congress to alter its pay in the midst of a current session.\n\nHouse Republican leadership defends the plan, stating that members would ultimately get paid, as they are constitutionally required to do. The plan would not violate the 27th Amendment, they suggest, because it would temporarily withhold pay, as opposed to reducing pay. Under the plan, members' pay would be held in escrow starting on April 15 for any chamber that has not passed a budget resolution.\n\nThe debt ceiling provision of the bill does not set a specific limit; instead, it would automatically increase the limit by the amount required to fund U.S. government obligations through May 18. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated that Obama would not block the bill if it passes.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have generally reacted coolly to the three-month extension, as it leaves other deadlines, such as sharp, across-the-board spending cuts and the possibility of a partial government shutdown, in place. However, failing to meet these deadlines would have less serious consequences than defaulting on U.S. obligations like payments to bondholders.\n\nObama has vowed he would not bargain over the debt limit. If the debt cap is not raised, the government would default on its obligations by as early as Feb. 15, according to the Treasury. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor confirmed that the House will vote on the package on Wednesday.\n\nThe debt-ceiling bill stands as the first legislative test of Obama's second term, following his public oath of office during the inaugural ceremony in Washington. The debt ceiling, the automatic spending cuts, and the expiration of the current budget are the immediate domestic challenges facing the administration and Congress. These issues also present opportunities to tackle the country's bloated deficit, though the president in his inaugural address pushed back on calls to cut entitlements.\n\nIn addition to addressing the debt ceiling, the president has other inaugural obligations to complete, including attending a prayer service and celebrating with campaign and White House staffers at inaugural balls. Tuesday is expected to be a normal working day at the White House, with the president meeting with top aides and press secretary Jay Carney briefing the press.\n\nBehind the scenes, Obama and his advisers are working on plans to unveil a comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, which is expected to be a central topic in Obama's Feb. 12 State of the Union address. The president is also seeking support from a wary Congress for the far-reaching package of gun control proposals he unveiled last week, including an assault weapons ban and universal background checks for gun purchasers.",

Jeff Sessions, the former federal prosecutor and Alabama attorney general, will defend his reputation against accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, as he seeks confirmation to become the Attorney General of the United States. In his prepared opening remarks, Sessions plans to emphasize his lifetime commitment to law and order, and his understanding of the historical impact of discrimination and the denial of voting rights on African-Americans.\n\nSessions is the first of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees to face a Senate confirmation hearing, and he is one of the most controversial nominees. He is the chief target of liberal groups hoping to derail Trump's agenda, with activists for civil rights, gay rights, illegal immigrants, and marijuana legalization pressuring Senate Democrats to oppose him.\n\nThe chief complaint about Sessions has been over race, stemming from accusations that as U.S. attorney in Alabama in the 1980s he improperly prosecuted black voting rights activists and made racially insensitive comments. He is accused of joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was OK until he learned its members smoked marijuana.\n\nIn 1986, the same accusations derailed his nomination for the federal bench when he was also grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sessions has vehemently denied making racially insensitive statements or holding racist views. He has pledged to uphold the law fairly and equitably. However, his critics are far from satisfied.\n\nIn his opening statement, Sessions will emphasize his long-standing relationship with his Senate colleagues and his commitment to the rule of law. He will outline goals for battling gun crimes, illegal immigration, drug-trafficking cartels, and other criminal gangs. He also will pledge to protect voting rights, support local law enforcement agencies, and build mutual respect between police and minority communities.\n\nSessions will insist that his lifetime commitment to law and order includes the protection of the rights of every American. He understands the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community, and he understands the lifelong scars born by women who are victims of assault and abuse.\n\nIf confirmed, Sessions has pledged to be worthy of the office and the special trust that comes with it. He is ready for the job and will do it right, he says.",
    " Title: Senate Approves Landmark Bill to Ban Workplace Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Senate on Thursday approved a bill, known as the Employer Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), to ban workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The final vote was 64-32, with 54 Democrats and 10 Republicans supporting the legislation.\n\nThe bill, which applies to work sites with more than 15 people, exempts religious organizations and the U.S. military. The legislation is intended to ensure that all citizens, regardless of where they live, can work without fear of discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe ENDA has been introduced in nearly every Congress since 1994. It came one vote shy of passage in 1996, but had not been given a full Senate vote since. Existing federal laws ban employer discrimination based on race, color, sex, nationality, religion, age, and disability.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House, however, is not scheduled to vote on the bill. Speaker John Boehner's office stated that he does not plan to allow a vote, citing concerns that the legislation will cost small-business jobs and increase \"frivolous\" litigation. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's office also stated that there is no vote scheduled.\n\nIn a statement, President Obama urged House leaders to bring the bill up for a vote. \"One party in one house of Congress should not stand in the way of millions of Americans who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do,\" he said.\n\nOpponents argue that the legislation is unnecessary because most private businesses, including the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies, have self-adopted policies that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Twenty-two states and Washington, D.C. have already enacted laws prohibiting such discrimination. A June 2013 Pew Research survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adults reported that 21% of respondents said they have been treated unfairly at work because of their sexual orientation.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Approves Budget Reconciliation Legislation to Repeal Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has passed legislation that allows Republicans to proceed with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure, which passed in the House 227-198, will now move to the Senate for approval.\n\nThe legislation, if passed, will enable Republicans to use a procedure known as \"budget reconciliation\" to dismantle key provisions of the healthcare law. The move comes amid concerns about the replacement of the law, as Republican leaders have expressed their intention to \"repeal\" and \"replace\" Obamacare simultaneously to avoid disruptions in healthcare coverage. However, they have yet to agree on a replacement plan.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin hailed the move as a \"critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law.\" In a rare floor speech, Ryan stated, \"This is a critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law.\"\n\nDemocrats, who are united in their opposition to the repeal, have criticized the move, with House minority leader Nancy Pelosi of California stating, \"For six years they have had a chance to propose an alternative. We see nothing.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, covers an estimated 20 million Americans. Republicans have been trying to repeal the law since its passage. With both chambers of Congress and the White House now in Republican control, they finally have the opportunity to do so.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, who campaigned on the promise of repealing the law on \"day one\" and replacing it with \"something terrific,\" has offered few details about his proposal. During a CNN town hall meeting, House Speaker Ryan stated that Congress would draft a replacement plan \"definitely within these first 100 days\" of Trump's presidency.\n\nThe repeal process is only a first step. Lawmakers will now begin drafting the legislation to replace the bill, a lengthy and exhaustive process that will take place across four committees.\n\nIn a separate development, Congress also approved legislation that would allow retired Marine General James Mattis to become defense secretary, granting him an exemption from the law that bars former service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top job at the Pentagon. The measure is expected to be signed by President Obama before he leaves office next week.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments on Presidential Immunity and Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Tuesday, via teleconference, regarding the power to investigate the President of the United States. The case, which involves President Donald Trump's tax returns and other financial records, stems from New York City prosecutors' demand for these documents as part of a criminal investigation into the president's hush money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels, as well as the House of Representatives' investigation into potential conflicts of interest of a president who still owns a business.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that a president should not be subject to investigation while in office. \"We're asking for temporary presidential immunity,\" attorney Jay Sekulow said.\n\nAndrea Bernstein of \"Trump, Inc.\" and NYU law professor Melissa Murray listened to the oral arguments and discussed their observations with co-host Ilya Marritz. A few takeaways:\n\n1. Fights between the legislative and executive branches are not normally heard in front of the Supreme Court. Congress and the White House have typically negotiated solutions to such disputes. \"And the fact that we're in court is because this president hasn't acceded to those norms,\" Murray said.\n\n2. The phrase \"presidential harassment\" was repeatedly mentioned. This language, used frequently by Trump on Twitter and raised by his lawyers in court, has transformed what would be considered, in other times, ordinary and essential legislative oversight into what accounts to bullying, harassment, and mere partisan politics, according to Murray.\n\n3. A number of the justices, including the liberal Stephen Breyer, expressed sympathy for the White House's arguments against the House's demands for documents, but they were far more skeptical about the claim that the president is immune from even criminal investigation. \"The court seemed not to be amenable to that kind of argument at all,\" Murray said.\n\nThe justices are expected to deliver a decision in the cases\u2014Trump v. Mazars, Trump v. Deutsche Bank, and Trump v. Vance\u2014this summer.\n\nFor more updates on WNYC's ongoing investigations, sign up for email notifications from WNYC and \u2588\u2588\u2588.

    " Title: Right-wing Media's Denial of Racism: A Dangerous Fiction\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent controversial remarks from Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling have brought to light a recurring theme in right-wing media: the denial of the existence of racism in contemporary America. This perspective, which has also surfaced in recent Supreme Court decisions, provides a cover for modern racists and policies that negatively impact minorities.\n\nFox News personality Eric Bolling, among others, has asserted that there is no racism. This viewpoint, which has become commonplace within the conservative media sphere, is echoed by Fox contributor Charles Krauthammer, who argues that policies protecting against racial discrimination are no longer necessary because they are perceived as giving \"advantages to people who 50 years ago\" were disadvantaged. Co-host of Fox's The Five, Andrea Tantaros, has argued that civil rights laws are no longer needed \"because there is equality.\" Bill O'Reilly has stated that racism is \"an individual problem,\" \"not a country problem,\" and that America's history of discrimination is \"all in the past.\"\n\nThis willingness to ignore the existence of racism provides a cover for intolerance on the fringe. In the past month, right-wing media has propelled Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy to folk hero status for evading millions in federal taxes, only to distance themselves when he was caught on tape questioning the circumstances of black people's enslavement. Similarly, billionaire Donald Sterling, the owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, was banned for life from the NBA after his alleged racist comments to his mistress were exposed.\n\nWhile many Fox News hosts and contributors eventually condemned Bundy and Sterling's racism, the rhetoric is reminiscent of right-wing media's stereotypes of minorities and denial of the existence of racism. In the wake of their racist rants, both Bundy and Sterling denied they held any racist views.\n\nBundy and Sterling are extreme examples of cognitive dissonance, but the racism-denialist mindset is a pervasive and dangerous one. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Schuette v. BAMN, which effectively overturned decades of civil rights precedent and gutted a core component of equal protection law, is evidence of this.\n\nIn her dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote about a country where the Bundys and Sterlings still hold considerable sway. She went beyond the simple bigotry of the Bundys and Sterlings and found that more subtle wounds of racism still exist in this country. \"Race matters,\" she wrote, \"because of the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts: 'I do not belong here.'\"\n\nDecisions made and policies created on the premise that racism no longer exists in America have damaging impacts on civil rights and minority communities. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Michigan, which opened a door for state majorities to change their political systems to unfairly disadvantage minorities, is evidence of this. Such consequences are already being felt by minority students in Michigan, with a dramatic decrease in African-American student enrollment.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent disregard for history and legal precedent is reminiscent of the court's June 2013 blow to voting rights, a decision also made on the premise that racism no longer exists in America but in reality had a negative impact on minorities. In the June 25 decision, the conservative majority invalidated the provision within the Voting Rights Act that prevents states and local jurisdictions from enacting racially discriminatory election practices. States wasted no time after the Supreme Court's gutting of the Voting Rights Act pushing highly restrictive voting laws that history has shown serve to make it harder for minorities to cast a vote.\n\nApparently, within the conservative bubble, it's easy to praise such devastating policies so long as you deny the existence of racism at all, a refrain that ultimately helps keep discrimination alive.",
    " Title: Neil Gorsuch's Judicial Philosophy and Speech at Case Western University School of Law\n\nArticle:\n\nNeil Gorsuch, a justice on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, delivered a lecture at Case Western University School of Law in 2016, where he discussed the need for reform of the civil justice system. However, the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia led Gorsuch to shift the focus of his speech to the legacy of Scalia.\n\nIn his speech, titled \"Of Lions and Bears, Judges and Legislators, and the Legacy of Justice Scalia,\" Gorsuch outlined his and Scalia's shared judicial philosophy. He emphasized that judges should apply the law as it is, focusing on text, structure, and history to determine the law's meaning at the time of the events in question. Gorsuch argued against deciding cases based on personal moral convictions or policy considerations.\n\nGorsuch stated that judges should use traditional tools of interpretation to determine the law, rather than shaping the law according to their political views. He also highlighted the importance of impartiality, stating that judges should regularly issue judgments with which they may disagree, as they believe that is what the law demands.\n\nGorsuch expressed his belief that the traditional account of the judicial role, which Scalia defended, will endure. He acknowledged the criticism and temptations to join the critics but remained optimistic about the enduring nature of this judicial philosophy.\n\nIn a separate context, Neil Gorsuch is a federal judge nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as an associate justice on the Supreme Court. His nomination and confirmation have been a topic of debate, with some supporting and others opposing his appointment. Further information about Gorsuch's background, case for, and arguments against his nomination can be found in other articles.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Begins Process to Dismantle Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives initiated the process of dismantling the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) on Friday, approving a budget resolution on a largely party-line vote. The Senate passed the measure earlier in the week. This resolution allows Republicans in Congress to use a process known as \"budget reconciliation\" to roll back significant parts of the health care law.\n\nNine Republicans crossed party lines to vote against the measure, including Reps. Justin Amash, Charlie Dent, Brian Fitzpatrick, Walter Jones, John Katko, Raul Labrador, Tom MacArthur, Thomas Massie, and Tom McClintock. No Democrats voted for the resolution.\n\nRepresentative Dent, a Pennsylvania moderate, expressed concerns about the lack of a clear plan to replace Obamacare, stating, \"If there's uncertainty and these markets are already collapsing without us doing anything, this type of action could accelerate the collapse. So we have to make sure we have a clear idea of how we're going to land this plane.\"\n\nRepresentative MacArthur of New Jersey stated, \"I couldn't vote because I think we're going a little too fast.\" However, he added, \"That said, I understand Leadership's goals, and I agree with them. We have to fix what is clearly broken with Obamacare. We have to fix that. I have for years said we have to repeal and replace.\"\n\nAmash, a Michigan Republican, opposed the measure due to broader concerns about government spending. The vote also approved budget guidelines for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe focus of the debate is primarily on Obamacare, which is expected to dominate much of the time in Washington in the coming months. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise stated, \"This is a signal that we are very serious about what we've campaigned on for years. It's the very beginning.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan compared the current situation to the debate in 2010, stating, \"My colleagues, this experiment has failed. This law is collapsing as we speak. And we have to step in before things get even worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission.\"\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who led the passage of the law in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats controlled the House, accused Republicans of attempting to \"cut and run\" on people with health insurance and argued that Republicans would end up cutting Medicare benefits as well.\n\nBy using the budget process, Republicans are taking advantage of the same process Democrats used seven years ago to pass the law, using a special budgeting rule that allows them to skirt a filibuster in the Senate. However, this strategy only works for fiscal measures in the healthcare law, like tax credits, and leaves untouched some of the more popular slices of the law, such as allowing children to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26.\n\nThe vote will clear the decks for Republicans to begin working on a repeal of the law, but the larger debate has engulfed the Capitol over how and when Republicans would replace the law. The debate over replacement has exposed some rifts within the Republican Party, which now controls the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nCompeting plans to replace Obamacare exist, and No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn has indicated that the party may opt to move smaller pieces of legislation as opposed to one overarching replacement. Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper at a town hall that the goal is to move everything at once. \"We want to do this at the same time, and in some cases in the same bill,\" Ryan said. \"So we want to advance repealing this law with its replacement at the same time.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Fundraising Outpaces Incumbent President Trump in 2020 Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe seventh Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season took place on January 14, 2020, at Drake University campus in Des Moines, Iowa. In a notable distinction, President Donald Trump's reelection bid has been outraised by the Democratic presidential candidates in 2019, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings and campaign statements.\n\nNo incumbent president this century has been so thoroughly outraised by a field of challengers in the year before a reelection contest. In 2012, the main Republican challengers to President Barack Obama in 2012 barely took in more than the incumbent in 2011. President George W. Bush narrowly topped his challengers in fundraising in 2003, the year before he won reelection in 2004.\n\nSarah Bryner, director of research and strategy at the Center for Responsive Politics, stated, \"The field is trouncing Trump in fundraising, and that is unprecedented.\" Bryner attributed this cash edge to a Democratic voter base energized and motivated since Trump's 2016 election. She added that the pace of donations could reflect a dislike of Trump more than a fondness for any particular candidates, though Democratic contender and prolific fundraiser Sen. Bernie Sanders has a famously devoted following.\n\nTrump still had a fundraising advantage over any of his potential challengers entering 2020. His campaign reported raising $46 million in the fourth quarter, higher than Sanders' $34.5 million, the biggest haul in the Democratic field. The Trump campaign had more than $100 million in the bank at the end of 2019, while most Democratic campaigns will not announce cash on hand numbers until the end of the month.\n\nThe following table and visualization list the fundraising figures for Trump, his two predecessors, and their challengers in the year prior to their reelection bids, with total receipts (which include transfers from other campaign committees) and contributions from individuals listed separately.\n\n| Year | Incumbent President | Total Receipts | Contributions from Individuals |\n|------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2019 | Donald Trump        | $143.1M       | $125.5M                         |\n| 2011 | Barack Obama        | $75.0M        | $60.2M                         |\n| 2003 | George W.

    " Title: Six Democratic Presidential Candidates Face Off in Iowa Debate as Tensions Rise\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first Democratic presidential debate of 2020 took place in Des Moines on Tuesday night, less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses. The event, hosted by CNN, featured a slim cast of six hopefuls: Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden; Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana; and billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nThe debate comes amidst a growing rift between Senators Sanders and Warren, who are both vying for the progressive vote. Nate Ashworth, editor of Election Central, wrote that the election is now underway, and the Democratic hopefuls are foes and rivals, not friends.\n\nThe Washington Post declared that the debate was a \"battle for heads, not hearts.\" The Los Angeles Times advised that \"uncertainty reigns\" in the run-up to the debate.\n\nIn other news, Texas Governor Greg Abbott presented the Governor's Medal of Courage, the Lone Star State's highest civilian award, to Jack Wilson. Wilson, a former reserve deputy sheriff, took out a shooter who opened fire in a Fort Worth church in late December, killing two members of the church. Wilson, 71, heads up the church's volunteer security squad.\n\nPresident Trump will hold another rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday. The rally, which takes place in the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena, has caused controversy among students, leading Chancellor Mark Mone to explain that the campus has naming rights for the venue but does not own or control the site.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll of 6,878 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 16-29 and released Friday found that 66% of U.S. adults say the federal government should have \"a lot of responsibility\" in reducing economic inequality in the U.S. Other findings include:\n\n- 62% overall say large business and corporations should have responsibility\n- 52% overall say state governments should have responsibility\n- 46% overall say wealthy individuals should have responsibility\n- 13% overall say churches and religious organizations have the responsibility\n\nThe poll also found that 44% of Republicans and 75% of Democrats agree that the federal government should have a lot of responsibility in reducing economic inequality. The poll did not provide specific numbers for other demographics.",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses Baltimore Riots: Six Points on Ongoing Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprise move during a scheduled news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday, President Barack Obama addressed the ongoing Baltimore riots, offering six points on the issue that he had carefully outlined in notes ahead of the conference. The focus of the meeting was originally intended to be on trade and the formalities of a state visit.\n\nThe president's six points essentially boiled down to one main point: \"This has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on a long time.\"\n\nObama expressed concern that sending police to contain the situation would not solve the problem, stating, \"If we think that we\u2019re just going to send police to do the dirty work of containment, we\u2019re not going to solve this problem.\" He apologized to Prime Minister Abe for deviating from the intended topic, acknowledging that the issue was essentially irrelevant to the Japanese relationship.\n\nThe president has historically been criticized for his comments on race, and he has felt that his previous remarks have been misconstrued. In 2009, he was criticized for stating that the police acted \"stupidly\" in arresting Henry Louis Gates, which led to a \"beer summit\" to calm tensions. In 2012, his comments about Trayvon Martin, \"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,\" sparked controversy. Last year, during the Ferguson unrest, he was criticized for appearing too deferential to the police and not showing enough anger, while he was on vacation instead of joining the marches.\n\nWhite House aides stated that Obama's lengthy, deliberative response was not intended to initiate a long, end-of-term conversation about race in America. Despite becoming more comfortable discussing race over his time in office, the president's views on the subject have not significantly changed. His six points were an attempt to express his current thoughts on the issue while navigating the other challenges he has faced over the years.\n\nIn his address, Obama expressed sympathy for the family of Freddie Gray, avoiding assigning blame or making any statements that could interfere with the Justice Department's investigation into Gray's death while in police custody. He also expressed sympathy for the police officers injured in the riots and their families. The president condemned the rioters' violence, stating that they were not protesting or making a statement, but stealing.\n\nObama emphasized that focusing solely on the violence distracts from both the peaceful protests and the efforts to defuse the violence. He argued that he has taken action, having established a task force on policing and working with local communities to implement police reforms.\n\nThe president acknowledged the difficulty in federalizing every police force and forcing them to undergo retraining. However, he stated that he could collaborate with them to facilitate change within their departments.\n\nIn his sixth and final point, Obama called for national introspection, stating that people, not just those with sons who resemble Trayvon Martin, need to take responsibility for the children suffering in disadvantaged communities, many of whom are black. He emphasized that if the country truly wanted to solve the problem, it could, but only if it considered those children as its own and prioritized their well-being.\n\nThe president will continue to discuss race and inequality, but in the context of other priorities, such as criminal justice reform, job training, early childhood education, and his mentoring program for black youth called \"My Brother's Keeper.\" However, without congressional funding or local leadership, these initiatives may not make significant progress.\n\n\"What I\u2019ve tried to do is to promote those ideas that would make a difference,\" Obama concluded. \"But I think we all understand that the politics of that are tough because it\u2019s easy to ignore those problems or to treat them just as a law-and-order issue, as opposed to a broader social issue.\"",
    " Title: Key Questions Arise Over Bergdahl-Taliban Prisoner Swap\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent prisoner swap between the United States and the Taliban, which resulted in the release of long-missing Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, has sparked a wave of criticism from lawmakers who have labeled the move as both reckless and lawless. The White House is now facing questions about the decision, including why Congress was not informed of the deal beforehand, as federal law requires, and what went into the administration's media strategy.\n\nPresident Barack Obama defended his administration's efforts to rescue Bergdahl from captivity during a speech in Warsaw on Tuesday. He stated, \"Regardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he's held in captivity. Period. Full stop. We don't condition that.\"\n\nHowever, the president's arguments are unlikely to quell the questions. Concerns include the potential precedent the deal could set for other individuals in U.S. custody and American service members who might be captured in the future. The future of Sgt. Bergdahl remains uncertain.\n\nHere are some key questions about the Bergdahl-Taliban trade:\n\n1. Did the administration comply with the 30-day notification requirement for transferring prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay? Over the weekend, it appeared that the administration had not complied with the legislation requiring the president to give Congress 30 days' notice before transferring prisoners. However, the formal notification did not take place until Monday, according to congressional officials.\n\n2. What was the administration's media strategy regarding the Bergdahl case? The administration's media strategy, including comments made by National Security Adviser Susan Rice on a Sunday morning talk show, is under fresh scrutiny.\n\n3. What was the rationale for the president's decision to act without Congressional notification? The White House has stated that they had earlier briefed Congress on the outlines of a possible swap.\n\n4. What is the health status of Sgt. Bergdahl? Some Republicans have questioned whether Bergdahl was in grave health, as administration officials claimed was the reason for not abiding by the 30-day notification requirement.\n\n5. How does the Bergdahl-Taliban trade compare to the Benghazi controversy? Some Republicans see the prisoner swap as a reflection of what is wrong with President Obama's leadership, particularly his tendency to negotiate with foreign actors and disregard the rule of law.\n\nThe prisoner swap is becoming a significant point of contention, particularly within conservative circles, and may have lasting implications for U.S. policy regarding the treatment and release of detainees.",
    " Title: Celebrity Anti-Semitic Remarks and the Apatholypse: A Threat to Social Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent incidents of anti-Semitic comments from sports and entertainment celebrities have raised concerns about the future of the Black Lives Matter movement and the overall state of social justice. The muted response to these incidents is troubling, as one might expect a more passionate public outcry given the current climate of \"New Woke-fulness\" in Hollywood and the sports world.\n\nIn June, rapper and actor Ice Cube posted a series of tweets that implied Jews were responsible for the oppression of blacks. NFL player DeSean Jackson shared several anti-Semitic messages, including a quote incorrectly attributed to Hitler, stating that Jews had a plan to \"extort America\" and achieve \"world domination.\" NBA player Stephen Jackson, a self-proclaimed activist, agreed with DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic comments and expressed support for Louis Farrakhan, a notorious homophobe and anti-Semite.\n\nPerformer Chelsea Handler, who is Jewish, posted videos of Farrakhan to her 3.9 million followers. This means nearly 4 million people received a subliminal message that some Jews support anti-Semitism.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's reelection campaign has also been criticized for exploiting anti-Jewish biases, despite the fact that Trump's son-in-law and campaign advisor Jared Kushner is Jewish and his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism before they married. The campaign issued a letter accusing three billionaires of Jewish descent of using their fortunes to \"rig the November election.\"\n\nThese incidents share the same scapegoat logic as oppressive groups throughout history, blaming a minority group for societal problems. It is disheartening to see people from marginalized groups perpetuating this kind of prejudice without realizing that it perpetuates racism.\n\nSome of the celebrities involved have apologized, while others continue to defend their comments. Their responses have confirmed people's worst opinions rather than dissuading them. In a CNN interview, Stephen Jackson was angry and belligerent when called out for his comments, stating, \"I stated I could have changed my words. There's nothing that I said that I support any of that. There's nothing I said that I hate anybody.\"\n\nIn 2013, there were 751 reported hate crimes against Jews, but by 2019, the number had nearly tripled to 2,107. In the same year, a gunman in San Diego entered a synagogue and murdered one person while wounding three.\n\nThe song \"Strange Fruit,\" written by a white, Jewish high school teacher, Abel Meeropol, and performed by Billie Holiday, is a powerful example of the struggle against racism. The song, which was first recorded in 1939, met strong resistance from radio stations afraid of its graphic lyrics about lynching, but it went on to sell a million copies that year and became Holiday's best-selling record ever.\n\nThe lesson never changes: No one is free until everyone is free. As Martin Luther King Jr. explained, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality.\" Let's act like it. If we're going to be outraged by injustice, let's be outraged by injustice against anyone.",
    " Title: Obama: Individuals Responsible for VA Record Manipulation to be Held Accountable\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has stated that anyone found to have manipulated or falsified Veterans Affairs (VA) records will be held accountable. The president's comments were made during a meeting with White House deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors, who has been detailed to work with the VA since last week.\n\nSpeaking about reports of long wait times and efforts to cover up delays, Obama described the behavior as \"dishonorable\" and \"disgraceful\" if proven true. He emphasized that he will not tolerate such actions and neither should anyone else.\n\nThe president mentioned that Nabors is currently investigating reports of misleading statistics about veteran care at a facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Obama mentioned accountability several times in his prepared remarks, noting that some employees had already been placed on administrative leave.\n\nObama also addressed the challenges faced by the VA, citing an influx of new veterans from recent U.S. military conflicts and an aging population of Baby Boomer veterans. He stated that there are 85 million appointments scheduled over a year.\n\nThe president defended Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki, stating, \"No one cares more about our veterans.\" However, he added that he expects accountability and improvement in the full report on the VA's problems.\n\nEarlier this month, Shinseki told NPR's Robert Siegel that he would take swift and appropriate action if reports that the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system kept two lists of veterans waiting for care \u2013 one for sharing with Washington and another showing wait times that sometimes reached beyond a year \u2013 were substantiated.\n\nThe VA is currently the subject of two main inquiries: an inspector general investigation of hospitals accused of fudging their reported statistics, and a broader audit ordered by Shinseki of all VA health centers. The findings of both inquiries are expected to be released this summer.",
    " Title: Obama Addresses Race in America: A National Conversation on Race and the Trayvon Martin Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the George Zimmerman acquittal in the killing of Trayvon Martin, a national conversation on race has been a prominent topic in the United States. Simon, a political columnist, expresses relief that the conversation has come to an end, stating that it was a draining and exhausting experience that lasted for more than a week.\n\nThe president, Barack Obama, spoke movingly and personally about race in an unexpected appearance in the White House briefing room on Friday. Obama stated that the African-American community is looking at the issue of race through a set of experiences and a history that \"doesn't go away.\"\n\nObama's most quoted line was \"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\" He went on to discuss the pain felt by the African-American community and the experiences of racial profiling and stereotypes that many African-Americans face.\n\nObama expressed that politicians trying to organize conversations on race have not been productive, and instead, suggested that deep, serious, and difficult discussions should take place in families, churches, and workplaces. He encouraged people to ask themselves if they are wringing as much bias out of themselves as they can and judging people based on the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.\n\nThe president has already moved on to other topics, with a White House release announcing that he will spend the week delivering a series of speeches on rebuilding an economy that puts the middle class and those fighting to join it front and center.\n\nRoger Simon, the author of the article, expresses his agreement with Obama's suggestion for deep and serious discussions on race, but notes that such conversations are unlikely to take place on a national scale. Simon is the chief political columnist for \u2588\u2588\u2588 and the author of the e-book \"RECKONING: Campaign 2012 and the Fight for the Soul of America.\"",
    " Title: APA Survey Reveals Rising Stress Levels Among Americans Over Election, Health Care, and Mass Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) has released its annual \"Stress in America\" survey, revealing that sociocultural issues, including the 2020 presidential election, access to health care, and mass shootings, are causing the most stress for American citizens. The survey, conducted between August 1 and September 3, polled 3,617 adults across the U.S.\n\nThe survey indicates that while overall stress levels have not significantly changed over the past few years, the proportion of Americans who find specific issues stressful has risen over the past year.\n\nThe 2020 election is already a significant stressor for 56% of adults, a year before Election Day. This is an increase from the 52% who found the 2016 presidential election stressful. The election is proving to be a more stressful topic for survey respondents identifying as Democrats, versus those identifying as Republicans, by almost 25%.\n\nThe survey also cites 69% of adults pointing to health care, specifically the costs thereof, as a notable point of stress. Additionally, 71% of adults cited mass shootings as stressful, making it the most common source of stress among those surveyed, with a rise of almost 10% from the APA's 2018 survey.\n\nOther stressful topics cited include climate change, immigration, national security, and abortion. The presence of these \"hot-button\" issues in the news cycle is likely not a coincidence, the APA found. In 2019, 54% of those surveyed said they \"want to stay informed,\" but that the news is stressful. 39% of respondents said they have \"taken steps over the past year to reduce their news consumption.\"\n\nThe impact of discrimination was also deemed stressful by a majority of survey respondents identifying as part of a minority community. 63% of people of color surveyed said that discrimination has kept them from having a fully productive life. 64% of LGBT adults surveyed said the same thing.\n\nStress levels as a whole decreased drastically across respondents categorized by age group, the survey found. Members of the baby boomer generation and \"older adults\" were found to have significantly lower average stress levels, and their younger Gen X, Gen Z, and millennial peers.\n\nArthur C. Evans Jr., APA's chief executive officer, said in a statement accompanying the survey's release, \"There is a lot of uncertainty in our world right now. While [there] are important societal issues that need to be addressed, the results also reinforce the need to have more open conversations about the impact of stress and stress management, especially with groups that are experiencing high levels of stress.\"\n\nThe survey found that 59% of those surveyed felt they had not received enough emotional support to mitigate their stress levels. Research shows that prolonged feelings of anxiety and stress can affect overall physical and mental health, Evans noted.\n\nAccording to the APA, the best ways to manage stress are to get a good amount of sleep every night, exercise regularly, and maintain a healthy network of social support.",

Most major U.S. equity benchmarks were up in light pre-Thanksgiving trading, although they gave back some ground in the afternoon to finish near session lows.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat, while the small-capitalization Russell 2000 Index climbed 1.3 percent to pace the gains. The Nasdaq 100 Index wiped out nearly half of its decline from Tuesday. Energy was the strongest group in the S&P 500 Index, as WTI crude rebounded from a one-year low to leap back above $54 a barrel.\n\nApple Inc. surrendered an earlier gain to close down for a third straight day, bringing its loss this week to 8.6 percent. Foot Locker Inc. jumped 15 percent, the most since May, after posting strong third-quarter earnings. CBS Corp. rose amid speculation of a coming merger with Viacom Inc., which also saw its stock climb. Gap Inc. added almost 5 percent despite reporting weak earnings as investors appeared to finally buy the dip on a company that had lost almost 10 percent this month.\n\nThe dollar weakened after MNI reported the Fed is considering ending a cycle of interest rate hikes as early as the spring. In addition, U.S. data showed that durable goods orders declined, and filings for unemployment benefits rose.\n\nBanks and telecommunications companies led an advance in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index as optimism for a compromise on Italy's budget buoyed stocks. The euro gained and Italian bonds firmed on reports the Italian government may be open to budget revisions as the European Union took a first step toward imposing fines on the country.\n\nElsewhere, emerging-market shares climbed, and an index tracking developing-nation currencies reached the highest since August. Bitcoin advanced after a recent sell-off. It's a shortened trading week because of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. In addition, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, marks the traditional start to the U.S. holiday shopping season.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to 2,649.93, and the Nasdaq 100 gained 0.8 percent. The Japanese yen declined 0.3 percent to 113.07 per dollar. The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index rose 0.1 percent to the highest since August. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.0609 percent. Germany's 10-year yield climbed three basis points to 0.376 percent. Britain's 10-year yield added one basis point to 1.396 percent. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 2 percent to $54.48 a barrel, the largest gain in seven weeks.",
    " Title: President Obama Praises Ongoing National Dialogue on Race Relations as Healthy for the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with National Public Radio (NPR), President Barack Obama expressed his belief that the ongoing national dialogue about race relations, particularly minority communities' interactions with law enforcement, is beneficial for the United States. He stated that the protests in cities such as New York and Ferguson, Missouri, are not evidence of increased racial tensions but rather a sign that the issue has come to the forefront, potentially leading to long-term solutions.\n\nThe president recorded the interview before departing for a two-week vacation in Hawaii. He asserted that the nation's racial divide has not worsened over the past six years, and the protests are a positive development that brings attention to the issue.\n\n\"I actually think that the issue has surfaced in a way that probably is healthy,\" Mr. Obama said. \"The issue of police and communities of color being mistrustful of each other is hardly new; that dates back a long time. It's just something that hasn't been talked about, and for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nThe president has addressed the issue multiple times in recent months, including after grand jury decisions in New York and Ferguson not to charge white police officers in connection with the deaths of black men. He also condemned violence after a gunman assassinated two NYPD officers, claiming he acted in retaliation against law enforcement for its treatment of the black community.\n\nOn a broader scale, the president stated that many white Americans have beliefs on racially tinged issues that stem not from racism but from a lack of information or social awareness. For example, he said white Americans may not understand that African-Americans statistically are more likely to be pulled over by police.\n\n\"If you'd asked whites in those jurisdictions \u2014 \u2018Do you think traffic stops were done fairly?\u2014 the majority of whites probably would say yes because it's not something they experience,\" Mr. Obama said. \"It's not because of racism. It's just that it's not something that they see.\"",

Cruz believes that if he earns a majority of delegates at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, he can continue to energize and unite Trump supporters for the November election.\n\nCruz highlighted his effectiveness in appealing to blue-collar workers, a key demographic within Trump's base, stating, \"The issues that energize and excite the Trump voters\u2014illegal immigration, securing the border, keeping this country safe, and bringing jobs back to America\u2014bringing them back from China, back from Mexico\u2014those issues are right at the heart of our campaign.\"\n\nTrump has predominantly won among voters who have not graduated from college, but Cruz won those voters in Wisconsin, the most recent primary. Trump has threatened \"riots\" and suggested his supporters will abandon the Republican Party en masse if he is denied the nomination at the July convention. Cruz acknowledged the potential for divisions within the party at a contested convention but emphasized the support he has received from other Republican candidates, such as Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Carly Fiorina.\n\nCruz also mentioned that his campaign is currently examining potential vice presidential nominees and pointed to the original GOP field as evidence of an \"abundance of good choices\" for the position. The socially conservative candidate declined to offer his opinion on Bruce Springsteen's decision to cancel a concert in North Carolina due to the state's controversial \"bathroom law.\" Cruz argued that both Springsteen and the people of North Carolina have free speech rights, and that the people of North Carolina are entitled to pass laws that reflect their values.\n\nThe full interview is set to air Friday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Bloomberg TV's With All Due Respect.",
    " Title: Georgia's Sixth Congressional District Special Election Results in a Runoff Between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel\n\nArticle:\n\nThe special election for Georgia's Sixth Congressional District has resulted in a runoff between upstart Democrat Jon Ossoff and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. The election, held on Tuesday, failed to produce an outright winner, as Ossoff garnered 48 percent of the vote, falling just short of the majority threshold required in the so-called \"jungle primary.\"\n\nHandel, the top GOP vote-getter, received 20 percent of the vote, comfortably ahead of technology executive Bob Gray, who received 11 percent, and former State Senators Judson Hill and Dan Moody, who each received 9 percent of the vote.\n\nIn a tweet late Tuesday, Gray expressed support for Handel, stating, \"We are going to rally around Karen Handel. We wish her Godspeed.\"\n\nThe winner of the runoff between Handel and Ossoff will succeed Tom Price, who resigned to become Trump's health and human services secretary.\n\nOssoff, a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, had sought to capitalize on opposition to President Donald Trump to secure an outright victory that would have emboldened Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. His campaign attracted more than $8 million in donations, most of which came from outside the state.\n\nRepublicans nationally and in Georgia acknowledged before polls opened that Ossoff would likely top the slate of 11 Republicans, five Democrats, and two independents who appeared together on one primary ballot. Earlier Tuesday, the GOP criticized Ossoff for living outside the district and portrayed him as a conservative's nightmare who would increase taxes and take away guns.\n\nThe Republican National Committee issued a statement, saying, \"These liberal Democrats failed to inspire voters with a candidate who couldn\u2019t even vote for himself, received 97 percent of his donations from outside the district, and consistently lied about his own weak resume.\"\n\nOssoff acknowledged Tuesday that he lives just south of the district, in Atlanta, so that his girlfriend is close to her work at Emory University's medical complex.\n\nRepublican groups ran a blitz of ads trying to tie Ossoff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has spent more than $2 million on these and other attacks.\n\nTrump himself posted several messages on Twitter encouraging Republicans to vote in the special election and recorded a get-out-the-vote call, saying, \"Liberal Democrats from outside of Georgia are spending millions and millions of dollars trying to take your Republican congressional seat away from you. Don\u2019t let them do it.\"\n\nTrump posted another tweet early Wednesday, saying, \"Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG 'R' win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!\"\n\nNational attention on the Georgia race, already significant, intensified after last week's closer-than-expected GOP victory in a Kansas special House election. Trump did not perform as well as other Republicans last November in the Georgia district, an affluent, well-educated swath of Atlanta's northern suburbs filled with the kind of voters Democrats need if they hope to reclaim a House majority next year.\n\nHandel has maintained her distance from Trump, rarely discussing him unless asked. Polling day took a bizarre turn in the district when key electronic voting logs were swiped from a Cobb County poll worker's pickup truck. The chairman of the county's Republican Party told media outlets that the theft raised the specter of fraud. However, there were no reports of voting irregularities at Cobb County polling places Tuesday.",
    " Title: 97% of Scientists Agree: Humans Contribute to Climate Change, Yet Public Trust in Scientific Community Remains Low\n\nArticle:\n\nA study by the University of Wisconsin indicates that only 42% of American adults have a great deal of confidence in the scientific community. This lack of trust, combined with other factors, contributes to the ongoing debate about climate change, despite a 97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming.\n\nAnthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, has been studying the reasons behind this debate for over a decade. He identified six categories of responses to the issue: \"The Alarmed,\" \"The Concerned,\" \"The Cautious,\" \"The Disengaged,\" \"The Doubtful,\" and \"The Dismissives.\"\n\n\"The Alarmed\" (16% of the public) believe climate change is an urgent problem but have no clear idea of how to fix it. \"The Concerned\" (27%) believe climate change is a problem but think it's more about polar bears and tiny islands than a problem that directly affects them. \"The Cautious\" (23%) are people on the fence, unsure whether global warming is real or man-made. \"The Disengaged\" (5%) are uninformed about climate change. \"The Doubtful\" (12%) do not think climate change is man-made, believing it's natural and poses no long-term risk.\n\nLeiserowitz considers \"The Dismissives\" (15%) the most problematic, as they deny the existence of climate change or claim it's a hoax, often citing unfounded conspiracy theories. This vocal minority has been amplified by the media, political stage, and funding from organizations within the fossil fuel industry.\n\nA recent study by Drexel University found that conservative foundations and others have bankrolled climate denial to the tune of $558 million between 2003 and 2010. This infusion of cash has given these voices a megaphone in the public square, according to environmental scientist Robert J. Brulle, the study's author.\n\nHowever, extreme weather events are forcing people to think about the impact of global warming on their lives, and religious leaders, including evangelicals, are increasingly taking a stand on the issue. The Pope may soon release an encyclical on ecology, instructing the faithful to respect the environment.\n\nIn the face of mounting evidence and growing awareness, the debate about climate change may gradually shift, as more people come to understand the urgency of the issue and the role humans play in it.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Officials Provide Varying Explanations on Triggers for Airstrikes Against Islamic State in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. military officials have provided conflicting and sometimes confusing explanations regarding the triggers for U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria. On Monday, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey appeared to tone down earlier comments he made about the growing terror network that has taken root in Iraq and Syria.\n\nDempsey, speaking to reporters on board a military plane traveling to Afghanistan, said he believes the Sunni insurgent group, formerly known as ISIS, is a regional threat, and he would not recommend airstrikes in Syria until they have become a direct threat to the U.S. He stated that the group is not currently plotting or planning attacks against the U.S. or Europe.\n\nHowever, Dempsey's spokesman, Col. Ed Thomas, clarified to Fox News on Monday that Dempsey \"believes that ISIS is a regional threat that will soon become a threat to the United States and Europe.\" Thomas added that Dempsey is preparing options to \"address\" ISIS in both Iraq and Syria \"with a variety of military tools including airstrikes,\" and believes a coalition of partners is necessary to confront the threat.\n\nRegarding what could prompt U.S. airstrikes in Syria, a senior U.S. Defense spokesman told Fox News that the judgment on whether the Islamic State is a threat against the homeland is just one trigger. \"Any threats against U.S. personnel and interests could drive action against ISIL in Syria,\" the official said.\n\nLast week, Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke in dire terms about the threat posed by the Islamic State, with Dempsey saying the organization could not be defeated without some action in Syria. The senior U.S. Defense spokesman said Monday that the message was the U.S. and its allies need a \"long-term strategy\" to separate ISIS from the population. \"In the meantime, if we see a plot against the homeland, of course we'll attack it,\" the official said.\n\nAsked Monday on Fox News whether the White House had pushed back on military officials' statements from last week, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said no. \"There has been no direction from the White House or anybody else to tone down the way we're speaking about ISIL,\" Kirby said.\n\nISIS has repeatedly made threats to attack the U.S. through social and conventional media. Earlier this month, in a Vice News documentary, a spokesman for the group vowed to \"raise the flag of Allah in the White House.\" The group took over Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, in June, and has since declared an Islamic state, or caliphate, in a swath of territory covering northeastern Syria and northern and western Iraq. U.S. airstrikes and a new policy of direct military aid to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have served as a check on a threatened ISIS advance toward Kurdish territory in northern Iraq.\n\nOn Sunday, Dempsey contrasted ISIS with the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has plotted and attempted attacks against the U.S. and Europe. As a result, the U.S. has conducted counterterrorism strikes against the group within Yemen. Dempsey said that so far, there is no sign that the Islamic State militants are engaged in \"active plotting against the homeland,\" so it's different than that which we see in Yemen.\n\nDempsey also told reporters that he believes that key allies in the region -- including Jordan, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia -- will join the U.S. in quashing the Islamic State group. \"I think ISIS has been so brutal, and has wrapped itself in a radical religious legitimacy that clearly threatens everybody I just mentioned, that I think they will be willing partners,\" said Dempsey, who added that those regional partners could come together and squeeze the Islamic State group \"from multiple directions in order to initially disrupt and eventually defeat them.\" It has to happen with them, much less with us.\"\n\nUp to now, when asked about airstrikes inside Syria, Dempsey and Hagel have said all options remain on the table. However, so far, there has been no broader authorization for such operations. The Obama administration has authorized airstrikes within Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the Islamic State. Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam, which Islamic militants had taken, but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops.\n\nSenior U.S. leaders, from the White House to the Pentagon, have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis. Officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the U.S. to Iraq is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government. One possibility, said Dempsey, would be to have U.S. forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the Iraqi force. He said military assessment teams looked at about 50 Iraqi brigades and a number of the Kurdish units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia. So far, Dempsey said the U.S. has not sought or received permission to put advisers into Iraqi brigades or headquarters units and accompany them into combat. To date, U.S. forces have conducted a total of 96 airstrikes across Iraq. Of those, 62 have been around the Mosul Dam.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans and Democrats Differ on Sequester Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-WY) stated on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that the country should prepare for the sequester spending cuts to take effect on March 1, despite a proposal by Senate Democrats last week to delay the cuts. The sequester, aimed at reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion over the next decade, was initially set to begin at the start of the year but was postponed by two months in the scaled-back fiscal cliff bill.\n\nWith less than two weeks remaining, lawmakers face another countdown before the sequester cuts are scheduled to commence. Senate Democrats proposed a $110 billion measure on Thursday to once again delay the cuts. The proposal includes increasing tax revenue from millionaires through closing loopholes, ending agriculture subsidies, and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends.\n\nSen. Barrasso, along with other Senate Republicans, expressed displeasure with the proposal, particularly the provision dealing with tax revenue. \"Taxes are off the table,\" he told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. \"The American people need to know that tax cuts are off the table, and the Republican Party is not in any way going to trade spending cuts for a tax increase.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama had vowed during his re-election campaign that the sequester would not occur, and he called on Congress earlier this month to pass a short-term measure to postpone the cuts. However, when his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, was questioned about it on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, McDonough sounded less certain the sequester would be prevented.\n\n\"I sure hope it doesn't (happen),\" he said. To \"ensure\" the cuts do not take place, McDonough said, the president \"will continue to make very reasonable and balanced proposals, as he has time and time again.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York expressed optimism about the issue. \"I think that Democrats have the high ground both substantively and politically, and we will win on this issue,\" he said on \"State of the Union.\" He argued that Republicans have no choice but to \"come on board.\"\n\n\"Their arguments are untenable and do not meet the favor of hardly anyone other than themselves and the few whose special interests they're protecting,\" he added.",
    " Title: Democratic Candidates Embrace Protectionist Trade Policies, Mimicking Trump's Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2020 presidential race, the likelihood of President Donald Trump securing a second term is expected to maintain his protectionist economic views and skepticism towards foreign trade as a guiding force in federal policy. This is evident as leading Democratic candidates, rather than distancing themselves from Trump's trade war-induced challenges for farmers and manufacturing workers, have been more inclined to address their concerns.\n\nDuring Tuesday's debate, the Democratic candidates, while expressing disagreements with Trump's methods, generally agreed with his approach to trade policy. For instance, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) praised the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Trump's proposed replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as an improvement over NAFTA. However, this improvement, as both Warren and Trump suggest, equates to less free trade.\n\nThe USMCA includes higher barriers to duty-free trade for automobiles and car parts, imposes new labor standards that increase the cost of manufacturing in Mexico, and has a 16-year sunset clause that introduces long-term uncertainty. While Warren is willing to support these steps, she also advocates for further protectionist measures.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also endorsed Trump's USMCA deal, while former Vice President Joe Biden offered a generally positive review, though he did not explicitly endorse it. The only significant note of disagreement came from Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who, like Warren, voted against NAFTA. Sanders criticized Trump's USMCA because it does not go far enough in his view.\n\nThe disagreement between Warren and Sanders on trade has garnered post-debate headlines, but the difference between their stances is primarily cosmetic. Both candidates aim for less free trade than currently exists, and both have expressed support for more trade barriers than what Trump has already implemented. This consensus that trade is detrimental to Americans, led by Trump, Warren, and Sanders, presents a challenge to those who favor free trade.\n\nIf any candidate in the Democratic primary field is expected to stand against this protectionist consensus, it would be Biden. He voted for NAFTA, attempted (and failed) to get Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) when he was part of the Obama administration, and occasionally makes valid points about the benefits of trade. However, Biden's stance on trade remains unclear, as he seems to be leaning towards the \"no new trade deals\" view advocated by Warren, albeit with fewer conditions.\n\nThe outcome of this trade policy shift, should Trump secure a second term, is likely to be detrimental for most, as it restricts free trade and may lead to economic turbulence for American farmers and manufacturers.",
    " Title: U.S. Public Opinion on President Trump and Economic Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study by Pew Research Center revealed that a majority of Americans expressed various negative emotions towards President Donald Trump's statements. The survey found that 76 percent of Americans were \"concerned,\" 70 percent were \"confused,\" 69 percent were \"embarrassed,\" 65 percent were \"angry,\" 62 percent were \"insulted,\" and 56 percent were \"frightened\" by the things Trump says.\n\nHowever, these negative sentiments do not seem to significantly impact Trump's re-election chances, according to the article. The author cites three reasons for this:\n\n1. The improvement in Americans' perception of economic conditions. The survey found that 76 percent of Americans rate economic conditions positively, an increase from 48 percent at the time of Trump's election.\n\n2. The progressive left's perceived hostility towards mainstream values, as suggested by the ongoing controversy over J.K. Rowling's tweet defending a woman who was fired for her views on transgenderism.\n\n3. The left's perceived overreaction and lack of accuracy in their criticisms of Trump, as the catastrophes they predict do not materialize, and the conspiracy theories they propose often prove unfounded.\n\nThe article also notes that Trump's average approval ratings have been steadily increasing since the end of October, suggesting that middle-of-the-road America views the president as less problematic than his critics claim.\n\nThe author also suggests that in a contest between Trump and his potential Democratic opponents, the unapologetic nature of Trump might give him an edge, despite the negative sentiments towards him.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting several long-term risks to the U.S. economy, including a declining birthrate, a national debt over $23 trillion, the erosion of the global free-trade consensus, threats to the political independence of the Federal Reserve, and the popularization of economic theories such as Modern Monetary Theory.",
    " Title: Nationwide Protests Erupt Over Ferguson Decision: A Summary of Events\n\nArticle:\n\nProtests erupted across the United States for the second consecutive night following the grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August. The demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, subsided on Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, with the National Guard protecting the Ferguson Police Department, handling crowd control, arrests, and use of tear gas, while local officers managed the situation. A total of 45 people were arrested, primarily for failure to disperse.\n\nIn Ferguson, one woman was taken into custody after protesters threw what appeared to be smoke bombs, flares, and frozen water bottles at a line of officers. Elsewhere, demonstrations in Oakland, California, resulted in vandalized police cars, damaged storefronts, and set fires in city streets. In Minneapolis, a car struck a protester and drove through a group of others, while in Portland, Oregon, police used pepper spray and made arrests after protesters disrupted bus and light rail traffic.\n\nThousands of people marched in Manhattan, gathering in Union Square and causing traffic disruptions on FDR Drive, Williamsburg Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, and the Queens Midtown Tunnel. NYPD Commissioner William Bratton stated that the police were giving protesters \"breathing room,\" as long as they remained nonviolent and did not cause fear or vandalism.\n\nIn other cities, protests took place. A car struck a pedestrian at a rally in an unspecified location, causing minor injuries. In Cleveland, several hundred people marched down a freeway ramp to block rush-hour traffic, protesting the Missouri developments and Saturday's fatal shooting by an officer of 12-year-old Tamir Rice of Cleveland, who was carrying a pellet gun that resembled a real firearm.\n\nIn St. Louis, riot police arrested demonstrators on Interstate 44 near the Edward Jones Dome, causing traffic disruptions for several hours before they were dispersed with pepper spray. In Atlanta, Georgia, several hundred people from historically black schools Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University held peaceful demonstrations, but some groups split off and tried to block a freeway, resulting in broken windows and the arrest of 21 people, primarily for failure to disperse when asked, with one person facing a weapons charge.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Call for Impeachment of President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest development, Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate, has joined the chorus of his fellow contenders advocating for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. O'Rourke's call stems from Trump's recent comments suggesting he would be open to accepting foreign intelligence on his 2020 rivals.\n\nWhile Trump has since walked back these comments, they have sparked calls for impeachment from several Democratic presidential hopefuls. O'Rourke stated during an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Trump's admission of accepting foreign assistance in future elections is grounds for impeachment proceedings.\n\nThis call for impeachment follows similar sentiments expressed by another Democratic candidate, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Klobuchar argued that soliciting something of value from a foreign country for campaign purposes is illegal, and Trump's actions are reminiscent of his 2016 campaign, when he publicly urged Russia to find and publish Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, another Democratic presidential candidate, also weighed in on the issue, stating that Trump's willingness to accept a foreign power's help in his 2020 campaign should prompt Congress to initiate impeachment hearings. De Blasio described Trump's assertion that he would not have to call the FBI if a foreign country offered information about an opponent as \"openly treasonous.\"\n\nThe idea of impeachment, while popular among Democratic base voters, is not yet supported by a majority of the general public, according to polls. The recent comments from the candidates raise questions about the Democrats' willingness to uphold norms of governmental behavior, such as the usually bright line between politics and federal prosecutions, that Trump has allegedly shattered.",
    " Title: Justice Department and North Carolina File Lawsuits Over Controversial \"Bathroom\" Law\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department and the state of North Carolina have filed dueling lawsuits over the state's controversial \"bathroom\" law, with the Obama administration responding to a lawsuit filed by Republican Governor Pat McCrory with legal action of its own.\n\nIn a suit filed late Monday in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, the DOJ alleged a \"pattern or practice of employment discrimination on the basis of sex\" against the state over the law requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch stated in a press conference late Monday afternoon that the suit was filed due to the creation of \"state-sponsored discrimination against transgender individuals.\"\n\nMcCrory, in his lawsuit, accused the administration of a \"baseless and blatant overreach\" in trying to get the policy scrapped. The state's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of North Carolina, stated that the administration is attempting to \"unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws.\"\n\nMcCrory, speaking at his own press conference, said Congress should get involved and \"bring clarity\" to federal anti-discrimination provisions, but urged the court to intervene in the current dispute. He stated that this is not just a North Carolina issue, but a national issue.\n\nThe state had faced a DOJ-imposed Monday deadline to respond to its demand that North Carolina either scrap the law or face legal action and risk losing federal funds. The DOJ, according to Lynch, retains the option of curtailing federal funding to the state Department of Public Safety and University of North Carolina.\n\nThe state law also limits state anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and blocks local governments from establishing their own. House Bill 2 has been criticized by gay rights groups, and entertainers including Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam have canceled shows. PayPal reversed plans to open a 400-employee operation center in Charlotte, and Deutsche Bank froze expansion plans near Raleigh.\n\nNearly 200 corporate leaders from across the country, including Charlotte-based Bank of America, have urged the law's repeal, arguing it's bad for business because it makes recruiting talented employees more difficult.\n\nSeveral other states have proposed similar laws in recent months limiting protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi sued that state over a law that will allow workers to cite their own religious objections to same-sex marriage to deny services to people.\n\nMcCrory states that the North Carolina law applies only to government offices, universities, and road-side rest stops, not every bathroom in the state. The Justice Department, though, had sent McCrory a letter last Wednesday stating the law violates federal civil rights laws.\n\nMcCrory, speaking over the weekend with \"Fox News Sunday,\" said he asked the department for an extension and was given only until the close of business Monday. He stated that \"I don't think that three working days is enough time for such a pretty big threat.\" He also stated that \"It's the federal government being a bully, making law.\"\n\nMcCrory also said he doesn't have the legal authority to change laws and that the expectation that he can is \"unrealistic.\" McCrory, who signed the bill into law in March, said last week that the department seems to be breaking new ground in claiming the North Carolina law violates Civil Rights Act protections against discrimination in education and the workplace. He also stated that the administration's warning means the issue is no longer confined to North Carolina.\n\n\"This is not just North Carolina,\" said McCrory, arguing that every university that accepts federal funding is now in the same situation as those in his state. Meanwhile, the administration is expected to soon take the bathroom issue further, to ensure that transgender student rights are fully protected under federal law, according to Politico. The move reportedly would be related to a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities, and multiple agencies are expected to be involved.",
    " Title: College Students' Reactions to Allegations Against Presidential Candidate Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nThe allegations against Presidential candidate Donald Trump have been a significant topic in the ongoing White House campaign to address sexual assault and end the perceived \"rape culture\" on college campuses. Some college students have expressed surprise at Trump's continued support, despite his comments about women and the allegations against him. However, many voters have already made up their minds and are unlikely to change their stance solely due to the issue of sexual misconduct.\n\nAlex Abbott, a senior at Hampden-Sydney College, an all-male campus in Virginia, stated, \"The idea that a candidate with a major-party backing has allegations of this nature on his record is vile.\" Yet, he added, the responses from men he had encountered were either \"I would never do anything like that,\" or \"Every guy does that, and it's not out of the ordinary.\"\n\nSurveys indicate that voters are primarily concerned about the economy and terrorism. However, the negative attention on Trump's sexual behavior is reportedly hurting him with female voters and independents, according to Republican pollsters. Despite this, Clinton's support has not significantly increased, suggesting that many Republicans still view Trump as morally acceptable, at least compared to the Clintons.\n\nAlan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, explained this phenomenon as \"negative partisanship.\" He stated, \"We vote against the other party/candidate more than for our own party/candidate, and that is especially true this year for Republicans.\"\n\nDemocrats, such as Jon Robin Baitz, an acclaimed Broadway playwright, also express disapproval of Trump. Baitz's latest work, \"Vicu\u00f1a,\" explores a tailor's relationship with a blustering Trump-like candidate, and will run this fall at the Kirk Douglas Theater in Los Angeles. Baitz lamented, \"My heart is broken. There is, to me, a kind of fundamental American decency, and it\u2019s just been lost in the prurient shallowness of the discourse.\"",
    " Title: The Clash of Rights: Same-sex Marriage and the Debate Over Religious Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nA contentious debate is unfolding in the United States over the intersection of same-sex marriage and religious freedom. The issue has sparked a heated discussion, with some arguing that opposition to same-sex marriage is a violation of a newfound \"right,\" while others maintain that the freedom of religion, speech, and association are being infringed upon.\n\nTelevision personality Bill Maher, in a controversial statement, referred to homosexual activists who oppose dissenting views as the \"gay mafia.\" These activists argue that same-sex marriage is not only a right but a matter of moral justice, while others contend that it is a preference, not a right.\n\nThe question at the heart of the debate is not whether laws can legislate morality, but rather, \"Whose morality will we legislate?\" While religions may teach certain moral rights, such as the right to life or property, these rights can be supported without religious affiliation. The issue of legislating morality is distinct from legislating religion, as the former involves the regulation of behavior, while the latter concerns religious practices and institutions.\n\nLiberals, in particular, have been criticized for their intolerance towards those with differing views. In the name of tolerance and diversity, some have been excluded or faced legal consequences for not conforming to the liberal agenda. This has led to a growing clash between real rights and the new right of same-sex marriage.\n\nHomosexual author Andrew Sullivan, in an article, expressed his disapproval of the intolerance displayed by some gay activists, citing the forced resignation of former Mozilla CEO Brandon Eich as an example. Sullivan argued that such behavior is antithetical to a tolerant and diverse society.\n\nThe conflict between homosexuality and religious liberty has led some to question whether there is a middle ground between celebrating same-sex marriage and upholding religious beliefs that prohibit such celebrations. Some argue that there is no middle ground, as the two positions are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nLesbian activist Chai Feldbaum, appointed by President Obama to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), has stated that religious liberty should take a backseat to the right of same-sex marriage. This stance has fueled concerns that the real rights of freedom of religion, speech, and association are being sacrificed in favor of the invented right of same-sex marriage.\n\nThe debate over same-sex marriage and religious freedom is a complex and emotionally charged issue, with both sides appealing to principles of justice, equality, and freedom. As the debate continues, it is essential to maintain a clear understanding of the rights at stake and to strive for a society that respects and protects the diversity of beliefs and perspectives.",
    " Title: Sanders' Momentum in Democratic Race: A Look at the Nevada Caucus Winner's Path to the Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, following his victories in the Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada caucuses, is gaining momentum in the Democratic primary race. With crucial battles in South Carolina on Saturday and Super Tuesday on March 3, Sanders is poised to potentially capture the Democratic nomination and transform the party.\n\nThe upcoming contests, however, may present challenges for Sanders, as he faces criticism for his self-proclaimed socialist ideology and concerns about his electability in the general election. Despite these attacks, Sanders has demonstrated his ability to defend his positions, and potential opposition may expose the political desperation of his opponents.\n\nIn South Carolina, former Vice President Joe Biden faces a significant challenge, as Representative Jim Clyburn, a powerful black politician in the state, is expected to endorse Biden. Clyburn warns that nominating a socialist like Sanders could lead to electoral disaster. With Clyburn's endorsement, Biden becomes the favorite in the primary, where 60% of the vote is African American.\n\nBiden also faces competition from billionaire Tom Steyer, who has invested heavily in South Carolina, hired black leaders, and pledged to support reparations for slavery. Polls show Steyer gaining support among black voters, potentially taking votes away from Biden. For Biden, South Carolina is a do-or-die state. If he wins here, he is revived.\n\nSanders is predicting victories in California and Texas, two of the megastates holding primaries on Super Tuesday. He has been gaining in the polls on Senator Elizabeth Warren, even in her home state of Massachusetts, which also holds its primary on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe question remains: With Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, Steyer, and Klobuchar\u2014none of whom has beaten Sanders in the popular vote\u2014who can beat a surging Sanders? When and where do they beat him?\n\nMichael Bloomberg, with his vast resources, may be able to buy enough votes to win some states. However, it remains unclear whether the other Democratic candidates, who have been competing for a year, would stand aside to yield the field to Bloomberg, an ex-Republican, to save their party from Sanders.\n\nThe Democratic establishment is concerned that if the \"moderates\" in the race do not start dropping out and uniting behind a single candidate to challenge Sanders, they may lose the nomination to Sanders and the election to President Donald Trump.\n\nSanders' vision for the Democratic Party includes Medicare for All, abolition of private health insurance, a Green New Deal, free college tuition, student debt forgiveness, open borders, Supreme Court justices committed to Roe v. Wade, welfare for undocumented migrants, and a doubling of the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nAs Winston Churchill once observed, \"Some regard private enterprise as if it were a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look upon it as a cow that they can milk. Only a handful see it for what it really is\u2014the strong horse that pulls the whole cart.\" Sanders sees free market capitalism as a means to be hectored, squeezed, and beaten into producing more. Those most receptive to his message are the young.\n\nPatrick Buchanan, an adviser to three presidents, two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and the nominee for the Reform Party in 2000, offers insights into the Sanders phenomenon in his latest book, \"The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From Defeat to Create the New Majority.\" For more of his reports, visit the provided link.",
    " Title: NSA's XKeyscore Surveillance Program Revealed in Leaked Documents by Edward Snowden\n\nArticle:\n\nEdward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, has leaked new documents that disclose the existence of a surveillance program called XKeyscore. The program, which the NSA claims is their \"widest-reaching\" program, allows NSA analysts to search through vast databases of emails, chats, and browsing histories from millions of people without prior authorization.\n\nIn the leaked documents published by The Guardian on Wednesday, the NSA boasts about XKeyscore's capabilities. A June 10 video by Snowden states that as an NSA agent, he had the ability to \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email.\" Intelligence officials have disputed this claim, but the documents on XKeyscore seem to provide more details on what Snowden was referring to.\n\nThe documents are training manuals for XKeyscore and detail how the NSA can mine enormous databases by filling out a simple on-screen form. The request doesn't undergo any court review or need clearance from higher-ranking NSA officials. According to one document, the XKeyscore search can cover \"nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet,\" and even monitor a person's online activity in real-time.\n\nIt isn't just metadata that the analysts can see. XKeyscore allows the NSA access to the content of emails and chats. XKeyscore can search by name, telephone number, IP address, and keywords. It does not require a warrant, nor does the person performing the search require legal authority.\n\nXKeyscore can also monitor activity on social media. Using the same tool that allows an NSA analyst to read the contents of stored emails, XKeyscore can read the content of Facebook chats and other private messages. An NSA analyst simply needs to input a Facebook user name and date range into a XKeyscore search.\n\nThe NSA claims that the system is effective. It asserted in one document that it had captured 200 terrorists with XKeyscore by 2008. One slide indicated that XKeyscore can search HTTP activity with a keyword, allowing the NSA to monitor \"nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet.\"\n\nThe Guardian published the documents on the same day that senior intelligence officials met with members of the Senate to release classified documents about the collection of phone records, PRISM, and the FISA court. The details of these programs and their legality are currently under debate.",
    " Title: Trump's Fundraiser for Veterans Charities Yields Less Than Half of Promised Amount\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than two months after Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump claimed to have raised $6 million for veterans' charities at a fundraiser held on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, most of the organizations targeted to receive the money have received less than half of that amount, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Journal, citing a survey of the 22 groups listed by Trump's campaign as prospective recipients for the money, reported that 19 organizations had obtained a total of $2.4 million from Trump's foundation or associates. Of the three other charities, one declined to disclose how much it had received, another said it needed to submit more paperwork before receiving any money, and the third did not respond to questions by the Journal.\n\nFox Business Network first reported in late February that only a fraction of the pledged donations had made their way to the veterans groups. At the time, FBN reported, several groups said they had not received any money. And seven of the 22 told Fox Business Network they had received a total of $650,000. Other groups did not respond to inquiries at the time.\n\nTrump held the Jan. 29 benefit in lieu of attending a GOP debate hosted by \u2588\u2588\u2588. The real estate mogul had declined to appear at the debate, claiming that he had not been treated fairly by the network.\n\nAll 19 groups that confirmed receiving money from the Trump event got checks in the mail. Sixteen charities saw donations arrive in late February in increments of $50,000 or $100,000. The other three reported smaller donations in March, with those amounts averaging between $5,000 and $15,000.\n\nKeith David of the Task Force Dagger Foundation told the Journal that he was confused about whether a $50,000 check from Trump associate Stewart Rahr's foundation was tied to the Iowa event. He said he had been informed by a Trump representative that it was. \"It\u2019s a little weird,\" David said. \"It looks like it\u2019s from a totally separate organization.\"\n\nHope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Trump has in fact \u201cgiven to the 22 groups we originally announced and many others.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we are continuing to distribute the money raised as it comes in and we are expanding the list of groups receiving contributions,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIf the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our Veterans have been so mistreated, rather than trying to disparage Mr. Trump\u2019s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation, we would all be better for it. He has raised millions of dollars for the Vets, and rather than being thanked, he is attacked. As Mr. Trump said, \u2018No good deed goes unpunished.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe did not say how much money raised at the event had been distributed, or how much each group has received.\n\nThe Journal, citing the Trump Foundation's tax returns, reported that the nonprofit had given just $180,000 to veterans' charities over the past decade. Hicks said that amount did not include personal donations by the candidate.\n\nAt least one prominent charity declined to receive any money from the January fundraiser. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) founder Paul Rieckhoff called the event a \"political stunt.\"",
    " Title: Romney Hesitates to Comment on Obama's Deportation Policy Reversal for Certain Illegal Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to President Obama's recent order to halt the deportation of some illegal immigrants, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, declined to state whether he would reverse the policy if he were to occupy the White House. During the Republican primary debates, Romney expressed his intention to veto the Dream Act, a legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants. However, in a more equivocal stance regarding Obama's order, Romney expressed support for a long-term solution for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\n\nOn the CBS program \"Face the Nation,\" Romney stated, \"With regards to these kids who were brought in by their parents through no fault of their own, there needs to be a long-term solution so they know what their status is.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers, including Romney, have accused President Obama of making a politically motivated move by issuing the order and bypassing Congress. Romney stated, \"If he felt seriously about this, he should have taken action when he had a Democratic House and Senate, but he didn't.\"\n\nThe president's order allows work permits and prevents deportation for as many as 1.4 million undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The president's support for the Dream Act in 2010 was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe president's immigration policies, which have focused on deportations, have been a source of concern for losing the enthusiasm of Hispanics, a crucial voting bloc. The president's move may have pre-empted Romney on a solution to illegal immigration, as he was reportedly edging toward an embrace of a Republican alternative to the Dream Act proposed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nAdvisers to Romney have stated that he is working on immigration policies and is expected to unveil them on Thursday when he speaks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Florida. Ana Navarro, an adviser on Hispanic issues to Senator John McCain in 2008, tweeted on Sunday, \"After Obama move, it's time. Romney NALEO speech Thurs is I-Day.\"\n\nIn other news, Romney expressed a hands-off approach to the European economic crisis, stating, \"We're not going to send checks to Europe. We're not going to bail out the European banks.\" He also reiterated economic proposals from the primary season, such as lowering tax rates and cutting government spending from 25 percent of the economy to 20 percent, which he said would \"ignite growth.\"\n\nRegarding another round of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, known as QE3, Romney expressed skepticism, stating, \"We'll go through that process with Congress.\"\n\nRomney is currently on a six-state bus tour of small towns to connect with everyday Americans. CBS's Bob Schieffer mentioned an alternative image of Romney from Saturday: the success of a dressage horse that his wife, Ann Romney, co-owns. The horse, Rafalca, won a berth on the United States Olympic team. Romney joked, \"I joke that I'm going to send her to Betty Ford for addiction to horses.\"",
    " Title: Investigative Report: Allegations of Misrepresentation Surrounding 2012 Benghazi Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nThe events surrounding the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have been the subject of ongoing controversy, with allegations that the Obama administration provided misleading information to the American public.\n\nInitially, the administration claimed that the attack was a result of a protest demonstration against an anti-Islamic video produced by an American. However, this account has been disputed, as there was no evidence of a protest demonstration in Libya during the attack, and officials on the ground in Libya did not report such an incident.\n\nThe highest-ranking American diplomat on the scene in Libya, who spoke directly with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by phone, stated that it was a terrorist attack. The President of Libya also announced that it was a terrorist attack, and the C.I.A. informed the Obama administration that it was a terrorist attack.\n\nAfter the initial account was discredited, the administration claimed that the information provided was the best available at the time from intelligence sources. However, this claim has been called into question, as 12 drafts of the Obama administration's talking points about Benghazi have been released, and each draft was revised to omit the clear and unequivocal statement that this was a terrorist attack.\n\nAttempts to suggest that Ambassador Susan Rice's false story about a \"spontaneous protest\" was the result of a lack of accurate information from intelligence sources have been exposed as a second lie to excuse the first lie.\n\nThe difference between an honest mistake and a calculated lie to deceive the American people, in order to win an election, has been a point of contention. The Obama administration's election campaign had claimed the death of Osama bin Laden as an accomplishment of the administration, as part of a general defeat of Al-Qaeda and other terrorists. Admitting that these terrorists were still active and capable of carrying out a well-coordinated attack would have been politically damaging during the election campaign.\n\nThe Obama administration's excuse for not attempting to provide help to the Americans in Benghazi while they were under attack has also been questioned. The administration claimed that it would take too long to deploy help, but this claim has been called into question, as a small fighting unit in Tripoli was ready to deploy to Benghazi when they were ordered to \"stand down.\"\n\nThomas Sowell, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, has written extensively on the subject, suggesting that the Obama administration's actions were politically motivated and that the truth is dangerous to liars. The Obama administration has yet to provide a full account of the events in Benghazi, and further investigations are likely to be necessary to determine the full extent of the misrepresentation and to hold those responsible accountable.",
    " Title: Kayleigh McEnany's Journey: From Bible Teacher to Political Commentator\n\nArticle:\n\nKayleigh McEnany, the current White House Press Secretary, has recounted her journey as one of strengthening her faith and beliefs during her time as a Bible teacher. This period also marked her experience as a minority in an oppositional environment. In a recent tweet, she acknowledged the late Christian pastor Ravi Zacharias as a significant influence, stating, \"When peers challenged the intellectual foundation for my faith\" at Oxford, Zacharias \"was the usher between the heart & the mind.\"\n\nMcEnany's admiration for Zacharias mirrored her desire to study at elite universities. She described Zacharias as someone who, from an academic perspective, could equip individuals with arguments for their faith without compromising intellectual integrity. This desire to defend her beliefs led McEnany to engage in intellectual debates with her peers during her time at Oxford.\n\nDuring a visit to Fox News, her potential talent caught the attention of Alan Colmes, then Sean Hannity's liberal antagonist on the program Hannity & Colmes. Colmes' mentorship led McEnany to an internship on his show. The two often engaged in political debates, and Colmes appreciated her for it. Later, he supported her as she faced challenging panels on CNN.\n\nAfter her 2010 college graduation, McEnany worked as a producer for former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee's Fox News show. During this time, she maintained a blog titled \"Defending Reagan Conservatism.\" Her political commentary was characterized by an air of righteousness, and her reading recommendations favored publications like The Economist.\n\nMcEnany's social media posts during this period occasionally leaned towards Trump-style birtherism and controversial comments about political figures. Despite this, she remained devout, regularly attending church and tweeting about her faith.\n\nElie Mystal, a writer at the progressive magazine The Nation, remembers debating with McEnany on various political issues before his appearances on Huckabee's show. \"We disagreed, but we disagreed honorably,\" he told a reporter. Several years later, when McEnany was in law school, her acquaintance with Mystal led to her position at Above the Law, a prominent legal blog where Mystal was writing at the time.\n\nIn Mystal's account, McEnany filled the token conservative slot for the mostly liberal website. He described the website as catering to what generates clicks, stating, \"You're looking at what makes clicks. And being crazy is going to get you clicks.\" However, he added, McEnany came across as a true believer in her arguments, not merely doing it for show, money, or power. Instead, her core belief lent authenticity to her work.\n\nThroughout her career, McEnany has maintained a conservative political stance, serving as a commentator on various cable news networks and, most recently, as the White House Press Secretary. Her journey from Bible teacher to political commentator highlights her dedication to her beliefs and her ability to engage in intellectual debates while maintaining a strong faith.",
    " Title: Trump's Data-Driven Strategy: A New Approach to Presidential Campaigning\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the 2016 U.S. presidency, Donald Trump, a controversial figure, has garnered significant attention and support, according to recent polls. The New York Times/CBS News poll indicates that Trump has 35 percent of the Republican vote, more than double the 16 percent of runner-up Ted Cruz. This article explores Trump's data-driven strategy and its potential impact on the upcoming primaries.\n\nTrump's unconventional approach to campaigning has generated controversy and widespread contempt since his presidential candidacy announcement in June. However, his data-driven strategy has proven effective, as he has been able to capture and analyze vast amounts of data that his opponents can learn from.\n\nPolitics, in the modern era, is heavily reliant on data analysis. Trump's social media presence, particularly on Twitter and Instagram, provides a wealth of data that his opponents can analyze to understand voter preferences and behaviors. His provocative statements and responses create a trove of data that a tech-savvy opponent should leverage to their advantage.\n\nTrump's Twitter account, with over 5.2 million followers, and his Instagram account, with more than 650,000 followers, serve as valuable sources of data. Every tweet, retweet, Facebook post, Instagram blast, and newscast lead generates data that can be captured, analyzed, and used against him.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump uses his social media accounts to deliver snarky messages and short videos, generating a significant amount of data that his opponents can analyze. This data can help opponents understand what resonates with voters and what does not, allowing them to tailor their messages and strategies accordingly.\n\nData analysis played a crucial role in Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, as he used data to identify undecided voters, learn about them, and persuade them to vote for him in the final days of the campaign. Jim Messina, who headed Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, stated that they based their tactics on big data, running 66,000 computer simulations of the election to inform their strategies.\n\nTrump understands the importance of data in modern politics and has applied this concept to his campaign. He has tapped into the public's desire for provocative, edgy, and controversial content, shaking up the electorate and forcing them to react. While some may dislike his statements, it is undeniable that his strategy is working, as he has been at the top of the polls for months.\n\nHowever, Trump's data-driven strategy also presents an opportunity for his opponents. Instead of focusing on condemning his statements, opponents should focus on understanding and learning from the data he generates. By analyzing the data, opponents can learn what resonates with voters and tailor their messages and strategies to appeal to those voters.\n\nIn the upcoming Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the time to invest in data analysis is now. The candidate who is smart enough to invest in the infrastructure needed to organize and analyze the Trump data trove will have a significant advantage in the race for the presidency. As Jim Messina stated, \"We spent two years and about $400 million trying to build up a capacity to predict people's behaviors and match that with social media... The final 96 hours of the 2012 race, a majority of Americans... went to the incumbent. And when you ask them why: 76 percent of those said because their friend or family member talked to them on social media and told them why they had to support Barack Obama.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's data-driven strategy has proven effective in capturing and analyzing vast amounts of data. His opponents should learn from this strategy, using the data he generates to understand voter preferences and tailor their messages and strategies accordingly. The candidate who is smart enough to invest in data analysis will have a significant advantage in the upcoming primaries and, ultimately, the race for the presidency.",
    " Title: Federal Tax Code Shifts Toward Renewable Energy Over Past Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nThe past decade has seen a significant shift in the U.S. tax code's benefits for various fuel sources, with renewable energy surpassing its counterparts in the oil, gas, and coal sectors. Federal tax \"preferences,\" such as tax credits for energy production, specific write-offs or deductions, or other benefits aimed at an energy subsector, have moved toward wind, solar, and other renewable fuels since 2008. This increase has come as tax preferences for fossil fuels have declined or remained relatively stable year after year.\n\nIn 2016, renewable energy received $10.9 billion in tax preferences compared to $4.6 billion for fossil fuels. A decade ago, fossil fuels received $8.2 billion while renewables pulled in only $5.3 billion in tax preferences, according to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures recently presented to Congress.\n\nThe dynamic began to shift in the early days of the Obama administration. The massive American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, along with increased production in the wind and solar power sectors, shifted tax preferences toward renewable energy. From 2008 to 2009, for example, tax preferences for green fuels jumped by nearly $10 billion, from $7.4 billion to $17.1 billion.\n\nAt the same time, tax preferences for fossil fuels decreased from $5.5 billion in 2008 to $3.6 billion in 2009. While the gap has narrowed since then, it still indicates a tilt toward renewable fuels in the current tax code.\n\nThe latest CBO figures also come against the backdrop of a broader debate about tax reform. Both President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are eager to rewrite the tax code, lower rates, and eliminate deductions. However, specialists say they will have an uphill battle to strip all of the energy carve-outs that have been implemented over the past decade.\n\n\"I think it's pretty difficult. Look at the wind production tax credit\u2014it keeps getting extended because there are a bunch of Republican senators from wind states,\" said Benjamin Zycher, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in energy and environmental policy.\n\n\"It's supposed to be phased out, but we'll see. I have my doubts. It's difficult to get rid of these things,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, tax credits for the production of wind power are routinely extended by Congress, though they're currently being phased out and are scheduled to end by 2019. That tax credit, along with other tax preferences for solar power and other renewable sources, accounted for more than $6 billion in tax preferences last year, according to CBO numbers. Another $4.2 billion went to biodiesel and renewable diesel credits, the CBO said.\n\nSpecialists routinely point out that much of the tax preferences have come about because of increased production in renewable energy, not just because of the establishment of new government policies favoring a given source.\n\nThe shift has been the result of tax policies and changes within the energy industry itself. The wind production tax credit, for example, was first enacted in 1992. The following year, renewable energy received just $900 million in tax preferences, compared to $2 billion for fossil fuels.\n\nThe tax credits have become more valuable in terms of dollar amounts simply because of the wind industry's expansion and significant increases in production, analysts say.\n\n\"These tax expenditures don't represent a shift\u2014there have been no changes in the tax provisions that deliver fossil fuel tax expenditures over the past decade\u2014but an increase in the renewable power investment and output that qualifies for the renewable tax expenditures,\" said Joseph Aldy, a professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School who studies energy and tax policy.\n\nAdditional government investment and preferential treatment through the tax code has spurred that production even more, creating a cycle. From 2007 to 2014, for example, wind capacity in the U.S. nearly quadrupled.\n\nOn the fossil fuels side, many of the tax-preference policies have been in place for decades. In 2016, the sector received $1.8 billion in tax preferences for the \"expensing of exploration and development costs for oil and natural gas,\" the CBO said, along with billions of dollars in benefits for the depreciation of gas distribution lines, \"geological and geophysical expenditures\" related to exploration, and other activities.\n\nLeading lawmakers, in theory, say they want to eliminate many of those tax preference schemes while lowering the broader tax rates for all businesses. Such a huge overhaul of the tax code will be politically difficult and incredibly complicated, but GOP leaders have the support of Mr. Trump, and the president seems especially interested in pushing through a tax-reform package following the failure to repeal Obamacare earlier this year.\n\n\"House Republicans are working to lower tax rates for all businesses to ensure they keep more of their earnings and decide how to best use their resources to create jobs and fund their operations,\" said Emily Schillinger, communications director for the House Ways and Means Committee, the chamber's tax-writing panel.",
    " Title: Pope Francis: A Humble and Unconventional Leader\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, took his name from St. Francis of Assisi, a medieval friar known for his devotion to the poor and nature. The Argentinian is not the first pope from outside Europe, but he is the first non-European pope in modern times.\n\nFrancis, the first Jesuit and the first Latin American to lead the Catholic Church, differs significantly from his recent predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, in several ways. Unlike them, he does not have a numeral after his name, as he is the first to take the name Francis.\n\nThe pope's choice of name is a tribute to St. Francis of Assisi, a man who renounced his family's wealth to live among the poor and the destitute. The Rev. Thomas Rosica, the Vatican's deputy spokesman, noted similarities between the two men, stating, \"Francis of Assisi is someone who turned his back on the wealth of his family and the lifestyle he had, and bonded with lepers and the poor.\"\n\nPope Francis is also known for his care for AIDS patients and single mothers whose babies were refused baptism by priests in his diocese. In 2013, he scolded those priests, saying, \"How can you turn these people away when they belong to us?\"\n\nIn addition to his religious duties, Pope Francis has broken with tradition in several ways. He is a humble man who takes public transportation, lives in an apartment instead of the archbishop's palace, and cooks his own meals. In his first public act as pontiff, he asked the estimated 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square to pray for him, rather than blessing the crowd first.\n\nPope Francis also refused to use a platform to elevate himself above the cardinals standing with him as he was introduced to the world as Pope Francis. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York and the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, noted, \"He met each of us on our own level.\"\n\nFrancis opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, but his career as a priest in Argentina coincided with the so-called Dirty War, during which as many as 30,000 people died or disappeared. Francis was accused of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal Jesuit priests, but he denied the charge.\n\nPope Francis takes the helm of a church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy. He may need to find a way to draw new Catholics into the church, where it is in decline, and to work with shifting viewpoints among Catholics, particularly on issues such as contraception and immigration.",
    " Title: McConnell Defends Vote to Raise Debt Ceiling, Faces Criticism from Primary Opponents\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) defended his decision to join Democrats in a vote to clear a filibuster hurdle for a bill to raise the debt ceiling on Friday at a campaign appearance in Louisville.\n\nMcConnell was one of 12 Republican senators to join Democrats on Tuesday in voting to end debate on the debt-ceiling bill, which will extend the federal debt limit for a year. This move has been criticized by his opponents, including Matt Bevin, a tea party conservative challenging McConnell in the Kentucky GOP primary in May.\n\nBevin, in a statement after the vote, said, \"Kentucky and America can literally no longer afford such financially reckless behavior from the likes of Mitch McConnell.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who threatened to filibuster the vote, criticized Senate Republicans for joining with Democrats to vote for the bill, saying, \"Every Senate Republican should have stood together.\"\n\nWhen asked about his opponents' comments, McConnell defended his position, stating, \"My preference is for a debt ceiling to carry additional legislation that does something about the debt.\"\n\nMcConnell pointed to his role in negotiating the Budget Control Act with Vice President Biden in August 2011, which led to a deficit-reduction package that reduced government spending for two years. He attributed the House's inability to come together on a different version of the bill as the reason for his vote in favor of a clean debt-ceiling bill.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, after unsuccessfully trying to gather enough Republicans to vote on a new version of the bill, joked, \"You know, Mother Teresa is a saint now, but if the Congress wanted to make her a saint and attach that to the debt ceiling, you probably couldn't get 218 Republican votes.\"\n\nMcConnell also defended his record as a legislator who averts crises, stating, \"I believe I have to act in the best interest of the country, and every time we've been confronted with a potential crisis, the guy you're looking at is the one who stepped up and solved the problem.\"",
    " Title: David Gergen Praises Bill Clinton's Effective Speech at Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the third and final night of the Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton delivered a rousing speech that, according to political analyst David Gergen, added strength to the convention and effectively attacked the Romney-Ryan budget plan. Gergen, a political adviser to four U.S. presidents, noted that Clinton's speech was particularly effective in highlighting President Obama's stewardship and exposing vulnerabilities in the Republican budget plan.\n\nClinton's speech, which was well-received by the audience, was described as the best and most influential he has given since leaving the White House over a dozen years ago. The former president's ability to tell Obama's story and critique the Republican budget plan was seen as a potential game-changer, particularly in terms of appealing to older voters and those who may be swayed by Democratic arguments.\n\nHowever, Gergen emphasized that the Democratic Party still faces challenges, particularly in terms of President Obama's ability to deliver a compelling case for re-election. Obama is expected to speak on Thursday, and Gergen noted that the president has given numerous prime-time speeches in the past, with audiences shrinking over time. Voters, Gergen said, are increasingly skeptical of words and are seeking deeds.\n\nFurthermore, Gergen pointed out that no one at the convention has yet provided a clear sense of Obama's plan to address the economic crisis. The public, Gergen noted, is unlikely to be persuaded by half-measures and vague assurances about future economic growth. Instead, they are seeking a detailed roadmap for economic recovery.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Democratic National Convention has revived Democratic spirits and set up President Obama for a strong speech on Thursday, the ultimate success of the party rests on Obama's ability to deliver a compelling case for re-election, address voter skepticism, and provide a clear plan for economic recovery.",
    " Title: Snowden Reveals Concerns Over U.S. Cyberterrorism Program \"MonsterMind\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Wired magazine, former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden discussed his decision to leak government secrets, focusing on a controversial cyberterrorism counterattack program known as \"MonsterMind.\" Snowden, photographed for the story with an American flag, stated that the program, designed to detect and respond to foreign cyberattacks, could potentially cause more harm than good due to the risk of misdirection.\n\nSnowden explained that malware could be routed through an innocent third-party country, leading to potential retaliation against unintended targets. He stated, \"These attacks can be spoofed. You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?\"\n\nSnowden, who is 31 years old, also expressed his desire to return to the U.S. someday, stating, \"I told the government I'd volunteer for prison, as long as it served the right purpose. I care more about the country than what happens to me. But we can't allow the law to become a political weapon or agree to scare people away from standing up for their rights, no matter how good the deal. I'm not going to be part of that.\"\n\nSnowden leaked details of U.S. surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post in June 2013, sparking a global uproar. At the time, Snowden was in hiding in Hong Kong and later fled to Moscow, where he currently resides.\n\nPresident Obama pledged to scale back surveillance of American citizens, and Germany ordered the CIA station chief out of the country. The Guardian and Post won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for their coverage.\n\nSnowden has previously expressed interest in returning to the United States, but he fears an unjust trial on charges of espionage and theft of government property could result in a lengthy prison sentence. He remains adamant that his actions were for the good of the country.\n\nRegarding the MonsterMind program, Snowden told Wired that it could potentially start a war and poses a significant threat to privacy, as it requires the NSA to gain access to virtually all private communications coming in from overseas. Snowden stated, \"The argument is that the only way we can identify these malicious traffic flows and respond to them is if we're analyzing all traffic flows. And if we're analyzing all traffic flows, that means we have to be intercepting all traffic flows. That means violating the Fourth Amendment, seizing private communications without a warrant, without probable cause or even a suspicion of wrongdoing. For everyone, all the time.\"\n\nSnowden's comments highlight the breadth of NSA surveillance and the potential risks associated with such programs. He warned of the slippery slope created by accepting and justifying rule-breaking and dishonesty in the name of national security.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Congress to Complete Immigration Reform Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama used a naturalization ceremony at the White House on Monday to call on Congress to complete the ongoing immigration reform process. The event, held in the East Room, served to increase pressure on lawmakers whose leaders are reportedly nearing agreement on a comprehensive immigration bill.\n\nDuring the ceremony for 28 new U.S. citizens, President Obama stated, \"The time has come to fix it once and for all.\" He emphasized the need for political courage to address the nation's immigration system, stating, \"We've just got at this point to work up the political courage to do what\u2019s required to be done.\"\n\nCongress is currently on a two-week recess for Easter, during which time aides are continuing to draft legislation that is expected to be introduced next month. A bipartisan group of senators is working on a proposal that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants while allowing tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers into the country.\n\nOne of the sticking points in the proposal is the wages for lower-skilled temporary workers, which has led to a dispute between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. Under the proposal, as many as 200,000 immigrants would be granted visas each year for low-skilled jobs that U.S. employers have difficulty filling.\n\nIn the House, Speaker John A. Boehner has stated that a bipartisan bill could be introduced in the next few weeks. President Obama called the progress \"good news,\" but he emphasized the need for Congress to complete its work soon.\n\nThe legislation will call for increased border control, though U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently informed lawmakers that it does not have a way to effectively measure border security. Not all powerful lawmakers are on board with the \"speedy bill\" approach favored by President Obama and Capitol Hill's leaders.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and five other Republican senators have called for more hearings and time to study before any bill is pushed through the committee. They pointed out that 43 new senators have joined the chamber since 2007, when the last major congressional push on immigration happened.\n\nWhile in the past the issue divided each party and its constituents, Democrats are increasingly united behind President Obama's push. However, Republicans are split between concerns about border security and a desire to win over Hispanic voters, who have been reluctant to vote for GOP presidential candidates in the past two elections.\n\nPresident Obama has made immigration one of the top priorities of his second term, mindful of a long-standing promise to Hispanic voters that he would achieve the goal. The movement on the issue since November's elections also reflects concern among Republican lawmakers about Hispanics' growing support for Democratic candidates, and the perception among Hispanics that the GOP is anti-immigration.\n\nThirteen of the people who took the oath of citizenship at the White House are members of the U.S. military. The president praised them for \"a willingness to risk their lives in defense of a nation that was not yet their own.\" He added, \"That's a remarkable act, [which] made each of them in some ways American even before it was official, because that kind of service and sacrifice has defined our nation for more than two centuries.\"",
    " Title: Asian Vote Emerges as New Battleground in U.S. Congressional Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2022 U.S. Congressional elections, a new focus has emerged on the Asian-American population, particularly in urban and suburban areas. This shift is evident in regions such as Fairfax, Virginia, and other areas like northern New Jersey, the greater Atlanta area, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, and the West Coast.\n\nCandidates from both major parties have intensified their efforts to win over this diverse and rapidly growing immigrant population. They have emphasized their support for small businesses, public education, and issues specific to various ethnic groups.\n\nAt a recent event in Fairfax, Congressman Gerry Connolly addressed the crowd in several languages, including Korean, Chinese, and Thai. Former Lt. Gov. Don Beyer, running for Congress in a nearby district, highlighted the number of foreign-born employees at his Volvo dealerships. Republican state Del. Barbara Comstock, a contender for the open 10th District House seat, touted her support for legislation referring to the Sea of Japan as the East Sea, a name favored by Koreans.\n\nNonpartisan voter turnout leaflets emphasized the importance of participating in the democratic process, recalling historical events such as World War II-era Japanese internment and racially restrictive 19th-century immigration rules.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, whose campaign has run TV ads in Vietnamese and offers versions of its website in Mandarin and Hindi, stated that it is essential for the Republican Party to \"show up\" before these communities' distrust of Republicans becomes permanent.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Judy Chu, the Democrat who leads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, noted that both parties increasingly view Asian Americans as a \"margin of victory\" population in some challenging races. She pointed to the Virginia race between Comstock and Democratic Fairfax County Supervisor John Foust as a prime example.\n\nPollsters caution that it is difficult to generalize about Asian-American voters due to the vast diversity within the population. However, partisan strategists and Asian-American activists suggest that there are common preoccupations across culturally disparate immigrant groups, such as an intense focus on education and concern about the economic environment for small, family-owned businesses.\n\nThere is also a growing affinity for the Democratic Party, which is perceived as the party that stands for racial and ethnic diversity and a more inclusive federal immigration policy. In the 2012 elections, Asian Americans voted for the president by a larger margin (47 points) than Latinos. In swing-state Virginia, where Asian Americans made up 3% of the electorate, they supported Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine by 32 points. In 2010, in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's close reelection fight, Asian voters were 4% of the Nevada electorate, and nearly four in five supported the embattled incumbent.",
    " Title: FBI Releases Court Records Detailing Surveillance of Former Trump Campaign Aide Carter Page\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The FBI has released over 400 pages of material filed with a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to request a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign aide who investigators believed was collaborating with Moscow. The documents provide new detail about the early phases of the FBI's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n\nThe documents, which were redacted in vast portions, reveal that two requests to extend the surveillance of Page were approved by Trump's appointees in the Department of Justice, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe FBI's applications suggest the bureau had broader suspicions about Page and his potential ties to the Russian government. Four federal judges, all appointed by Republican presidents, approved the surveillance requests, each finding the government had shown \"probable cause\" that Page was acting as an agent of Russia.\n\nPage, a former campaign aide to Trump, denied that he collaborated with the Russian government to interfere with the election. Speaking for the first time since the documents were made public, Page told CNN the allegations were \"a complete joke.\" Page has not been charged with a crime, despite the extended surveillance.\n\nThe FBI began monitoring Page in October 2016. The surveillance was carried out under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to monitor communications when it can persuade a judge that someone is working as an agent of a foreign power. The documents show the surveillance continued into 2017.\n\nInvestigators said that they had collected evidence that \"the Russian Government\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election were being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Trump\u2019s campaign.\"\n\nThe documents were made public after a week in which the White House was repeatedly forced to walk back comments made by President Trump about Russia, including during a joint appearance with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. During a joint news conference last week, Trump appeared to accept Putin's denial of Russia's attempt to influence the election, but later clarified he thought Moscow was involved. The White House then clarified that Trump believes Russia is still attempting to target U.S. elections after the president appeared to answer a reporter's question hours earlier saying Russia is not.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the James Madison Project, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government accountability, filed a lawsuit last year under the Freedom of Information Act seeking records about surveillance of Trump\u2019s campaign. The suit came after Trump claimed the Obama administration \"wire-tapped\" Trump Tower before the election.",
    " Title: Trump Promotes 'Fair Trade' Agenda at Davos, Stresses U.S. Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump emphasized his commitment to prioritizing American interests in trade during his address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday, stating, \"America First, not America alone.\" The U.S. is open for business, he said, and urged foreign investors to take advantage of the country's competitive economic environment.\n\nIn his inaugural speech at the global finance summit, Trump lauded the economic achievements of his first year in office, including cutting corporation tax and lowering the unemployment rate. He highlighted the strong economy as a reason for foreign investors to \"bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America.\"\n\nDespite the \"America First\" policy's apparent contradiction with the Davos conference's goal of promoting globalization and cooperation, Trump's message was more nuanced than expected. He stated that the U.S. did not want a trade war but instead sought fair trade.\n\nTrump's comments come amid concerns about increased protectionism and potential trade barriers under his administration. However, he demanded a reformed international trade system that was \"fair and reciprocal\" and accused unidentified countries of unfair practices, including \"massive intellectual property theft\" and providing state aid to industry.\n\nThe U.S. president also expressed a preference for bilateral fair trade agreements with other countries, including those that were part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from which he has withdrawn. He suggested negotiating with TPP states collectively if it was in America's interest.\n\nTrump's speech was met with a muted response from the audience, with some expecting a more conciliatory tone. However, he had an overall positive reception, with cheers on his arrival and a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, where he expressed optimism about increased trade between the U.S. and Britain in the coming years.\n\nIn a question and answer session after his address, Trump faced boos when he attacked the media and repeated accusations of them reporting \"fake news.\" He also expressed a willingness to apologize for retweeting posts from a British far-right group, a move that sparked a Twitter row with May.\n\nThe speech comes days after the U.S. announced new tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines and solar panels, prompting an outcry from China and South Korea, the primary targets of the measure. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, also in Davos, has warned of \"more to come\" on trade tariffs.",
    " Title: President Obama Prepares to Issue Executive Orders on Gun Control in Response to Oregon Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has expressed his anger following the shooting at an Oregon community college campus that left nine dead and several more injured. This latest shooting at a school campus has reportedly prompted the President to prepare executive orders to expand background checks for gun buyers.\n\nThe Republican response has primarily been to defend against the onslaught of progressives advocating for more gun control and a reduction of guns in the country. The President, however, feels that the public may be near a tipping point, and his own time in office is slipping by without any progress on this issue.\n\nThe article suggests several proposals to reduce mass shootings, focusing on separating legal gun ownership from illegal ownership, modifying HIPAA laws to prevent people with severe mental illnesses from purchasing a gun, installing metal detectors in publicly funded schools, arming trained and tested employees in schools, and outlawing gun-free zones.\n\nThe article argues that these proposals address the issue of mass shootings without conceding the argument that guns are the issue and they need to be regulated even more. The proposals do not expand background checks or create more restrictions on gun ownership but instead aim to add common sense to the difficult issue, help protect those in vulnerable settings, and respect the right of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that what is needed is a Republican courageous enough to advance a set of proposals like this and not back down. It calls for the need to stop allowing ourselves to be painted into a defensive corner and to take back the narrative on guns from those who use it to control us.",
    " Title: CNN Continues to Pursue Counterintelligence Investigations Despite Mueller Report's Conclusion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a summary of the Mueller report, Attorney General William Barr stated that the Special Counsel did not find any evidence of U.S. persons or Trump campaign officials or associates conspiring or knowingly coordinating with the Russians in their efforts. However, CNN continues to pursue counterintelligence investigations and speculate on potential compromises between President Trump and Russia.\n\nOn Monday night, host Erin Burnett began her show, OutFront, by discussing the possibility of President Trump or members of his inner circle being \"compromised\" by the Russians. She referenced California Congressman Adam Schiff, who often claimed to have direct evidence of collusion but was proven incorrect by the Special Counsel.\n\n\"Our investigation is always focused on counterintelligence issues, that is, is the President or anyone around him compromised in some way. That work has to go on,\" Schiff said in a soundbite. Burnett questioned whether this was part of Mueller's investigation, and CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz responded that it was and continues to be something that the FBI and counterintelligence investigators will always look for.\n\nEarly in CNN's Tuesday prime time lineup, CNN analyst Ralph Peters claimed that the debunked Steele dossier still \"rings true to me\" despite Mueller's findings. He received no pushback from host Anderson Cooper.\n\nLater in the evening, Prime Time host Chris Cuomo emphatically asserted that \"there could be ample proof\" of collusion in Mueller's full report. Cuomo suggested that evidence for collusion could be folded into the counterintelligence investigation, which the AG did not mention in the summary.\n\nDespite the summary stating that the Special Counsel did not find evidence of collusion, CNN's #FactsFirst mantra appears to have been called into question, with some hosts and analysts continuing to speculate on potential compromises and counterintelligence issues.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton to Attack Donald Trump's National Security Plans in Major Foreign Policy Speech\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, is set to deliver a major speech on foreign policy on Thursday in San Diego, California. The speech, scheduled for 11:30 a.m. local time, will outline a clear contrast between Clinton's plans and those proposed by her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.\n\nClinton's campaign has stated that the speech will address Trump's national security plans, including his proposal to have Mexico pay for a border wall and his suggestion of temporarily banning Muslims from entering the U.S. Jake Sullivan, Clinton's senior policy adviser, has indicated that the speech will outline why Trump is \"fundamentally unfit\" to be president.\n\nSullivan further stated, \"You will hear in her speech a confidence in America and our capacity to overcome the challenges we face while staying true to our values \u2013 a strong contrast to Donald Trump's incessant trash-talking of America.\"\n\nClinton's campaign expects to secure the final delegates needed to officially become the party's nominee after the California and New Jersey primaries on June 7. Clinton currently has 2,312 delegates, including 543 super delegates, to Bernie Sanders' 1,545 delegates, including 44 super delegates, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn a Wednesday night speech at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Clinton called Trump a \"fraud.\" Her remarks focused on newly released documents that show Trump University encouraged staff to target prospective students' financial weakness in order to enroll them in expensive courses. Clinton stated, \"This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Barack Obama delivered a hit on Trump in a speech in Elkhart, Indiana, the same day. The U.S. president stated that a Trump presidency would increase the risk of a financial crisis. Obama said, \"The Republican nominee for president has already said he'd dismantle all these rules that we passed. That is crazy.\"\n\nTrump is also campaigning in California. Speaking in Sacramento on Wednesday night, he responded to Obama's claims by calling the president \"a total lightweight.\"",
    " Title: The Parallels Between Digital Surveillance and Speech Control in the U.S. and Authoritarian States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing digital surveillance and speech control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States are not unprecedented, as they represent an acceleration of long-standing trends towards increased censorship and surveillance of digital networks. The practices adopted by American tech platforms during the pandemic are not a departure from prior developments but a continuation of them.\n\nWhile the United States and authoritarian states such as China exhibit constitutional and cultural differences, the private sector, rather than the federal and state governments, currently leads in digital surveillance and speech control practices. However, the trend towards greater surveillance and speech control, as well as the growing role of government, is undeniable and likely inexorable.\n\nIn the debate over freedom versus control of the network over the past two decades, China has been largely right, and the United States has been largely wrong. Significant monitoring and speech control are inevitable components of a mature and flourishing internet, and governments must play a large role in these practices to ensure the internet is compatible with a society's norms and values.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the U.S. government and powerful young tech firms promoted nonregulation and American-style freedom of speech as essential features of the internet. This approach assumed that authoritarian states would crumble in the face of digital networks that seemed to have American constitutional values built into them. The internet was a vehicle for spreading U.S. civil and political values; more speech would mean better speech platforms, which in turn would lead to democratic revolutions around the world.\n\nChina, however, became concerned about unregulated digital speech\u2014both as a threat to the Communist Party's control and to the domestic social order more generally. It began building ever more powerful mechanisms of surveillance and control to meet these threats. In 2009, China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation announced their \"agreement on cooperation in the field of international information security.\" The agreement presciently warned of a coming \"information war,\" in which internet platforms would be weaponized in ways that would threaten nations' \"social and political systems.\"\n\nDuring the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the United States helped secure digital freedoms for people living in authoritarian states. It provided resources to support encryption and filter-evasion products designed to assist individuals in \"circumventing politically motivated censorship,\" as then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in 2010. The U.S. also openly assisted Twitter and other U.S. tech platforms that seemed to be fueling the Arab Spring.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Record on Women's Rights Under Scrutiny Amidst Foreign Funding Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton's record on promoting women's rights around the world is under review, with her actions as Secretary of State and foreign funding questions surrounding her family foundation raising questions about her connections to regimes that are not supportive of women's interests, according to Politico.\n\nClinton is expected to emphasize her experience at the State Department and her work on women's issues as First Lady and Senator. However, her friendly relations with governments such as Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries may require a more nuanced explanation, Politico suggests, as she faces challenges in her presidential bid.\n\nThe so-called \"Hillary Doctrine\" is based on her own statements on human rights, where she declared, \"The subjegation of women [is] a threat to the common security of our world and to the national security of our country.\" However, this stance contrasts with her interactions with world leaders like Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal and the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of millions in donations from Middle Eastern nations like Qatar, Oman, Algeria, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn these countries, gender inequality is not only prevalent but is deeply ingrained in their societies. Politico reported that as recently as last week, Clinton defended her record when questions arose about the foundation's donations. She stated, \"There can\u2019t be any mistake about my passion concerning women\u2019s rights here at home and around the world. So I think that people who want to support the foundation know full well what it is we stand for and what we\u2019re working on.\"\n\nHowever, others question Clinton's record and are reevaluating it as she prepares for a national campaign. Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, told Bloomberg, \"What exactly are her grand accomplishments on behalf of women?\" Pletka added, \"I\u2019m really impressed with how she turned around Saudi Arabia. She does not do much more than talk.\"\n\nOther powerful women in the political and business sphere have also expressed skepticism about Clinton's contradictions. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, for example, criticized Clinton in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, stating, \"Clinton tweets about women's rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights.\"\n\nThe Clinton family foundation has also faced scrutiny for its donations from Middle Eastern countries. Bill Clinton defended the foundation's donations, stating, \"Do we agree with everything they do? No. You\u2019ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Hillary Clinton's record on women's rights is under review, with some questioning the consistency between her public statements and her interactions with governments that do not support women's rights. The Clinton family foundation's donations from Middle Eastern countries have also raised questions about their connections to these regimes.",
    " Title: Facebook's Fact-Checking System and a Proposed Transparent Alternative\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has been utilizing a fact-checking system since December 2016, where independent fact-checking organizations identify false and misleading information. Users attempting to post such content are presented with a pop-up explaining the issues with the news and asking for confirmation to continue. Facebook does not prevent users from sharing disputed information, but they monitor how often users flag stories as fake news.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Facebook secretly calculates scores representing how often users' flags align with the analysis of independent fact-checkers. These scores are used internally to identify abuse of the flagging system and are not released to users.\n\nIn a paper published in the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, philosopher Regina Rini proposed a more transparent system. Instead of calculating a secret score, Facebook should display a simple reliability marker on every post and comment. This marker would indicate how often a user shares disputed information after being warned that the information might be false or misleading.\n\nThe proposed system would not involve censorship. Facebook would not suppress posts from users with poor reliability markers, allowing users to post whatever they want. However, users would have the choice to consider the reliability marker before sharing information.\n\nRini suggests that a green reliability marker could indicate that the user doesn't share much disputed news, a yellow dot could indicate occasional sharing, and a red dot could indicate frequent sharing.

    " Title: Trump and the Media: A Tense Relationship Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and the news media are entering into an uneasy relationship, with distrust and ill feelings on both sides. The acrimony that characterized the final months of the presidential campaign is not expected to dissipate.\n\nDuring a Tuesday meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times, Trump offered an olive branch, acknowledging his longtime readership of the newspaper and expressing a willingness to develop a professional working relationship. \"I would like to turn it around,\" Trump said. \"I think it would make the job I am doing much easier.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's words may do little to assuage the press's fears. White House reporters are concerned about access to Trump, who did not allow reporters on his campaign plane and abandoned media staking out Trump Tower last week to have dinner with family at New York's 21 Club.\n\nThe president-elect's frequent threats to the press have added to a sense that the rules for covering this White House might be different. \"Every incoming president has basic, generally agreed-upon rules of the road,\" said Joe Lockhart, who served as White House press secretary for President Bill Clinton. \"The Trump team has decided they'll blow up the road and build a new one. Where it goes from here will be a test of how far the new president and his team want to push things, and the strength and will of the press to push back.\"\n\nTrump's transition team has committed to having a press pool, which allows for a small group of reporters to remain stationed near the president to document his movements. The pool was on hand for significant events such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, and during George W. Bush's movements on 9/11.\n\nHowever, there are no laws requiring an administration to maintain a press pool or grant access to administration officials, news outlets, the briefing room, or White House grounds. During his primary campaign, Trump blackballed some news outlets from covering his rallies, which were open to the public, due to his displeasure with their coverage. He also singled out individual reporters for ridicule and whipped up a frenzy against the media at his rallies, where Trump supporters would jeer at the press pen.\n\nTrump has not held a formal press conference\u2014where reporters from a range of media outlets can ask him questions\u2014since July. The Trump campaign once criticized Hillary Clinton for doing the same. But Trump has little incentive to go through traditional media channels, some experts say.\n\nFacebook and Twitter combine to give him one of the most powerful social media presences in the world. He has former Breitbart executive Stephen Bannon at his side in the White House, giving him a powerful ally in the massively influential world of right-wing news. When Trump releases a straight-to-camera video to announce his 100-day agenda, as he did this week in lieu of a press conference, it elicits the same volume of coverage as a press conference would.\n\nPress advocates are worried that the president-elect appears to be holding all the cards. \"Over the last 20 to 30 years, each White House has thrown up more obstacles and become more obsessed with controlling their own message,\" said Craig Aaron, president of the advocacy group Free Press. \"But this is a new apex, and it's really dangerous. There used to be basic norms. You have to assume anything is possible now.\"\n\nThe media will receive little sympathy from the public, with a favorable rating sitting at an all-time low in the latest Gallup survey. Only 32 percent of Americans say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the press. Trump's allies believe all their moves to push back against what they view as a hopelessly biased liberal media are justified. They are furious over what they see as a press corps that has dropped any pretense of objectivity in covering Trump, and they are sick of what they view as breathless coverage of frivolous stories.\n\nTrump allies are also apoplectic over the media's obsession with the alt-right and neo-Nazis who gathered in Washington, D.C., over the weekend to pledge fealty to Trump, arguing that Trump has condemned racism repeatedly and has no ties to either group. By several accounts, there were as many reporters and protesters at the event as there were white nationalists, raising questions about why the event has attracted so much attention.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Republican National Committee strategist Sean Spicer exploded at anchor Wolf Blitzer for badgering him on the issue. \"You've asked me eight times the same question,\" Spicer shouted. \"It's the news media over and over again. But I don't know how many times he has to answer that question and you figuring out the way and fashion he should do it next. If he gives a speech, should he then write it in the sky in an airplane? At what point is it enough?\"",
    " Title: USCIS Preparing for Potential 9 Million Work Authorization Permits, Suggesting Executive Amnesty\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has issued a draft solicitation for bids, indicating a potential preparation for a large-scale executive amnesty. The document, released on Oct. 6, outlines the need for vendors to handle a \"surge\" scenario of 9 million identification cards in one year to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements.\n\nThe request for proposals (RFP) states that the agency will require a minimum of four million cards per year, with an additional five million cards in the \"surge\" scenario in 2016, totaling 9 million cards. The RFP does not specify how many of these cards will be Permanent Residency Cards (PRC), commonly known as green cards, and how many will be Employment Authorization Documentation (EAD) cards.\n\nJessica Vaughan, an immigration expert at the Center for Immigration Studies and former State Department official, stated that the document suggests a new program of remarkable breadth. Vaughan noted that the \"surge\" scenario, even with the relatively high four million cards per year, would represent a 125% increase in the agency's normal annual output.\n\nWhile federal agencies often plan for contingencies, the RFP specifically explains that the surge is related to potential changes in immigration policy. The document states, \"The Contractor shall demonstrate the capability to support potential'surge' in PRC and EAD card demand for up to 9M cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements.\"\n\nLast year, such a plan might have been attributed to a forthcoming immigration bill. However, following the summer's border crisis, the chances of such a new law are extremely low, giving additional credence to the possibility the move is in preparation for an executive amnesty by President Obama.\n\nEven four million combined green cards and EADs is a significant number. In the first two years after Obama unilaterally enacted DACA, about 600,000 people were approved by USCIS under the program. Statistics provided by USCIS on its website show that the entire agency had processed 862,000 total EADs in 2014 as of June.\n\nVaughan noted that EADs are increasingly coming under scrutiny as a tool used by the Obama administration to provide legalization for groups of illegal aliens short of full green card status. In addition to providing government approval to work for illegal aliens, EADs also cost significantly less in fees to acquire, about $450 compared to more than $1000. In many states, EADs give aliens rights to social services and the ability to obtain drivers' licenses.\n\nVaughan also pointed out that there are currently about 4.5 million individuals waiting for approval for green cards, having followed immigration law and obtained sponsorships from relatives in the U.S. or otherwise. This number is less than the number of id cards contemplated by the USCIS \"surge.\"\n\nUSCIS officials did not provide additional information about the RFP by press time.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Declares Trump Administration's Sanctuary City Funding Threat Illegal and Unconstitutional\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York has ruled that the executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January, which withheld federal funding from sanctuary cities, is both illegal and unconstitutional. The ruling, made on Friday, follows a series of recent court decisions that have invalidated Republican actions against asylum-seekers and sanctuary cities.\n\nThe court's decision aligns with a California judge's ruling in October, which found that Section 1373 of the U.S. immigration code, requiring information-sharing between the federal government and sanctuary cities, was a violation of the Tenth Amendment.\n\nUnlike previous sanctuary city cases in California, Ramos' decision affects a wide range of states along the East Coast. Cities in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and Virginia will now be legally allowed to function as havens for asylum-seekers, provided their own state governments allow them to.\n\nIt is worth noting that while some cities under Democratic control have fought to maintain their legal status as sanctuary cities, their commitment to protecting undocumented immigrants and asylum-seekers has been questioned, with police departments (including those in New York City) reportedly working with ICE and federal agencies to detain and deport community members.\n\nThis ruling, however, is significant in Trump's broader war on migrants and refugees, offering a legal victory in the ongoing battle.",
    " Title: U.S. Iran Tensions: Contradictory Messaging and Escalating Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny over its approach to Iran, as high-profile military officials contradict the administration's confrontational strategy and outside experts question the U.S.'s endgame. As bombers recently deployed to the Middle East flew their first message-sending sorties, President Donald Trump appears to be caught between hard-line advisers advocating for more aggressive action against Tehran and others aiming to avoid escalation.\n\nIn a notable departure from the Trump administration, a British general, the No. 2 officer in the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, stated Tuesday that the threat from Iran is no greater than it was months ago, drawing a quick rebuke from the Pentagon. Trump, meanwhile, dismissed a report he is planning to send additional troops to the Middle East but also insisted he would do so \"absolutely\" if needed.\n\nThe escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran began this month, with National Security Advisor John Bolton announcing that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships were steaming to the region ahead of schedule. A group of bombers was also dispatched, with Bolton citing increasing alarm over threats to the thousands of U.S. troops in the region.\n\nThe next day, Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers noted \"indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against U.S. forces and our interests.\" Ominously, the Pentagon announced the bombers were B-52s, warplanes first flown during the Cold War but updated with an arsenal of sophisticated weaponry that can be launched from a safe distance at targets inside Iran.\n\nTwo days after Bolton's announcement, Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the military had detected \"credible threat streams emanating from the regime in Iran throughout the CENTCOM area of responsibility.\" By the end of the week, the Pentagon announced it was bolstering the force, sending a Marine transport ship, the USS Arlington, and Patriot air-defense missiles to the region.\n\nMeanwhile, senior military officials, including Patrick Shanahan, the acting Defense Secretary, met quietly on Thursday to develop plans to send as many as 120,000 U.S. troops to the region, according to the New York Times. Trump offered somewhat contradictory statements Tuesday. Asked about the New York Times report that the administration was considering sending 120,000 troops, the president said no such plans are in the works.\n\nHowever, in the next breath, he ratcheted up his anti-Iran rhetoric. \"Would I do that?\" Trump said of troops. \"Absolutely,\" he said, if the administration decided to deploy soldiers to the region, he said, \"we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that.\" Hours later, British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, the No. 2 officer in Operation Inherent Resolve, told Pentagon reporters the threat from Iran was, in fact, not higher than it was months ago. His comments were at odds with U.S. officials, and Capt. Urban, the spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement that Ghika is wrong.\n\nMichael O' Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned against reading too much into the apparent disagreement between coalition officials. \"A threat includes intent to pull the trigger, not just capability \u2013 not just more preparatory activity,\" he said. \"So until the trigger is, in fact, pulled, one can have a full and rich debate.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was traveling in Russia on Tuesday, appeared to tamp down escalating tensions. \"We fundamentally do not see a war with Iran,\" Pompeo said when asked about the New York Times report during a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said the U.S. wants Iran to stop funding terrorist groups and \"behave like a normal country.\"\n\nA senior Iranian official warned Tuesday that the U.S. is playing a \"very dangerous game\" and suggested Trump could \"drag Iran into an unnecessary war.\" Hamid Baeidinejad, Iran's ambassador to the United Kingdom, said Trump made a \"serious miscalculation\" in deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers, and other military personnel and equipment to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged, unspecified Iranian threats. Baeidinejad denied that Iran or its \"proxies\" were behind what Washington described as the \"sabotage\" of oil tankers in the Gulf belonging to Saudi Arabia, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"We are prepared for any eventuality,\" Baeidinejad said. \"This I can tell you.\"",
    " Title: Journalist Andy Ngo Attacked by Antifa Activists During Portland Protest\n\n Article:\n\nPhotojournalist and editor at Quillette, Andy Ngo, was admitted to the emergency room following an attack by a mob of antifa activists during a Saturday afternoon demonstration in Portland. The assailants, who were wearing black clothing and masks, were counter-protesting several right-wing groups, including the Proud Boys.\n\nNgo, a well-known chronicler of antifa activity, has criticized their illiberal tactics on Fox News. He attended the protest in his capacity as a journalist, covering a notable public event. According to Ngo, his attacker stole his camera equipment. Video footage recorded by another journalist, The Oregonian's Jim Ryan, clearly shows an antifa activist punching Ngo in the face, and others throwing milkshakes at him.\n\nMilkshakes thrown at political figures, particularly those on the right, has been a tactic used by progressive activists in the United Kingdom. U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was hit with one earlier in June. The tactic has its defenders in mainstream left-of-center media as well, with Vox's Carlos Maza tweeting \"milkshake them all\" after a British activist hurled a milkshake at Nigel Farage.\n\nPortland police have claimed that some of the milkshakes thrown by the antifa activists on Saturday contained quick-dry cement. The veracity of this claim is unavailable. What is clear is that an antifa mob attacked a journalist\u2014one who is critical of them, but who posed no physical threat and was only there to document their activities\u2014on a public street. This is indefensible.\n\nAntifa, of course, rejects the notion that violence should only be used in response to a physical threat. The group believes that the very existence of far-right people, groups, and ideas justifies violence\u2014against the far-right, and against their enablers. For more information about the ideology, tactics, and goals of the movement, order Andy Ngo's new book, \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump,\" which includes an entire chapter on antifa.\n\nNgo could not be reached for comment at the time of this article's publication. A disoriented and clearly injured Ngo posted to his Twitter page, but the content of the post is unavailable.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler Calls for Unredacted Mueller Report, Questions Attorney General Barr's Summary\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) has called for the release of the full report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller without any redactions, stating that there could be information in the report that could provide grounds for impeachment or other actions.\n\nDuring an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Mr. Nadler expressed skepticism towards Attorney General William Barr's recent summary of the report, labeling him a \"biased defender\" of the Trump administration.\n\n\"We are demanding and we have a right, the Congress has a right to the entire report with no redactions whatsoever so we can see what's there,\" Mr. Nadler said.\n\nThe Justice Department has indicated that every page of Mr. Mueller's final report on Russian interference in the 2016 election could contain confidential grand jury information, and Mr. Nadler acknowledged that lawmakers may have to go to court to secure those parts.\n\nRegarding the contents of the report, Mr. Nadler said, \"Who knows? There could be grounds for impeachment. There could be grounds for other action. You can commit shameful acts. You can commit complete betrayals of the public interest without committing impeachable acts. And if you did that, the public ought to know that, too.\"\n\nIn a four-page summary of the report, Mr. Barr said last month that it did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia. The summary also stated that the report did not conclude the president obstructed justice after the fact, but that it also did not exonerate him.\n\nMr. Nadler expressed skepticism towards Mr. Barr's summary, stating, \"I dismiss what he said - he's a biased defender of the administration. He's entitled to be a defender of the administration, but he is not entitled to withhold the evidence from Congress.\"\n\nRudolph Giuliani, who is part of the president's legal team, later on the program questioned Mr. Nadler's comments. \"I didn't appreciate his suggestion the attorney general be biased,\" Mr. Giuliani said, calling Mr. Barr a man of the \"highest integrity.\"\n\nMr. Giuliani also expressed a lack of concern that the full report could be damaging for Mr. Trump, despite recent news reports that indicated members of Mr. Mueller's team have expressed concerns about how Mr. Barr framed the primary conclusions of the report.\n\n\"I guarantee you, other than little quibbles, I'm not worried about the report at all,\" Mr. Giuliani said.",
    " Title: Hurricane Sandy's Impact on the 2012 Presidential Election: Five Key Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing approach of Hurricane Sandy has led to a temporary halt in political campaigning on the East Coast, but behind the scenes, political professionals are contemplating the potential effects of the storm on next Tuesday's elections. Campaign officials are reluctant to discuss the political implications of a storm that has yet to make landfall, citing the need to prioritize safety and well-being over political considerations.\n\nHere are answers to five questions about Hurricane Sandy's impact on the election:\n\n1. How might Hurricane Sandy affect the election?\nIt is challenging to envision a scenario where the storm benefits the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. Romney has regained ground in national polls in recent weeks, but his gains have not been mirrored in the crucial states of Ohio and Virginia. Already, Romney had to cancel a full day's worth of events in Virginia on Sunday. President Obama, who is not trying to make up ground, has also had to adjust his schedule. While there are varying opinions on how the storm might influence voters' feelings about the candidates or voter turnout, it is difficult to see how the storm could help Romney, unless the government's response is perceived as inadequate, leading voters to blame President Obama.\n\n2. Does President Obama have a natural advantage due to his position as president?\nYes, but only if he avoids unforced errors. The response to Hurricane Katrina by President George W. Bush is often cited as one of the worst blunders in modern presidential history, but it has also ensured that no president or candidate will under-react to the threat of a devastating natural disaster. As president, Obama's best politics are to simply perform his duties competently. On Sunday, he visited the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters for a briefing, an event prominently featured on the White House website.\n\nThe following questions and their answers will be continued in subsequent articles. Stay tuned for more insights on the potential impact of Hurricane Sandy on the 2012 presidential election.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Investigation: Understanding the Implications for Donald Trump and His Associates\n\nArticle:\n\nA grand jury, a powerful investigative tool in the United States, has been convened by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of an investigation into potential coordination or collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. Here's what you need to know about grand juries and their implications for the Trump administration.\n\nGrand juries are typically composed of 16 to 23 members of the public, as opposed to the usual 12 jurors in a trial jury. They are held in secret, and the fact that one has been established is not officially acknowledged. The Wall Street Journal reported that a grand jury has been set up in Washington by Mueller to investigate links between the Trump team and Russia to influence the White House election and any subsequent attempts to obstruct justice.\n\nThe grand jury's primary function is to determine whether a case is strong enough to proceed with an indictment. It can subpoena witnesses and demand the production of documents, making it a potent investigative tool. Notable figures such as Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton have testified before grand juries in the past. Donald Trump Jr., the president's son-in-law, and White House adviser Jared Kushner could potentially be called to testify over their controversial June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.\n\nWitnesses are questioned under oath for hours, with investigators hoping to catch them in lies or perjury. Unlike in ordinary courts, witnesses are not allowed to have lawyers present during their testimony. Witnesses must leave the court to consult with their lawyers sitting outside, and grand juries are characterized by the time-consuming act of witnesses going in and out.\n\nMueller, appointed special counsel in May following the dismissal of FBI director James Comey, has been investigating since May whether members of the Trump team have lied about links to Russians and whether Trump himself tried to obstruct justice. As of yet, no subpoenas have been received by the president or Kushner.\n\nThe grand jury process can be lengthy, often running for months or even years. Trump has repeatedly dismissed reports about links to Russia as \"fake news.\" At a rally in West Virginia, he stated, \"They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story.\"\n\nThe exact timeline for the grand jury's decision on whether criminal charges should be brought is unavailable. However, it is important to note that the existence of a grand jury does not necessarily imply that charges will be brought against the president or his associates. The grand jury's role is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to move forward with an indictment.",
    " Title: Acquittal vs. Exoneration: The Differences in Trump's Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Avlon, a CNN senior political analyst, has stated that the acquittal of President Donald Trump in the Senate does not equate to exoneration in an impeachment trial. The President's survival of impeachment is not a cause for celebration, as his actions are likely to be a permanent part of his presidential legacy.\n\nUnlike the impeachments of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, this impeachment was not about obscure offenses such as violating the \"tenure of office act\" or lying under oath about an affair. Instead, it was about foreign interference in elections, a concern the Founding Fathers held in high regard.\n\nThe President's legal team, including Michael Purpura, argued that the President did nothing wrong, and that the evidence presented by the House managers exonerated him. However, this claim was not supported by facts, as even Fox News' Steve Doocy acknowledged something was amiss when he first heard about the call between Trump and the leader of Ukraine in September.\n\nBy the end of the trial, several Republican senators admitted that Trump's conduct was wrong, and the evidence did not exonerate him. The Democrats had proven their case, but most Republican senators settled on the argument that Trump's conduct was \"improper but not impeachable.\"\n\nThe President was caught trying to pressure a foreign power to dig up dirt on a domestic political rival and then cover it up. This behavior goes against the principles outlined in the Founding Fathers' writings, such as George Washington's Farewell Address, which states that foreign influence is a \"baneful foe\" of republican government.\n\nThe Trump team's arguments that an impeachable offense requires a crime to be committed, that abuse of power is not a legitimate cause for impeachment, and that obstruction of Congress is an absurd charge, have been refuted by the Founding Fathers' writings and historical precedent.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that an elegant solution to this political impasse would have been to censure the President, but this was dismissed by some senators. The article also highlights Mitt Romney's speech as a reminder of the importance of principles over party loyalty and the need for moral courage in a functioning democracy.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes Sanctions on China over Uighur Muslim Repression\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed legislation on Wednesday that imposes sanctions on those responsible for the repression of Uighur Muslims in China's far western region of Xinjiang. The bill, which passed the U.S. Congress with a single 'no' vote, aims to send a strong message on human rights by mandating sanctions against those involved in the oppression of China's Muslim minority.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that over one million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang, which China claims are vocational skills training centers and necessary to combat extremism. China's foreign ministry described the U.S. law as a \"malicious attack.\"\n\n\"We again urge the U.S. side to immediately correct its mistakes and stop using this Xinjiang-related law to harm China's interests and interfere in China's internal affairs,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"Otherwise, China will resolutely take countermeasures, and all the consequences arising therefrom must be fully borne by the United States.\"\n\nTrump issued a \"signing statement\" alongside the law, stating that some of the sanctions' requirements might limit his constitutional authority as president to conduct diplomacy, so he would regard them as advisory rather than mandatory. Trump did not hold a ceremony to mark his signing the bill into law, which came as U.S. newspapers published excerpts from a new book by his former national security adviser, John Bolton.\n\nAmong other allegations in the book, Bolton said Trump spoke approvingly of Chinese President Xi Jinping's explanation of \"why he was basically building concentration camps\" to intern Uighurs during a G20 meeting in Osaka in 2019 that was attended only by interpreters. Bolton wrote that the U.S. interpreter said that Trump spoke approvingly of the camps. Bolton added that he had also been told by Matt Pottinger, a National Security Council official who is hawkish on China, that Trump had said something similar during a 2017 trip to China.\n\nThe Uighur law calls for sanctions on Xinjiang's Communist Party secretary, Chen Quanguo, who is also a member of the powerful Politburo, for \"gross human rights violations.\" It also calls on U.S. companies with operations in Xinjiang to take steps to ensure their supply chains are free from forced labor.\n\nThe World Uyghur Congress, one of the main Uighur exile groups, welcomed Trump's move to sign the bill into law, saying \"it gave hope to the desperate Uighur people.\"",
    " Title: Pelosi Defends Whistleblower Rights, Spars with Journalist James Rosen\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) engaged in a heated exchange with journalist James Rosen of Sinclair Broadcast Group over the issue of whistleblower anonymity.\n\nRosen, who previously worked for Fox News, asked Pelosi, \"I wonder if you could explain to the American people why the legal rights of the whistleblower should prevail in this political setting over those of President Trump, who should ordinarily enjoy a right to confront his accuser.\"\n\nIn response, Pelosi, visibly tense, pointed at Rosen and said, \"I'll say to you, Mr. Republican Talking Points, what I said to the president of the United States: When you talk about the whistleblower, you're coming into my wheelhouse.\" She then detailed her extensive legislative experience in intelligence matters, stating, \"I have more experience in intelligence than anybody in the Congress, anybody that's ever served, 25 years on the committee as top Democrat, ex officio, as Speaker and leader. I was there when we wrote the whistleblower laws.\"\n\nPelosi continued, \"The whistleblower is there to speak truth to power and have protection for doing that. And any, any retribution or harm coming to a whistleblower undermines our ability to hear truth about power. So, I will defend the rights of the whistleblower vehemently, vehemently.\"\n\nWhen Rosen pressed further, Pelosi responded that President Trump can make his case before those overseeing impeachment proceedings, adding, \"The president is not above the law, the president will be held accountable, and nobody should have the right to endanger whistleblowers, and that is the system that I will defend, and the American people understand that.\"\n\nThe exchange between Pelosi and Rosen has sparked debate on social media, with some commenters criticizing Pelosi's response. Rosen reportedly described the interaction as tense and stated that Pelosi \"attacked\" him and resorted to \"personal disparagement\" in response to his question.\n\nA number of commenters on Rosen's tweet were critical of Pelosi, with some suggesting that she resorted to personal attacks when faced with questions she did not want to answer. However, others defended Rosen and Pelosi, stating that the question was valid and should have been asked.\n\nThe exchange between Pelosi and Rosen is the latest development in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The whistleblower's complaint, which sparked the inquiry, remains at the center of the controversy.",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Demographic Challenges as Minority Voters Grow\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is grappling with the growing influence of minority and younger voters, according to political analysts and party leaders. Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, stated that the issue of demographic change is no longer just important but essential for the party.\n\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Asian-Americans made up 3% of the electorate, up from 2% in 2008, and voted for President Barack Obama by about 47 percentage points. The Republican Party increasingly relies on older white voters, but voters do not necessarily grow more conservative as they age. In the 2012 election, Mr. Obama managed to win a second term despite winning only 39% of white voters and 44% of voters older than 65, according to exit polls by Edison Research.\n\nWhite men made up only about one-quarter of Mr. Obama's voters. In the House of Representatives next year, for the first time, white men will make up less than half of the Democratic caucus.\n\nMark McKinnon, a former strategist for George W. Bush, stated that the Republican Party needs messages and policies that appeal to a broader audience. He said, \"This election proved that trying to expand a shrinking base ain't going to cut it. It's time to put some compassion back in conservatism. The party needs more tolerance, more diversity, and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.\"\n\nThe Republican Party may soon find ways to appeal to minorities and younger voters, but the immediate question for the party is how to improve its image with voters it is already losing in large numbers. Corey Stewart, a Republican who is chairman of the Board of County Supervisors in Prince William, stated that the changes are stark, and the minority population is increasing, while the white population is stagnant.\n\nMr. Stewart, who is running for lieutenant governor next year, drew some criticism in 2007 by pushing for local crackdowns by the police on illegal immigrants. That has cost him support among many Hispanic voters in the county, but he says it helped him politically among blacks who felt threatened economically by the surge of newcomers.\n\nThe biggest challenge for Republicans may be among Hispanic voters, given their numbers. Mr. Obama's victories in Colorado, Nevada, and Virginia came in part because Hispanics turned out in droves and voted Democratic. In Colorado, 14% of the voters were Hispanic, and Mr. Obama won three-fourths of them. In Florida, Hispanic voters were almost one-fifth of the electorate, and Mr. Obama won about three-fifths of them.\n\nCardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a loyal supporter of Mitt Romney's, says his party would never earn their support until it found a new way to address illegal immigration. \"We need to check off that box; we need to get immigration reform done in 2013,\" he said. \"We need to show that Republicans are willing to sit at the table and reach a compromise that is in keeping with what the Hispanic community wants and needs.\"\n\nEven that issue brings risks, though, because any immigration bill that passed in 2013 would be signed by and associated with a Democratic president. The harder challenge for Republicans will be developing proposals that minority and younger voters associate with the party\u2014and support.\n\nIn Prince William, the Hispanic population tripled from 2000 to 2010, much of it along the Route 1 corridor in Dale City. But Tom Davis, who used to represent Dale City as a Republican member of Congress, said that the problem for his former colleagues goes beyond just Hispanic outreach. The party's coalition is contracting, not expanding, he says. It has to find a way to broaden its reach, in part by finding more minority and female candidates to run under the Republican banner, Mr. Davis argues. And he said the outreach had to be real: \"It's not just putting them into the photo-ops at the convention.\"\n\nRepublicans like Mr. Davis\u2014and some inside Mr. Romney's campaign\u2014are quick to point out that the election this week was close, not a blowout. Mr. Davis said that it was \"not time to panic\" for Republicans. But he said Republicans must be honest with themselves about the future. \"It is time to sit down practically and say where are we going to add pieces to our coalition,\" he said. \"There just are not enough middle-aged white guys that we can scrape together to win. There's just not enough of them.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Job Market Recovery Remains Slow, Leaving Millions on the Sidelines and Complicating Fed's Policy Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market recovery is progressing at a slow pace, leaving an increasing number of Americans on the sidelines and posing challenges for Federal Reserve policy makers as they consider when the economy can manage with less stimulus. In August, employers added 169,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department, with the unemployment rate falling to 7.3%, the best mark of the recovery. However, beneath these positive numbers lies evidence of a job market that is moving at a slow pace.\n\nThe government revised down its estimate for June and July hiring by a combined 74,000 jobs, and a disproportionate share of the jobs being added are in low-paying sectors such as restaurants and retail. At the current rate of hiring, the economy will not reach pre-recession levels of employment, adjusting for population growth, for more than eight years.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell not because people found jobs but because they stopped looking. The number of people reporting they had jobs\u2014a measure based on a separate survey from the one used to calculate payroll gains\u2014fell by 115,000 in August. As a share of the population, fewer Americans are working or looking for work than at any time in the past 35 years.\n\nPatrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick LLP, an accounting and advisory firm, stated, \"There is little evidence that the overall economy is accelerating.\" He added, \"Even with these incremental improvements, the recovery remains subpar.\"\n\nAugust's job numbers suggest the recovery is not gaining strength, which may complicate the Fed's plans for tapering its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program meant to stimulate growth. Many private-sector economists had been expecting the pullback to begin at the Fed's September policy meeting, and such a move remains possible. However, job growth has remained steady, and the unemployment rate continues to fall.\n\nEric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., said, \"I don't think it truly tilts the balance away from the Fed starting to dial back bond buying in September. But it's no longer the slam dunk that it would have been.\"\n\nAugust's lackluster report stands in contrast with other recent signals that the economy is gaining momentum. Both the manufacturing and service sectors are expanding, exports have held up despite weak growth overseas, and the housing market is mending, although rising mortgage rates may curb activity. Car sales recently surpassed their pre-recession levels, and broader measures of spending and confidence suggest consumers were relatively unfazed by early-2013 obstacles such as higher taxes and gas prices and the federal budget cuts known as the sequester.\n\nFriday's Labor Department snapshot contained some encouraging details. Average hourly earnings and hours worked both climbed, after falling in July. Local governments, which slashed jobs during the recession and early in the recovery, added workers for the fifth time in six months. Full-time employment increased, and the number of workers stuck involuntarily in part-time jobs fell sharply.\n\nHowever, these positive signals were overshadowed by the continued exodus from the American labor force. The share of the population that is working or looking for work\u2014a measure known as the participation rate\u2014fell to its lowest level since 1978. The decline in labor-force participation reflects, to some degree, long-term trends such as an aging population and increased rates of college attendance. However, much of the recent decline has been driven by the weak economy.\n\nNearly a million Americans say they have given up looking for work because they do not believe they can find a job, and millions more say they would like to work but are not actively searching. August was the 40th consecutive month in which more unemployed workers left the labor market than found jobs.\n\nWhen\u2014and if\u2014these workers will return to the labor force is one of the most significant questions for both short-term economic policy and long-term economic growth. Economists increasingly fear that many of the labor-force dropouts may be gone for good. Hundreds of thousands more workers are receiving federal disability benefits than before the recession, and research shows many employers will not even consider hiring the long-term jobless. However, much of the decline in the labor force has been among younger workers, many of whom are likely to return to work if hiring picks up.\n\nSo far, there is little sign of that happening. More than 4 million Americans have been out of work for more than six months, and their odds of finding a job have barely improved in the past two years, even as prospects have improved for the more recently unemployed.\n\nPhilip Hasskarl, a 61-year-old Haverhill, Mass. resident, has spent much of the past three years looking for work. He finally found a job last year, only to lose it in February when his employer cut the company sales force to 14 people from 50. He said he recently had three interviews and remains optimistic, but has little doubt that his age is making it harder to find work.\n\nMr. Hasskarl, who trained people to sell medical devices, said giving up is not an option. He and his wife \"burned through whatever I had set aside for retirement just to keep the house,\" he said.\n\nMost experts attribute the subdued pace of hiring to lackluster economic growth, which has given companies little reason to add workers. \"There has not been enough duration of strong economic growth for companies to choose to shift hiring into a higher gear on permanent employees,\" said Carl Camden, chief executive of temporary-staffing firm Kelly Services Inc. \"I'm already hearing\u2026customers wondering when the next recession is going to hit.\"\n\nFor other companies, the recession never ended. Jay Lunt, owner and president of Folkers Window Co. in Pensacola, Fla., said real estate \"hasn't recovered at all\" on Florida's Gulf Coast. As a result, Mr. Lunt, whose company installs doors and storm shutters, has no plans to add to his workforce of 23 full-time employees.\n\n\"The bottom line is when the customers are not out there to buy your product, there's no reason for expansion,\" he said. \"When people start spending money\u2026we gear up to address that.\"",
    " Title: Over 1,900 Children Separated from Parents at U.S. Border in Late April and May\n\nArticle:\n\nNearly 2,000 children were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border in the company of their parents between April 19 and May 31, according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday. A total of 1,995 juveniles traveling with 1,940 parents or guardians were detained during this period, the department reported.\n\nThe children have become a contentious issue in the ongoing immigration debate, with Democrats and some Republicans in Congress expressing disapproval of the separations. In response, DHS officials stated they feel compelled to enforce the law more stringently due to the new zero tolerance policy.\n\nA DHS official also disputed a CNN report that quoted an immigration lawyer claiming a mother's baby was taken from her while she was nursing. CNN did not name the mother making the allegation, and DHS said they have been unable to verify the incident.\n\n\"We do not separate babies from adults,\" the official said, refuting the report. \"We believe that [report] is false.\"\n\nThe official also criticized a television host who compared immigration authorities to Nazis, stating that such comparisons were disrespectful to law enforcement officers enforcing the law. The official did not name the person but several on-air personalities have made such comparisons.\n\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough, for example, stated on Thursday that parents are being told their children are being \"taken off to the showers,\" and then separated. \"And they never return,\" he said. On Friday, MSNBC figures Stephanie Cutter compared the detention facilities to \"concentration camps,\" and Michael Steele warned viewers that \"your kids could be next.\"\n\nThe DHS official who briefed reporters said immigration officers and agents deserved better treatment.\n\n\"For someone sitting in a studio to go on air and call them Nazis for doing their jobs, as called for by the laws Congress passed, it's really disgusting,\" the official said. \"We'll be waiting for that apology.\"",
    " Title: Marijuana Legalization: A Growing Industry and Ongoing Debate in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nThe legal marijuana industry in the United States is experiencing unprecedented growth, with projections indicating a 30% increase in sales this year, 45% in 2018, and a cumulative 300% growth between 2016 and 2021, reaching an estimated $17 billion market, according to Marijuana Business Daily's \"Marijuana Business Factbook 2017.\" This growth has attracted significant investment to the sector.\n\nHowever, the federal government maintains a Schedule I classification for marijuana, regarding it as having no recognized medical benefits and being illegal, similar to LSD and heroin. The debate over marijuana legalization persists, with arguments for and against it.\n\nHere are three reasons why legalization makes sense, followed by three reasons for maintaining marijuana as a Schedule I drug:\n\n1. Public Support: Polls consistently show a majority of the public supports marijuana legalization. Gallup's October 2016 poll and CBS News' April 2017 poll found 60% and 61% support, respectively, for legal marijuana nationwide. A separate poll from Quinnipiac University in April 2021 found 94% support for legalizing medical cannabis, compared to 5% who opposed the idea.\n\n2. Potential Health Benefits: Clinical data suggests marijuana has demonstrated positive benefits in university-run and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved studies. For instance, a study published in the American Public Health Association this past week found that since Colorado legalized recreational cannabis, the percentage of opioid-related deaths has decreased by 6.5%. This halted a 14-year trend of increasing opioid-related deaths in the state. The study suggests marijuana may serve as an alternative to pain-fighting opioids, offering a safer option.\n\n-Additional information regarding the three reasons for maintaining marijuana as a Schedule I drug was not provided in the source text. For a balanced perspective, it is essential to consider both arguments for and against marijuana legalization. Further research or additional sources may be necessary to provide a comprehensive view of the debate.",
    " Title: Carson Takes Lead in Republican Presidential Race in Latest CBS/New York Times Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican presidential race has experienced a significant shift in the latest CBS/New York Times poll, with Ben Carson now leading Donald Trump and the Republican field. Carson received 26 percent of the vote, while Trump earned 22 percent. Although Carson's lead is within the margin of error, this marks a notable change in longstanding trends.\n\nTrump, who has been the frontrunner for several months, appears to have lost ground to Carson, particularly among key demographics such as evangelicals. The CBS report highlights Carson's advantages:\n\nCarson has made gains across many key Republican groups. In a reversal from earlier this month, he now leads Trump among women and is running neck and neck with him among men. Carson's support among evangelicals has risen, and he now leads Trump by more than 20 points with this group. Carson performs well among conservative Republicans and those who identify as Tea Partiers.\n\nThe reasons for Carson's rising support among men and Tea Partiers, relative to Trump, are not entirely clear. Tea Partiers are known for their negative approach to politics, and neither Carson nor Trump have any discernible policy platforms. However, their status as outsiders with no political experience, who aim to disrupt the status quo, resonates with conservative men and Tea Partiers.\n\nOne notable difference between the two candidates is that Trump is more aggressive and obnoxious than Carson, while Carson presents a more unhinged, nice-guy persona. This approach is illustrated in Carson's new campaign ad, which hits all the right conservative notes without offering any concrete policy proposals.\n\nIn the 30-second TV spot, Carson promises to balance the budget, secure the border, and put aside partisanship, but offers no specifics on how he plans to accomplish these goals. This empty rhetoric appears to be enough for Republican voters, as both Carson and Trump appeal to the base by bashing the \"political class\" and promising to fix everything that's broken.\n\nOne interesting finding in the new CBS/NYT poll is that 55 percent of Trump backers say their support is firm, while 80 percent of Carson supporters say they could change their minds. This suggests that Carson may be more of a \"flavor of the month\" candidate than Trump, who has proven to have real staying power.\n\nCarson's boost in the polls will undoubtedly benefit his campaign, but his long-term viability remains debatable. If this trend continues for another month or two, however, Trump might face real challenges. Carson may win in Iowa, thanks to his support among evangelicals, but the GOP's last two Iowa winners \u2013 Santorum and Huckabee \u2013 lost the nomination. Trump, on the other hand, is well-positioned in other early primary states like New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he remains comfortably ahead of Carson.",
    " Title: Fox News Poll Shows Decline in President Trump's Approval Rating, Sparks Controversy Among Supporters\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent Fox News poll, which was shared on social media by the news organization, revealed a decline in President Donald Trump's approval rating. The poll indicated that 40% of Americans approve of Trump's job performance, down from 45% in the previous month. Additionally, 53% of respondents stated that Trump's agenda is coming apart, while 44% believe he is shaking up Washington.\n\nThe poll also showed that 68% of Americans approve of the Department of Justice naming a special counsel, while 29% disapprove. However, the release of the poll results sparked a wave of angry responses from Trump supporters, who accused the news organization and polling in general of being biased and inaccurate.\n\nMany of the responses on Twitter attacked the poll, Fox News, and the media in general, with some tweets stating, \"The way Fox is headed. This poll is wrong. I talk to people from all over the US everyday. Trump is still tops. No one unhappy. All cool.\" Another tweet read, \"You just don't get it... We do not believe any b.s. polls you media types hail. Don't care, don't believe them, move on.\"\n\nDespite the backlash, it is important to note that the Fox News poll surveyed more than 1,000 people with a 3-point margin of error. In the last two days, other polls have shown similar results, with Gallup reporting Trump's job approval at 39%, Quinnipiac at 37%, Economist at 40%, and Reuters at 37%. The exception is Rasmussen, which puts Trump's approval at 48%.\n\nThe \"everyone-I-talk-to\" argument made by some Trump supporters betrays a lack of understanding of how scientific polling works. It is important to note that the final Fox News poll before the 2016 election gave Hillary Clinton a 4-point lead, overstating her margin, but Clinton won the popular vote. Trump is president because he won key Electoral College battlegrounds.\n\nThe troubling thing here is that we no longer agree on a common set of facts. Conservatives and liberals are increasingly in their own silos, turning to their own opinionated media sources and constructing their Facebook and Twitter feeds the same way. If everything is fake news, then the role of news in fostering intelligent debate is decimated. And it is not necessary to rely on a poll to be sure of that.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 220,000 Jobs in June, Unemployment Rate Remains at 4.4%\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 220,000 jobs in June, according to the latest labor statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This figure represents the best showing since February and surpasses analysts' expectations of 174,000 jobs. The number of employed Americans, which set records in February, March, and April, reached another record in June, at 153,168,000. The number of Americans not in the labor force, after four consecutive monthly gains, dropped slightly to 94,813,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate remains at 4.4%. The Economic Policy Institute projects that it could fall to 4.0% by January 2019 if it continues to decline at the same rate it did from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016.\n\nThe labor force participation rate rose 0.1% to 62.8%. The BLS excluded Americans who are retired, students, homemakers, the disabled, and any other individuals who have stopped looking for employment.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady attributed the positive report to the GOP's efforts to roll back regulations. He stated, \"With President Trump in the White House, Republicans have already taken historic steps to roll back damaging regulations that have discouraged investment, dragged down our nation\u2019s productivity, and left too many workers waiting for better employment opportunities. Our action so far is only the beginning.\" Brady added that Republicans plan to improve these numbers by enacting meaningful tax reform.\n\nConservative groups have expressed cautious optimism, with ForAmerica tweeting, \"Had no idea NBC was capable of positive'real news' about Trump administration. Baby steps.\" However, Ed Morrissey of Hot Air notes that Republicans have yet to implement a significant portion of their economic agenda.",
    " Title: U.S. Aid to Iraq Enhances Counterterrorism Efforts, but No Plans for Armed Drone Strikes\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is providing significant aid to Iraq to enhance its counterterrorism efforts, but there are no plans for American-operated armed Predator or Reaper drones to respond to the expanding militant network in Iraq. Iraq's foreign minister has suggested this idea, but Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who is positioning himself to run for a third term and is sensitive to nationalist sentiment at home, has not formally requested such intervention.\n\nThe Obama administration has not received a formal request for U.S.-operated armed drones over Iraq, and there are no plans to divert armed Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions over Iraq, according to Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. Instead, the new lethal aid from the United States includes a shipment of 75 Hellfire missiles, delivered to Iraq last week. These weapons are used with small Cessna turboprop planes for striking militant camps, with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) secretly providing targeting assistance.\n\nIn addition, 10 ScanEagle reconnaissance drones are expected to be delivered to Iraq by March. These drones are smaller cousins of the larger, more capable Predators that used to fly over Iraq. American intelligence and counterterrorism officials claim they have effectively mapped the locations and origins of the Al-Qaeda network in Iraq and are sharing this information with the Iraqis.\n\nThe aid is significant because the Iraqi military, with no air force and limited reconnaissance capabilities, has a very limited ability to locate and quickly strike Qaeda militants as they maneuver in western and northern Iraq. The combination of American-supplied Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, tactical drones, and intelligence, supplied by the United States, is intended to augment that limited Iraqi ability.\n\nThe Obama administration has also given three sensor-laden Aerostat balloons to the Iraqi government, provided three additional reconnaissance helicopters to the Iraqi military, and is planning to send 48 Raven reconnaissance drones before the end of 2014. Furthermore, the United States is planning to deliver the first of the F-16 fighters Iraq has bought in the fall of 2014.",
    " Title: McConnell's Political Evolution: From Centrist to Conservative Senate Leader\n\nArticle:\n\nMitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader from Kentucky, has undergone a significant political transformation throughout his career, reflecting both the evolution of his party and his home state. As a young Republican in a Democratic-leaning state, McConnell was considered a centrist, supporting collective-bargaining rights, and receiving endorsements from local labor groups and The Courier-Journal. However, after his ascension to the Senate, he aligned with the conservative movement that was gaining momentum within the Republican Party.\n\nMcConnell's shift towards conservatism is attributed to the growing appeal of conservative ideologies and the desire to maintain power within the party. He changed his stance on collective-bargaining rights, minimum-wage increases, and abandoned his support for pork-barrel spending projects. McConnell became the head of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm in 1997 and ascended to the deputy post in 2002, paving the way for him to become the Republican leader after Frist stepped aside.\n\nCritics argue that McConnell's political evolution is driven by a desire to maintain power and control, with former Democratic Governor of Kentucky, Steven L. Beshear, stating, \"He has changed his position on any number of issues because he thinks that'll keep him in office and keep him in control of that power.\" Todd Hollenbach, who was unseated by McConnell in 1977, is harsher, saying, \"He's whatever he needs to be for the occasion.\"\n\nWhen asked about his plans if he ascended to majority leader, McConnell expressed a desire to restore the Senate as a chamber of deliberative debate, rather than political theater. However, he acknowledged that maintaining a majority in the Senate could lead to taking politically perilous votes to get bills passed.\n\nMcConnell's legislative achievements include his unsuccessful attempts to block the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, his buyout of tobacco farmers, extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, and support of various First Amendment-related causes. McConnell is often praised for his political acumen, with former adviser to George W. Bush, Karl Rove, describing him as \"an evil genius.\"\n\nKentucky, a state that was ferociously divided during the Civil War, is now a chaotic patchwork of political and cultural regions. McConnell's goal in the upcoming Senate race is to win by washing out the cities with a tidal wave of rural votes, while his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, will need to run up huge advantages in Louisville and Lexington to offset the rest of the state.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Struggles as a Political Candidate Attributed to Personal Style and Campaign Missteps\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has faced criticism from within the party, with many attributing his campaign's perceived struggles to Romney himself. This assessment comes from individuals who know Romney personally and professionally, who argue that while Romney possesses leadership, business, and role model qualities, he is not a natural political candidate in the current political climate.\n\nRomney has been self-critical, acknowledging his role in missteps such as the leaked video where he wrote off 47 percent of Americans as ungovernable and out of reach politically. He has admitted, \"That's not the campaign. That was me, right?\" This self-awareness is a testament to Romney's introspective nature, a trait that his closest confidants believe makes him a more qualified individual than his campaign portrays.\n\nRomney is respected by his staff, works hard on his weaknesses, and is known for his analytical and data-driven approach, stemming from his background in private equity. However, this analytical style and his privileged upbringing seem to be at odds with the current political climate. The economic meltdown of 2008, which many blame on wealthy, Wall Street figures, and Romney's socially stiff demeanor, have raised concerns about his ability to connect with the public in the age of constant web scrutiny.\n\nDespite these challenges, some politicians have overcome innate political limitations to reach the White House, such as George H.W. Bush and Richard Nixon. Romney's advisers have 40 days to present his professional achievements as a strength that outweighs his political performance weaknesses in order to secure his place in the White House.",
    " Title: Senator Rand Paul Expresses Concerns Over National ID Provisions in Immigration Reform Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has expressed concerns over provisions in the recently passed immigration-reform bill that he believes could lead to the creation of a national identification system. The bill, which is expected to be considered by the Senate in June, includes measures such as a strong E-Verify system and a \"photo tool\" aimed at controlling unlawful immigrants' access to unlawful employment.\n\nSenator Paul has voiced his opposition to these measures, stating that they infringe on individual privacy and could potentially lead to a national ID card for all individuals present in the United States, both citizens and noncitizens. He argues that these measures would give the government too much power and could lead to a \"papers please\" culture.\n\nThe senator is particularly concerned about the \"photo tool\" contained in the Interior Enforcement and Employment Verification System title of the bill. This provision allows employers to match the photo on an identity document provided by the employee to a photo maintained by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services database. Senator Paul believes this could potentially lead to a national picture database of all citizens.\n\nThe senator has also expressed opposition to the idea of American citizens being forced to carry around a National Identification Card as a condition of citizenship. He argues that this would infringe on constitutional rights and could lead to government abuse of power.\n\nSenator Paul has vowed to fight to remove the photo tool from the legislation, stating his belief that it will become a national ID. He cites examples of the federal government's history of false positives on the no-fly list and the National Instant Check system for gun buyers as reasons for his concern.\n\nThe senator emphasizes the importance of maintaining the Second and Fourth Amendments, stating that the government's role is to protect citizens' rights, not take them away. He believes that stronger borders can be achieved while respecting constitutional limits and liberties.\n\nSenator Paul serves on the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees.",

The event took place at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino, California. Despite anticipation that the device would be available in time for the holiday season, the Apple Watch will not be released until early next year, with prices starting at $349.\n\nAlongside the Apple Watch, Apple also introduced new additions to its iPhone family. The event saw the launch of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, which Apple CEO Tim Cook described as the biggest advancements in iPhone history. The new phones are thinner than previous versions, feature Retina HD displays, and incorporate an enhanced A8 processor, which is 50 percent more efficient than the A7 processor found on the iPhone 5s and 5c. The phones also mark the debut of Apple Pay, a contactless mobile payment technology. Companies collaborating with Apple on Apple Pay include Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and retailers such as Target and Whole Foods.\n\nTech analysts had hoped that Apple would launch the watch in time for the lucrative holiday season, particularly given Samsung's increased efforts in the smartwatch market. However, consumers should not view the Apple Watch as a replacement for their existing devices, as Cook made it clear during his speech that the watch is designed to work with the iPhone.\n\nThree versions of the watch were unveiled at the event: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition, a high-end version built using 18-karat rose or yellow gold. The watch will be available in two sizes \u2013 38 mm and 42 mm.\n\nThe Apple Watch boasts several unique features, such as its 'Digital Crown' \u2013 a small dial on the side of the device used to navigate through the watch's screens. Other features include a \"taptic engine,\" which subtly vibrates to alert users of messages or notifications, and sensors on the back of the watch to monitor vital signs such as heart rate, supporting Apple's push into health and fitness technology.\n\nApple appears to be emphasizing variety as a core element of its smartwatch strategy, promoting a range of different straps that can be used with the device, from a 'Sport Band' made from Elastomer to a leather quilted leather loop to a stainless steel bracelet.\n\nCharles King, principal analyst of the Hayward, Calif.-based tech research firm Pund-IT, expressed surprise that Apple will not launch its smartwatch until 2015. \"It just doesn't make any sense to me at all,\" he told FoxNews.com. \"If you're going to launch a luxury item weeks before a holiday buying season starts and then tell people that it won't be available in time for the holiday season \u2013 what's the point?\"\n\nKing also noted that some Apple users may face a costly upgrade if they want to use the Apple Watch, as the device only works with iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, 6, or 6 Plus running iOS8, the latest version of Apple's operating system. \"You could be looking at spending $1,000 for a watch and a smartphone,\" he said. \"I am sure that there are plenty of Apple fans who will pay that, but I have trouble seeing it as widely adopted as the iPhone.\"\n\nBoth the new phones come in gold, silver, and space gray. Pricing for the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for a 16GB version, $299 for a 64GB model, and a 128GB version for $399. The iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for a 16GB model, $399 for a 64GB version, and $499 for a 128GB model of the phone. The devices will be available in the U.S. on September 19.",
    " Title: Texas Court Grants Sole Custody to Mother in Controversial Gender Identity Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly publicized family court trial, a Texas jury has decided to grant sole managing conservatorship of a seven-year-old child, James, to Anne Georgulas, a pediatrician, who contends that James is transgender and should be affirmed by allowing him to live as a girl named \"Luna.\" The father, Jeff Younger, argued that James is not transgender and is happy being a boy.\n\nThe trial, which lasted a week, centered around the question of whether James has gender dysphoria and, if so, whether the parents should adopt an \"affirmation\" approach or a \"watchful waiting\" approach. The jury's decision means that Georgulas will have sole decision-making authority over James and his twin brother Jude, while Younger had requested sole managing conservatorship over James.\n\nGeorgulas' witnesses, primarily therapists and counselors, testified that James identified as a girl and wanted to be called \"Luna.\" Younger's witnesses, who were medical professionals, expressed concerns about the dangers of a \"social transition\" and the \"medical transition\" it typically leads to, which includes puberty suppression, cross-sex hormones, and surgical removal of reproductive organs.\n\nThe jury was tasked with answering two questions: whether the current joint managing conservatorship should change to a sole managing conservatorship, and, if so, whether Younger should be the sole managing conservator. The jury answered \"yes\" to the first question and \"no\" to the second, effectively making Georgulas the sole managing conservator.\n\nThe judge is expected to make a final verdict on the details of the new arrangement of the conservatorship on Wednesday. Benjamin Albritton, who compiled a report for the court on the case, had advocated for the \"affirmation\" approach but recommended the court to prohibit Georgulas from initiating a medical transition without approval from Younger. The judge's verdict on Thursday could include Albritton's recommendation and maintain an arrangement similar to the current one.\n\nYounger could appeal the jury's decision, but doing so would be an expensive and time-consuming endeavor that might take a year. By that time, Younger is concerned that James could begin puberty and be treated with puberty blockers.",

The 40-year-old journalist was reportedly killed by ISIS, although the group's claims have yet to be substantiated.\n\nThe administration has expressed its \"appalled\" response to these recent developments. Meanwhile, ISIS has threatened to kill another American in captivity if the U.S. does not halt its airstrike campaign against ISIS in northern Iraq.\n\nFormer CIA Director Mike Morell stated that while the assassination of Foley is a tragic event, it should not deter the U.S. from taking action against the enemy. In fact, Morell suggested that the U.S. should intensify its efforts against ISIS.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) strongly condemned ISIS, stating that the brutal execution of Foley is a clear indication that ISIS has declared war on the United States, the American people, and freedom-loving people everywhere. Rubio expressed concern that President Obama continues to appear unwilling to take necessary action against ISIS despite the evident threat the group poses to the U.S. and its way of life.\n\nPresident Obama is set to hold a press conference today to address the alleged beheading of James Wright Foley and its implications.",

Kennedy. The call, made on November 26, 1963, alerted the reporter to \"some big news\" and instructed him to contact the American Embassy in London.\n\nAccording to the document, penned by former CIA Deputy Director James Angleton, the caller simply stated that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy for \"some big news\" and then hung up. The reporter, who remained unidentified in the report, had never received such a call before, and MI5, Britain's Security Service, described him as a \"sound and loyal person with no security record.\"\n\nFollowing Kennedy's death, the reporter informed the Cambridge police about the call, and the police subsequently notified MI5. The report states that the call was made approximately 25 minutes before the President was shot.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump blocked the release of hundreds of records related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, citing potential harm to national security. He placed these files under a six-month review while releasing 2,800 others to meet a deadline mandated by law.\n\nThe documents that were released show federal agents actively pursuing leads and managing worldwide rumors in the days following the assassination on November 22, 1963. The materials also cast a wide net over various activities of the Kennedy administration, including its covert efforts to destabilize Fidel Castro's government in Cuba.\n\nA CIA spokesperson told Fox News that the agency had released all but 18,000 of its more than 87,000 documents related to the assassination, with the remaining records to be made available. The spokesperson added that some of the withheld documents contained redactions to protect information that, if disclosed, would harm national security, including the names of CIA assets, current and former CIA officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships still relevant to national security today.",
    " Title: GAO Report Concludes President Trump Violated Law in Freezing Ukraine Funds\n\nArticle:\n\nA report released by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on Thursday concluded that President Donald Trump violated a 1974 law when he froze assistance funds for Ukraine last year. The White House has maintained that Trump was acting within his legal authority.\n\nThe decision to freeze military aid appropriated by Congress is at the center of impeachment proceedings against the president, which are currently transitioning from the Democrat-controlled House to the majority-Republican Senate. Democratic lawmakers have accused Trump of abusing his office by withholding hundreds of millions in assistance in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) blocked the Defense Department from spending money designated by Congress on July 25, citing a pending policy decision, according to OMB General Counsel Mark Paoletta. The hold was lifted on Sept. 12. However, the GAO report states that the 1974 law governing budget procedure within the government \"does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.\"\n\nThomas Armstrong, general counsel for the GAO, said, \"Under the Impoundment Control Act, it is illegal for OMB to withhold money that has been appropriated by Congress and signed into law.\" If the White House wants to delay or deny funds, it must first alert Congress.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) asked the GAO to assess Trump's decisions to freeze the Ukraine aid. Van Hollen stated, \"We now have a GAO decision stating conclusively that the Trump administration violated the law. We know the president ordered that violation of law. And it's just all the more important that Republican senators support a fair trial.\"\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) opposes the introduction of fresh witnesses or evidence into a Senate trial, arguing the Senate's role is to assess the House's fact-finding, not to conduct new investigations. Senators are expected to vote on that question, and it is unclear whether there might be sufficient support from enough Republicans to bring in new evidence or witnesses.\n\nAfter the release of the GAO report, the OMB issued a statement disagreeing with the findings. OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel said, \"OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the president's priorities and with the law.\" In a letter to GAO in December, OMB lawyer Paoletta argued that the holdup of the Ukraine aid was a simple \"programmatic delay\" and therefore did not require prior notice to Congress.\n\nHowever, national security online forum Just Security reported in early January that Defense Department emails showed repeated warnings from the department to OMB that the delays put its ability to distribute the aid at risk.",
    " Title: Gillette's New Commercial Challenges Toxic Masculinity: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nGillette, the shaving company, has released a new commercial that addresses the concept of \"toxic masculinity\" and encourages men to behave better towards women and each other. However, the advertisement has sparked controversy among some conservative commentators, who have accused Gillette of promoting cultural Marxism, catering to leftist social priorities, and granting the premises of social justice warriors (SJW).\n\nUpon closer examination of the ad, it becomes clear that these strong claims are exaggerated. The commercial primarily depicts men choosing not to bully each other, harass women, or commit violence. These actions are not necessarily \"leftist social priorities\" and are generally considered undesirable by both conservatives and liberals.\n\nBen Shapiro, a well-known conservative commentator, has criticized Gillette for promoting what he perceives as leftist ideals. However, it is important to note that the ad does not claim that all men are bad or that masculinity is always a dangerous ideal. Instead, it makes a modest call to action: treat people better.\n\nShapiro's criticism of the ad overlooks the importance of promoting respectful behavior and the reduction of violence and harassment. It is true that not all men engage in such behaviors, and it is also true that some women can be abusers. However, the ad does not make collectivist assumptions about men or women.\n\nIn a separate point, Shapiro emphasizes the importance of young men having strong male role models in their lives. He argues that young men should learn from men who treat women well and act as protectors rather than victimizers. Interestingly, this is exactly the message conveyed in the Gillette ad.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may find Gillette's ad controversial, it is important to consider the ad's message in a factual and unbiased manner. The ad does not promote cultural Marxism, leftist social priorities, or the idea that all men are bad. Instead, it encourages men to treat people better, which is a message that can be beneficial for society as a whole. People are free to choose which brands they support, but it is worth questioning whether boycotting companies for promoting respectful behavior is a worthwhile pursuit.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Impact of News Consumption on Mental Health During National Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nAlison Holman, a researcher, was conducting a study on mental health across the United States when the Boston Marathon bombings occurred on April 15, 2013. The tragedy resulted in three deaths, including an eight-year-old boy, and hundreds of injuries, with sixteen individuals losing limbs.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombings, news organizations provided extensive coverage, including footage of the explosion and its aftermath, as well as haunting images of blood-spattered streets, grieving spectators, and visibly shaken victims.\n\nHolman and her colleagues from the University of California, Irvine, found themselves in possession of data about the mental wellbeing of nearly 5,000 people before the tragedy. They decided to investigate if the mental health of the participants had changed in the weeks following the event.\n\nIt was intuitively obvious that being physically present for or personally affected by a terrorist incident would negatively impact mental health. However, the study revealed a surprising twist. Those who had not witnessed the explosion in person but had consumed six or more hours of news coverage per day in the week following the event experienced higher levels of acute stress.\n\n\"It was a big 'aha' moment for us,\" says Holman. \"I think people really strongly, deeply underestimate the impact the news can have.\"\n\nThe study suggests that news coverage is more than a neutral source of facts. It can influence our attitudes, shape our views of foreign countries, and possibly impact the health of entire economies. It can increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. There is also emerging evidence that the emotional fallout of news coverage can affect our physical health, increasing the chances of having a heart attack or developing health problems years later.\n\nCrucially, just a few hours of news consumption each day can have a significant impact beyond what one might expect. The reason for this is not yet fully understood.",
    " Title: Red-State Democrats Face Re-election Challenges After Voting Against GOP Tax Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nOne red-state Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, stated that the GOP did not reach out enough to him on the tax-cut bill, while others said they could not find enough common ground to secure their votes. These Democrats, many of whom face re-election battles next year in states President Trump won by double-digit margins, are hoping voters will not punish them for their votes against the tax bill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin said he had tried to find areas to collaborate with Republicans on the tax bill, but could not do so this time. He expressed concerns about the bill's focus on corporate tax cuts, particularly the permanent nature of these cuts compared to the planned expiration of individual rate reductions.\n\nCongress passed the tax bill without any Democratic support, as they remained in opposition to the package. Several red-state Democrats, however, said they could have been partners on taxes if the GOP had taken a different approach.\n\nRepublican leaders claimed they welcomed Democratic support but said once the minority party's leaders decided to oppose the package, there was little hope for collaboration. After the vote, President Trump said Democrats would have to explain their stance.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Democrats don't like to see tax cutting,\" President Trump said. \"They like to see tax increases. And they like to complain. But they don't get it done, unfortunately. But they complain a lot.\"\n\nWhile President Trump is considered political poison in some blue states, red-state Democrats took pains to say they tried to work with him. Sen. Claire McCaskill, for example, framed her vote against the bill as a disappointment that the plan favored corporations over individuals.\n\nAt a town-hall meeting in Missouri last week, Sen. McCaskill argued the bill betrayed the principles President Trump had originally proposed. However, some voters in her state expressed confusion about her opposition to the bill.\n\nIn Indiana, Sen. Joe Donnelly told his voters he met with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence over the tax bill. He expressed a willingness to partner with Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump administration but noted that the bill produced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan was the opposite of what he and the president had discussed.\n\nIn North Dakota, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who had previously expressed openness to voting for the bill, cited the additional $1.5 trillion in deficits as a reason for her vote against it. However, some voters in her state do not see this as a valid reason for opposition.\n\nDoubling the death tax, a point of contention for Democrats who argue it benefits large corporations rather than farmers, is one aspect of the bill that people in agricultural North Dakota are paying close attention to. Daryl Lies, president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau, expressed support for the bill, stating that the increased deduction for the full purchase of equipment would benefit local farmers. He also noted that crop insurance \"enhanced\" during the time the bill was being debated.",
    " Title: GOP Senators Request Information on Hunter Biden's Business Dealings and Travel Records\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo Republican senators, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), have requested clarification on potential conflicts of interest regarding Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China. The senators sent a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray on Wednesday, inquiring about whether Hunter Biden used government-sponsored travel for private business purposes and seeking details of his travel records.\n\nThe senators' inquiry comes shortly after President Donald Trump's acquittal by the Senate on articles of impeachment related to his conduct in Ukraine. During the impeachment proceedings, Republicans have alleged that Joe Biden, while Vice President, conducted foreign policy to benefit his son's business interests in Ukraine, a claim for which there is no evidence.\n\nThe senators' letter is part of a broader effort by Republicans to shift focus from Trump's actions in Ukraine to the Biden family's business dealings. The claim is that Joe Biden pushed out a former Ukrainian prosecutor to quell an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company for which Hunter Biden served on the board. However, it was Joe Biden's position that the prosecutor was not effective in addressing corruption cases in Ukraine, a view shared by international leaders and anti-corruption groups.\n\nDemocrats have argued that Trump sought investigations to damage Joe Biden in the 2020 election, while Trump's legal team maintained that the president had legitimate reasons for concern.\n\nIn addition to Grassley and Johnson, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also stated his intention to pursue the Bidens, suggesting that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee may call witnesses, including Hunter Biden, to testify about the matter in the coming weeks.\n\nJoe Biden has dismissed all allegations as conspiracy theories but acknowledged that his son's role created a \"bad image.\" In a recent statement, Joe Biden said, \"No one's found anything wrong with his dealings with Ukraine except they say it sets a bad image.\"",
    " Title: USCIS Director Francis Cissna Resigns, to be Replaced by Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Francis Cissna, has resigned from his post on Friday, following a request from President Donald Trump, according to his resignation letter. Cissna will be succeeded by former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, as per a source familiar with the situation.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Cissna emphasized his commitment to enforcing the rule of law and laying the groundwork for effective immigration reform during his tenure. He wrote, \"We are the government servants charged with lawfully, efficiently, and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits, while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our nation\u2019s values.\"\n\nCissna's departure from his post has been in the works for several weeks, as Trump has sought to reshuffle his immigration officials. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Ronald Vitiello, who was acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also left their positions last month. Republican lawmakers had urged the president to retain Cissna, but White House adviser Stephen Miller had sought to remove him for several weeks.\n\nRumors of Cuccinelli's selection to a top immigration post raised eyebrows earlier this week. Cuccinelli led the charge among the Republican National Convention to back Sen. Ted Cruz's nomination in 2016. However, members of Trump's inner circle told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this week that the president had put their past differences aside and has come to admire Cuccinelli.\n\nUSCIS, which oversees legal immigration and traditionally defends it, has been a key element in the hardline crackdown on immigration under the Trump administration and Cissna's leadership. Cissna has overseen the significant reduction of the country's refugee program, the creation of a \"denaturalization task force\" aimed at stripping citizenship from those who committed fraud, and a change in policy to make it easier for visas to be denied.\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine in September, Cissna stated that he was not driven by anti-immigrant sentiment but rather a \"strong commitment to the law, and to the rule of law.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Criticize Obama's Surveillance Program Review, Accuse White House of Reacting to Events\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional leaders have criticized President Obama for his plan to review and potentially alter government surveillance programs, with some lawmakers taking aim at the White House's perceived reaction to the Edward Snowden leaks rather than the programs themselves. The changes proposed by the president on Friday were intended to address concerns that the federal government is eroding Americans' Fourth Amendment rights, but lawmakers argue that the administration has been slow to respond and has failed to explain the lawful programs that have saved lives and stopped terrorist plots.\n\nIn a news conference on Friday, President Obama asked Congress to review portions of the Patriot Act that allow the National Security Agency (NSA) and other agencies to monitor telephone records and gather other forms of data. The depth of these programs was first revealed by Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who was granted asylum in Russia and has been charged with espionage and other offenses by the Justice Department.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the Patriot Act, Mr. Obama also proposed putting privacy advocates in the courtroom to argue against the government's case for search warrants and enhanced snooping efforts. He also called for greater transparency around these programs, an effort to restore skeptical Americans' trust in their leaders.\n\nCritics argue that the administration has fallen into the trap of reacting to events, such as the Snowden leaks, and the public pressure that results. Rep. Peter T. King, a New York Republican and a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the president has been \"silent for the last two months.\"\n\n\"He's allowed the Edward Snowdens and the others of the world to dominate the media, and now we have people who actually think the NSA is spying on people, is listening to our phone calls, is reading our emails,\" Mr. King said.\n\nIn recent weeks, lawmakers' voices have become louder in the larger debate. Rep. James E. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, joined Republicans last month in voting to defund NSA surveillance programs. He said he did so not because he doesn't trust the president but because he thinks Congress must be more involved.\n\n\"The president spoke out on this issue long before Snowden. And I was very comfortable with the president's position on this,\" he said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"It's just that every now and then, you cast a vote in order to let your constituents know, and for your colleagues to know, exactly how you feel about a situation, and sometimes, let the White House know that this is something that we can not allow you to have just a blank check on,\" he said.\n\nMr. Obama's proposed changes have also drawn criticism from outside Washington, including from Edward Snowden's father, Lon.\n\n\"What I've seen is much political theater,\" he said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I was disappointed in the president's press conference. I believe that's driven by his clear understanding that the American people are absolutely unhappy with what they learned. Much of what he suggested is superficial.\"\n\nLon Snowden appeared on the show alongside his attorney, Bruce Fein, and the two confirmed that they have secured visas and will travel to Russia soon to meet with Mr. Snowden.\n\nEdward Snowden's revelations and the national debate they have spawned underscore a deeper problem in American society, some lawmakers say. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he doesn't disagree with any of the reform ideas that the president laid out last week but that efforts also must focus on the broader goal of restoring public confidence in elected leaders.\n\n\"There's a careful balance here between preserving our assets and capabilities and making sure the American people are convinced that their privacy is not being violated,\" Mr. McCain said.\n\n\"Right now, there is kind of a generational change. Young Americans do not trust this government. Without trust in government, you can't do a lot of things.\"\n\nMr. McCain cited the disparate reactions to the Snowden leaks as an example of the generation gap.\n\n\"There's a young generation who believes he's some kind of Jason Bourne,\" he said.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Heading Toward Escalation in Trade Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and China are moving closer to a point where neither side can back down, with President Donald Trump announcing plans to impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese-made products by August 30. The new tariffs, combined with previously announced tariffs of $50 billion, would affect almost half of all goods the U.S. imports from China.\n\nChina has seven weeks to respond or risk escalating the conflict further. President Xi Jinping has vowed to respond in kind, already imposing retaliatory duties on products from states that support Trump, such as Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon. Matching the latest U.S. tariffs would force China to either levy higher tariffs or take more disruptive measures, such as canceling purchase orders, encouraging consumer boycotts, and imposing regulatory hurdles.\n\nTrump has framed his trade actions as necessary to protect American businesses and farmers from harmful trading practices. \"Other countries' trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses,\" Trump said in a Twitter post from Brussels, where he is attending a NATO summit. \"I will open things up, better than ever before, but it can't go too quickly.\"\n\nThe trade conflict has already had an impact on the global economy, with stocks falling and commodities sliding on Wednesday. The S&P 500 Index ended the longest rally in a month, and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated. Economists warn that a full-blown trade war could derail the strongest economic upswing in years.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry has stated that it will retaliate against the U.S. tariffs, and there have been no confirmed high-level talks between the two sides since an early June visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that achieved no breakthroughs. Beijing \"never yields to threat or blackmail\" and will retaliate against the \"groundless\" tariffs, according to China's Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen.\n\nThe trade conflict is expected to feature prominently in November's U.S. congressional elections, and the announcement has exposed fissures between Trump and his Republican Party about the strategy. Some Republican lawmakers have expressed concern about the trade spat with China and the uncertainty it is creating among farmers and businesses.\n\nThe latest move suggests that Trump may be compromising on his pledge to spare consumers from the pain of the trade war. The tariffs could raise the prices of a wide range of consumer products, including baseball gloves, handbags, and digital cameras, just as voters are heading to the polls. Other high-profile items, such as mobile phones, have so far been spared.\n\nThe U.S. has accused China of unfair trade practices and the abuse of American intellectual property, and has rejected Chinese offers to trim its trade surplus by buying more American goods. The Trump administration is demanding more systemic change, such as rolling back China's \"Made-in-China 2025\" program, a signature Xi initiative to dominate several strategic industries.\n\nChina's slowing, trade-dependent economy may not be able to withstand a sustained attack from Trump, which has already weighed heavily on stock prices. China has a million and one ways to retaliate, according to Scott Kennedy, deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
    " Title: House GOP Budget Proposes Pro-Growth, Balanced Spending Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has stated that the new GOP House budget, passed this week, offers opportunities for middle-class families and small businesses to thrive. In a column for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Boehner argued that the budget addresses the problem of spending under President Barack Obama, paves the way for job creation, and institutes a simpler and fairer tax code.\n\nBoehner criticized Obama's proposed budget, stating it includes a 65 percent increase in spending over 10 years, more than $2 trillion in new taxes on working families, and $8.5 trillion in new debt for future generations. He claimed that many middle-class families are currently earning less under Obama's administration, facing high energy prices, rising food prices, and a difficult jobs market.\n\nBoehner emphasized the need for bold new reforms to stimulate economic growth and expand opportunities for all. He highlighted the House's efforts to address the problem of spending directly while also protecting programs like Medicare and Social Security. The House also voted overwhelmingly to replace Medicare's Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula with a system that rewards quality and innovation.\n\nAccording to Boehner, this permanent SGR solution is a significant victory for the American people, marking the first real entitlement reform in decades. He explained that this change will help ensure seniors have access to their doctors, strengthen Medicare, and provide long-term savings for taxpayers.\n\nBoehner concluded by expressing optimism for the House's accomplishments in the first 100 days of 2015 and looking forward to continued progress. He emphasized the House's commitment to listening to the American people and making decisions that benefit the country, rather than taking the easy route.",
    " Title: Manhunt for Berlin Christmas Market Attack Suspect, Anis Amri, Across Europe\n\nArticle:\n\nGerman prosecutors have identified a suspect in Monday's deadly lorry attack on a Berlin Christmas market as Anis Amri, a 23-year-old Tunisian national. Authorities are currently searching for Amri, who is believed to be armed and dangerous. His residence permit was found in the cab of the lorry.\n\nAccording to reports, Amri had been under German surveillance earlier this year on suspicion of seeking to buy guns. The German authorities are offering a reward of up to \u20ac100,000 for information leading to his arrest.\n\nThe attack resulted in 12 deaths, and it is suspected that Amri may have been injured in a struggle with the lorry driver. The German authorities are investigating the incident, with police searching a migrant shelter in the Emmerich area of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Amri's permit was issued.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel has met with her security cabinet to discuss the investigation into the attack. In another development, the German cabinet has approved plans to allow more video surveillance of public places.\n\nAnis Amri reportedly travelled to Italy in 2012 and then on to Germany in 2015, where he applied for asylum and was granted temporary leave to stay in April of this year. Ralf Jaeger, the minister of interior of North Rhine-Westphalia, stated that the claim for asylum had been rejected in June but the papers necessary for deportation had not been ready.\n\nSecurity agencies exchanged their findings and information about this person with the Joint Counter-Terrorism Centre in November 2016. Tunisia had initially denied Amri was its citizen, so the authorities had to wait for temporary passport documentation from Tunisia.\n\nJudicial sources suggest that Amri was monitored in Berlin between March and September on suspicion of planning a robbery to pay for automatic weapons for use in an attack. Sueddeutsche Zeitung reports that the suspect moved within the circle of an Islamist preacher, Ahmad Abdelazziz A, known as Abu Walaa, who was arrested in November.\n\nInvestigators believe the lorry was hijacked on Monday afternoon as it stood in an industrial zone in north-western Berlin. The only confirmed death is that of Polish lorry driver Lukasz Urban, who appears to have fought the attacker before dying of stab and gunshot wounds.\n\nItalian expatriate Fabrizia di Lorenzo, 31, from Sulmona near L'Aquila, is feared dead. It is understood her phone and metro pass were found at the scene. A woman from Neuss, near the west German city of Duesseldorf, is believed to be among the dead while her son, aged 40, is among the injured.\n\nThe German authorities have asked the family of Israeli woman Dalia Elyakim, missing since the attack, for DNA samples to help identify her; her husband Rami was seriously injured. A Spanish student, 21-year-old Inaki Ellakuria, survived the attack with leg injuries. He has been tweeting about his experiences.\n\nThere appears to be evidence that, despite being stabbed, Mr. Urban wrestled his hijacker for the steering wheel. The post-mortem examination suggests that Mr. Urban survived up until the attack and was shot dead when the truck came to a halt. No gun has been recovered.\n\nPolice say they are acting on hundreds of tips from the public and are examining DNA traces from the cab of the truck. The IS group claimed the attack through its self-styled news agency, saying it was \"in response to calls to target nationals of the coalition countries.\"",
    " Title: Job Market Weakens in December, Adding Only 74,000 Jobs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market experienced a significant slowdown in December, with the economy adding only 74,000 jobs, according to the government's report. This is the weakest month for job growth since January 2011 and fell far short of economists' expectations of an additional 193,000 jobs.\n\nFor the entire year of 2013, the economy added 2.2 million jobs, which is on par with 2012's gains. Some economists attribute December's weak job gains to a fluke, citing other strong economic data. They anticipate that the government will revise the numbers higher in the coming months.\n\nTim Hopper, chief economist for TIAA-CREF, stated, \"Just about every other measure of job growth suggests that employers are either hiring or intending to hire, extending hours and laying off fewer people.\" Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, added, \"Let's not panic. It's not a horrible year, all things considered.\"\n\nThe government noted that \"unusually cold weather in parts of the country\" could have impacted construction jobs, as this sector lost 16,000 jobs in December.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell to 6.7% in December, but the decrease was primarily due to workers leaving the labor force. This could indicate that job market dropouts are retiring, enrolling in educational programs, or taking care of relatives. However, many have given up hope of finding work.\n\nOnly 62.8% of the adult population is participating in the labor market now, which matches the lowest level since 1978. In the job market's 2007 heyday, unemployment was under 5%, but in the two years that followed, the recession wiped out 8.7 million jobs. To this day, not all those jobs have returned.\n\nHeidi Shierholz, economist with the Economic Policy Institute, stated, \"We're going to have a long-term unemployment crisis for a long time.\"\n\nSeveral individuals who have been unemployed for an extended period have shared their stories with CNNMoney. Jamie May, a former senior manager for a corporate housing company, has been job hunting for over a year. She has submitted applications for positions around the country and has indicated a willingness to take jobs in the $30,000 to $40,000 range.\n\nFred Royal, a former administrative assistant for a grocery chain, lost his job in March and has received the same message in interviews. \"Many have said they think I will leave for a better paying job,\" he said. \"Better paying job? I can't even get one job.\"\n\nBoth May and Royal were among the 1.3 million Americans who received their final check in federal unemployment benefits last week after Congress agreed on a budget that left out the recession-era program. Democrats are pushing for an extension of the program, but Republicans insist on finding a way to pay for it through cost-cutting elsewhere.\n\nThe ongoing tension between Washington policymakers is exemplified by the haggling over budget cuts versus aid to the still fragile economy. While Congress has focused on reducing government spending, the Federal Reserve has been injecting trillions of dollars into the economy in an attempt to help the job market.\n\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke will end his second term at the central bank later this month without reaching his goal of \"full employment.\" In a speech last week, he blamed part of the problem on government policy, stating, \"Excessively tight near-term fiscal policies have likely been counterproductive.\"\n\nThe federal government has cut 98,000 jobs over the past three years, not including the Postal Service, which is independently funded but has also been slashing jobs. The Postal Service workforce is around its lowest level since the 1960s.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, forecasts it could take until the end of 2016 to get to a 5.5% unemployment rate. Shierholz calculates it could take even longer to get to a pre-recession job market\u2014when unemployment was below 5%.\n\n\"Even if we did have 200,000 jobs a month, we would need five years to get there,\" she said.\n\nAre you unemployed?

    " Title: Super Typhoon Mangkhut Makes Landfall in Guangdong, China, After Wreaking Havoc in Hong Kong, Macau, and the Philippines\n\nArticle:\n\nA powerful super typhoon, named Mangkhut, made landfall in China's Guangdong province on Sunday, the country's most populous province, following destructive impacts in Hong Kong, Macau, and the Philippines. The typhoon, considered the strongest to hit the region this year, has reportedly caused the deaths of potentially more than 50 people in the Philippines.\n\nWith winds exceeding 200 kph (125 mph) at its peak, tropical cyclone Mangkhut surpassed the strength of Hurricane Florence, which reached maximum sustained winds of 150 kph (90 mph) when it struck North Carolina in the United States on Friday. The eye of Mangkhut, named after the Thai mangosteen fruit, skirted approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Hong Kong, but the former British colony was still affected by the typhoon's swirling bands of rain and gale-force winds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the city raised its highest No. 10 typhoon signal as fierce winds uprooted trees, shattered windows in buildings, and caused some structures to sway. Water levels surged 3.5 meters (12 feet) in some areas, and waves flooded roads and threw live fish into residential blocks and a mall in the eastern Heng Fa Chuen district.\n\nIn the Philippines, the reported death toll from Mangkhut's impact could exceed 50, with most fatalities occurring in landslides in or near mountainous areas of the Cordillera region. As of Sunday evening, various agencies reported 33 dead and 56 missing, but the head of the military's Northern Luzon Command, Emmanuel Salamat, stated that at least 19 more were killed in landslides in one part of Benguet province.\n\nIn Macau, which temporarily halted casino gambling late on Saturday, there was significant flooding of up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet), with some people requiring rescue from their homes using rubber dinghies. Around 20,000 Macau households also experienced a power blackout, according to local media.\n\nThe typhoon, known as the \"King of Storms\" by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5 p.m. local time. Ports, oil refineries, and industrial plants in the area have been shut, and power to some areas was reduced as a precaution. In Shenzhen, the electricity supply to more than 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday.\n\nMangkhut is expected to continue its northwesterly track, bringing heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday. The storm is forecast to weaken into a tropical depression when it reaches southwestern Yunnan province in the early hours of Tuesday.",
    " Title: Physician David Nathan Disagrees with David Frum's Stance on Marijuana Legalization for Adults\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent op-ed for CNN.com, conservative political commentator David Frum argued against the legalization of marijuana. However, clinical psychiatrist David Nathan, who shares Frum's concerns about the potential harm of marijuana, particularly for young people and the psychiatrically ill, disagrees with Frum's stance on the drug's legalization for adults.\n\nNathan, who is a father and a physician, believes that the negative legal consequences of marijuana use are far worse than the medical consequences. He argues that by keeping marijuana illegal, dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are also kept illegal, which he considers an unjust and harmful policy.\n\nNathan proposes a different approach, suggesting that marijuana should be legal for adults and regulated like alcohol, with education about the risks provided to children from a young age. He argues that by making marijuana illegal, it has been elevated to a forbidden fruit, making it more attractive to young people.\n\nThroughout his career as a clinical psychiatrist, Nathan has seen lives ruined by drugs like cocaine, painkillers, alcohol, and tobacco. He has also witnessed the devastation caused by marijuana use, but he attributes this not to the drug itself, but to the justice system that chooses to punish users rather than provide education and support.\n\nNathan points out that alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, caffeine, and refined sugar are among the most commonly used, potentially habit-forming recreational substances. He argues that all should be left out of our daily diets, but only marijuana is illegal, while alcohol and tobacco are clearly more harmful.\n\nNathan also argues that the dangers of alcohol, such as pancreatitis, gastritis, cirrhosis, permanent dementia, physiological dependence, and fatal withdrawal, far surpass the dangers of marijuana. He also notes that alcohol causes severe impairment of judgment, which results in violence, risky sexual behavior, and more use of hard drugs.\n\nNathan also argues that the illegal purchase of marijuana exposes consumers to dealers who push hard drugs, while the legal purchase of marijuana could decrease the consumption of more dangerous drugs. He also points out the potential for adulteration of black-market cannabis and the substitution of more dangerous copycat compounds, which can be harmful or even fatal.\n\nNathan concludes that the ban on cannabis was based on bad science and fabricated stories of violence perpetrated under the influence, and that America can fix this mess through marijuana legalization and regulation. He suggests that federal, state, and local governments can regulate the cannabis trade as they do with alcohol and tobacco, monitoring the production process for safety and purity, controlling where it is sold, taxing all aspects of marijuana production and consumption, and redirecting resources from punishment to prevention.",
    " Title: Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign: A Look at the Businessman and Reality TV Star's Political History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential race has attracted a diverse field of major candidates, with Donald Trump standing out among them. On Tuesday, he officially joined the race, two days after his 69th birthday.\n\nDonald Trump, often referred to as \"The Donald,\" is a billionaire real estate developer and television personality. He is known for his signature properties, such as Trump Plaza in Manhattan, golf resorts in Florida, and casinos in Atlantic City. Trump gained national recognition through his successful run as a reality TV star on The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nIn the past, Trump has made forays into national politics. In late 1999, he was among several contenders for the Reform Party nomination, the remnant of the third-party movement begun by billionaire H. Ross Perot in 1992. Trump eventually withdrew from that contest, but in 2008 and 2012, he expressed interest in seeking the Republican presidential nomination. He was a vocal critic of President Obama's policies during those years and appeared frequently with other candidates, such as Sarah Palin.\n\nTrump was a proponent of the so-called birther movement, questioning President Obama's eligibility for the office based on allegations that he was born outside the United States. Despite definitive documents from Obama's birth in Hawaii in 1961, Trump continued to question Obama's birthplace.\n\nTrump was sent to the New York Military Academy at the age of 13 to learn discipline. He later attended Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of finance. Trump initially went into business with his father, a developer of middle-class housing in Queens and other outer boroughs of New York, but he soon shifted his focus to Manhattan and participated in higher-risk, higher-reward projects.\n\nTrump has been drawing about 5 percent among Republicans in some national polls, which would qualify him for the Fox News debate on Aug. 6, featuring the top 10 candidates in an average of national polls. Although his actual net worth has been a matter of dispute, Trump is estimated to be worth $4.1 billion by Forbes magazine.\n\nIn 2000, Trump received 15,311 votes in the California Reform Party primary, 44 percent of the total, despite not campaigning for the primary. Trump's NBC TV show, The Apprentice, was a hit from its introduction in 2004. He has also been a frequent guest on TV talk shows, including The Late Show With David Letterman, and has appeared in TV ads for various products.\n\nTrump's big breakthrough in business came when he was 34, with the acquisition of the old Commodore Hotel near Manhattan's Grand Central Station. Trump and various partners redesigned the hotel as the Grand Hyatt, a major success after extensive restoration of Grand Central itself. He later bought and renovated the iconic Plaza Hotel at the southeast corner of Central Park and the Barbizon at the southwest corner.\n\nTrump has been married three times and has five children. His three children from his first marriage\u2014Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric\u2014are now in their 30s and involved in the Trump Organization businesses. Trump's first marriage to Ivana lasted from 1977 to 1991, and they appeared in Pizza Hut ads together after their separation, joking about how they would split up the pie.",
    " Title: Water Infrastructure Crisis in the U.S. Highlighted by Flint, Michigan Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nThe water crisis in Flint, Michigan, serves as a stark reminder of the fragile state of the nation's water infrastructure. The aging water infrastructure in the United States, which serves over 300 million people through approximately 150,000 public water systems, is riddled with rusting, leaky pipes and outdated plans. If not addressed, this issue could have severe and lasting consequences on numerous communities.\n\nThe Flint crisis, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit's system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure, is a potential precursor to similar situations in other communities. The negligence that led to the contamination of Flint's water supply, exposing families and young children to lead, is alarming.\n\nLead, a harmful compound, has well-documented effects on a developing brain and body. In 1978, a successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law due to the risks associated with lead poisoning from ingesting paint chips. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter in 1991, requiring water supplies to routinely test household tap water for lead levels.\n\nExposure to lead can occur through direct consumption of contaminated water with unsafe levels or indirectly through inhalation of contaminated water particles. Once lead enters the human body, it can accumulate in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys, disrupting their normal cellular biology and potentially leading to chronic diseases. The most significant damage from lead poisoning is inflicted on the brain, particularly in young or unborn children. Lead deposits in a developing fetal brain can cause irreversible damage, resulting in low IQ, severe cognitive delays, memory disruptions, learning disabilities, and other neurological deficits.\n\nThe Obama administration has reportedly appointed Dr. Nicole Lurie to address the crisis in Flint, but efforts should extend beyond Michigan. Lurie and other officials must evaluate other areas of the U.S. where residents are most at risk of a similar disaster. The government's failure to protect Flint underscores the urgent need for action to safeguard other communities.",
    " Title: Professor Vanessa Tyson Accuses Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of Sexual Assault\n\nArticle:\n\nVanessa Tyson, a professor who has accused Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax (D) of sexual assault, issued her first statement Wednesday detailing her allegation against him.\n\n\"What began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault,\" Tyson, a college professor from California, said in the statement. \"Mr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him.\"\n\nTyson has accused Fairfax of sexually assaulting her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax has denied the accusation.\n\nIn a statement earlier Wednesday, Fairfax maintained that his interaction with Tyson was consensual. \"At no time did she express to me any discomfort or concern about our interactions, neither during that encounter nor the months following it, when she stayed in touch with me, nor the past fifteen years,\" Fairfax said in the statement. \"She in no way indicated that anything that had happened between us made her uncomfortable.\"\n\nThe governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTyson contradicted Fairfax's denial, saying, \"I can not believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual. To be very clear, I did not want to engage in oral sex with Mr. Fairfax and I never gave any form of consent.\"\n\n\"I suffered from both deep humiliation and shame,\" Tyson said, adding that she did not tell anyone for years.\n\nShe did approach The Washington Post with her story last year, but the paper said it did not publish her story because it could not find anyone to corroborate it.\n\nTyson is a professor of politics at Scripps College in California, although she is on fellowship at Stanford University this year. In addition to being a professor and author, Tyson advocates for sexual assault awareness and prevention, according to the Scripps College website.\n\nShe said in her statement that the allegations are not politically motivated and that she is a \"proud Democrat.\"\n\nTyson is represented by Katz, Marshall & Banks, the same law firm that represented Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of assault last year. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe allegation against Fairfax surfaced after a photo was released Friday of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's (D) medical school yearbook page that pictured a man dressed in blackface and another dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D) on Wednesday also admitted to using blackface as a teenager, deepening the leadership crisis in the Commonwealth.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Alters Political Landscape, Exposes GOP Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of political developments, Donald Trump, a presidential candidate and business magnate, has been vocal about his criticisms of the Republican Party, alleging that it is led by delusional and incompetent politicians who have failed to deliver significant victories. Trump's comments come amidst a backdrop of a 15-year-long war, during which the GOP has spent two trillion dollars and lost thousands of American lives without achieving any tangible results.\n\nFor years, numerous politicians have promised to reform Washington, D.C., but have failed to deliver on their promises. According to Trump, the Obama administration has manipulated the weak House of Representatives and Senate, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among Americans.\n\nTrump's candidacy has gained momentum, with Senator Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio struggling to gain traction in the race. This dynamic has allowed Trump to maintain a strong position in the Republican primary race. The current state of the Republican Party, according to Trump, is a reflection of the self-serving nature of politicians who prioritize their personal status over the common good of the country.\n\nIn the past nine months, Trump has reportedly dismantled the Jeb Bush campaign and has been successful in making a mockery of the two first-term senators. Trump's campaign strategy has put him on a clear path to winning the Republican nomination.\n\nTrump's unconventional approach to politics has resonated with a significant portion of the American electorate, particularly those who have been yearning for a'shake-up' in the political landscape. Trump's campaign has been successful in various regions across the country, catapulting him to the forefront of the race.\n\nWhile Trump is not without flaws, his candidacy has exposed the Republican Party for what many perceive as its true nature. Some Americans view Trump as a real, action-oriented candidate who is unafraid to challenge the status quo, causing politicians to quiver in their shallow shoes. The future of the Republican Party and the 2016 presidential race remains uncertain, but Trump's impact on the political landscape is undeniable.",
    " Title: House Democrats Begin Process to Obtain President Trump's Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats will initiate the first step toward obtaining President Donald Trump's personal tax returns, with a hearing scheduled for Thursday by the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. The hearing aims to discuss legislative proposals and laws governing the process to acquire the documents.\n\nThe hearing will feature testimony from a group of tax law experts, including a 1924 measure that allows the chairman of the tax-writing panel to privately examine anyone's tax returns. A majority vote from the committee would be required to publicly release the returns, if obtained.\n\nDemocratic leaders argue that the filings could provide insight into Trump's global businesses, wealth, debt, charitable giving, and potential conflicts of interest. The call for Trump to make his tax returns public dates back to the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign, but he never released them.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., has suggested a cautious approach, preferring to hold a hearing before acting to obtain the documents. Hoyer stated, \"A president of the United States is in a very unique position to individually do things, as this president has displayed probably more than most. And, therefore, it's important that the American people know whether the president is acting on their behalf or in his interest.\"\n\nRepublican opposition to the release of Trump's tax returns is not necessarily about Trump's returns but rather about \"protecting the rights of every private taxpayer,\" according to Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the committee who chose not to pursue Trump's returns during the last Congress.\n\nFive witnesses are expected to testify at the hearing, including Joseph J. Thorndike, George K. Yin, Noah Bookbinder, Steven M. Rosenthal, and Ken Kies. The hearing will provide insight into the legal and political implications of obtaining President Trump's tax returns.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Arizona's Immigration Law's \"Show Me Your Papers\" Provision, Strikes Down Criminal Penalties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States on Monday issued a 5-3 ruling that struck down most of Arizona's controversial immigration law, SB 1070, as an unlawful infringement on federal power. However, the court upheld the provision that allows police to stop and question individuals they suspect are in the country illegally, often referred to as the \"Show Me Your Papers\" provision.\n\nArizona Governor Jan Brewer, a Republican, announced plans to move forward with enforcing the upheld part of the law, despite the rest of it being struck down. The ruling comes less than a week after President Obama announced a policy change to stop deporting most young adult illegal immigrants.\n\nIn the complex ruling, all eight justices agreed that Arizona police can question the legal status of those they stop, but the five-justice majority struck down the parts of the law that sought to impose Arizona's own criminal penalties for immigration violations. The majority argued that this power is reserved exclusively for the federal government.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, stated that states cannot act in areas in which the Constitution grants powers to Congress, specifically citing Article I, Section 8, Clause 4, which grants Congress powers over naturalization.\n\nJustices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. each wrote dissents, arguing that Arizona should have been allowed to enact its own penalties for immigration violations, as long as they do not conflict with federal law.\n\nThe law, signed by Governor Brewer in 2010, required police to check the immigration status of those they encountered whom they had reasonable suspicion were in the country illegally, and required them to contact federal immigration authorities to give them a chance to put the individuals in deportation proceedings. The law also imposed state penalties on illegal immigrants who applied for jobs.\n\nThe Obama administration sued to stop the law, and lower courts stayed both of those parts of the law. Governor Brewer appealed, and the case went to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the intervening two years, a handful of other states moved ahead with their own crackdown laws, while other localities codified so-called sanctuary-city policies that discouraged police from reporting illegal immigrants to federal authorities. The Obama administration has not taken action against the sanctuary city policies.\n\nDuring the debate over SB 1070, President Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. both criticized the law as opening up the chance for racial profiling. However, when they sued, they did not make that argument, instead confining their challenge to issues of federal versus state power.\n\nThe racial profiling challenge could still come later, as the law begins to be enforced. Governor Brewer expects this and has issued an executive order asking that training materials be distributed to all police to refresh them on what constitutes reasonable suspicion for a stop. Race or ethnicity alone is not enough to meet the threshold.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Thursday's ruling opens the floodgates for other states to follow suit. In 2011, the court upheld an earlier Arizona law that required all businesses in the state to use E-Verify, the voluntary electronic system the federal government makes available for businesses to ensure their new hires are legal workers. After Arizona, a series of other states passed similar E-Verify laws, but that pace slackened in 2012, according to a study by ImmigrationWorks USA, which pushes for a broad national legalization solution to illegal immigration.",
    " Title: George Zimmerman Verdict and the Persistence of Racial Bias in American Society\n\nArticle:\n\nThe verdict in the George Zimmerman trial, which resulted in his acquittal, has sparked widespread debate and controversy. The case, which revolved around the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a young African-American, by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, has been met with mixed reactions.\n\nThe case, according to some analysts, is a reflection of a more subtle form of racial bias in American society, often referred to as \"laissez-faire racism.\" This form of racism, as explained by Harvard sociologist Lawrence Bobo, is based on the notion that African Americans themselves and their cultural norms are to blame for their social and economic position in American life.\n\nThis perspective is encapsulated in the quote by Chief Justice John Roberts: \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" The shift from overt racism to a more subtle form, as described by Roberts, has led to a situation where overt racism is no longer enshrined in law, but the application and effects of that racism are still being felt.\n\nThe case of Jordan Davis, another shooting incident in Florida, is often cited as a parallel to the Trayvon Martin case. These incidents are not about the law, although Stand Your Ground may embolden those who might have otherwise retreated, but a culture that treats all black youth as potential suspects, as potential drug dealers or gang members, or almost definitely a gun owner, despite doing little more than listening to music loudly.\n\nIt's important to note that African-Americans do not commit crimes at higher rates than whites. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Justice Statistics, rates of robbery and serious property offenses among black youth are at their lowest in 40 years. Rates of violent crime and victimization also show a similar trend.\n\nHowever, young black men are a disproportionate share of the nation's murder victims. This disproportionate representation is often linked to factors such as hyper-segregation, entrenched poverty, and lack of economic opportunities in many black communities.\n\nThe prevalence of violence in these communities has led to the emergence of numerous inner-city anti-violence groups that focus on creating opportunities for young, disadvantaged African-Americans through education, mentoring, and community programs.\n\nCritics argue that the U.S. has not reached a post-racial society, and that laws are not free of racism. The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his analysis of the Trayvon Martin case, states that the injustice in the case was not due to a weak prosecution, but rather a result of a country that has, for the majority of its history, erected a pariah class.\n\nIn conclusion, the George Zimmerman trial and the subsequent verdict serve as a stark reminder of the persistence of racial bias in American society. The case is not about the law, but a reflection of a culture and system that is not designed for equality. The first step towards addressing this issue, as acknowledged by many, is acknowledging and understanding the extent of this problem.",
    " Title: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Upholds Injunction Against Revised Travel Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a lower court ruling that blocks parts of President Trump's revised travel ban, marking the second time the court has ruled against the administration on the matter. The California-based court affirmed the Hawaii District Court ruling, which temporarily bars nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., suspends the entry of all refugees, and reduces the cap on the admission of refugees from 110,000 to 50,000 for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, a three-judge panel on the court said President Trump's revised order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality. The judges noted that the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the president broad powers to control the entry of foreigners, but stated that the president's authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints.\n\nThe judges cited President Trump's tweets in defending their finding that the order does not provide a reason why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. They also vacated the part of the lower court ruling that blocked the government's ability to conduct interagency reviews of its vetting procedures, but ordered the court to issue a new order that blocks the temporary ban while allowing the government to proceed with its review.\n\nThe court also called the government's argument that the District Court erred in issuing an injunction that runs against the president himself \"well taken.\" They vacated that part of the District Court's injunction to the extent the order runs against the president, but said it still applies to the remaining defendants and all their respective officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and people in active concert or participation with them.\n\nThe decision marks the second time the 9th Circuit has ruled against President Trump. In February, the court refused to reinstate Trump's first travel ban after a federal District Court judge in Washington state blocked it. President Trump revised the order to address the court's concerns, removing Iraq from the list of banned countries, eliminating the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees, and deleting language that gave preference to religious minorities when the refugee program resumed.\n\nThe administration has already asked the Supreme Court to step in. The Department of Justice filed two emergency applications on June 1 asking the Supreme Court to block the 4th Circuit and Hawaii District Court rulings blocking the ban and to review its case. The Supreme Court had asked the groups fighting the ban to respond to the department's requests by 3 p.m. on Monday. The 9th Circuit is now the second federal appeals court to rule against President Trump's revised travel ban. A full panel of 13 judges on the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to reinstate it, but focused on the statements Trump made while on the campaign trail and in office in finding the order discriminatory. The judges said in their 10-3 ruling that the revised order \"speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\"",
    " Title: The Democratic Party's Decline During the Obama Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently facing a political crisis, with the potential for the situation to worsen if they do not win the White House in November. One aspect of President Obama's legacy is the weakening of his party. While Obama achieved numerous successes during his tenure, such as health care reform, climate change regulations, and Wall Street reform, his legacy will also include a significant failure: a diminished Democratic Party.\n\nDuring Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative, and governor seats than under any other president. When Obama took office, there were 60 Democratic senators; now there are 46. The number of House seats held by Democrats has shrunk from 257 to 188. There are now nine fewer Democratic governors than in 2009. Democrats currently hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the 1920s.\n\nThe electoral landscape in the United States can be divided into two distinct categories: Presidential Election America and Midterm Election America. Presidential Elections attract a diverse electorate that is younger, browner, more single, more secular \u2013 more Democratic. In contrast, Midterm Elections attract an older, whiter, more rural, more church-going \u2013 in other words, more Republican \u2013 electorate. The majority of governorships and state legislative seats are elected during Midterm Elections, and the Democrats are currently at a low ebb in these positions.\n\nPresident Obama himself has acknowledged this issue, lamenting the Democrats' inability to mobilize voters during Midterm Elections. He suggested that Democrats may not view Midterms as \"sexy enough.\" The Democrats also faced a significant setback due to the Republicans' Tea Party-fueled surge in 2010, which coincided with the decennial census and allowed the Republicans to draw new congressional and state legislative district boundaries, disadvantaging the Democrats.\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell noted the impact of this redistricting in his state, stating, \"When I left office in January of 2011, there were 13 Democratic congressmen and six Republican congressmen. As a result of redistricting in the 2010 election, that turned around, and we now have 13 Republican congressmen and five Democratic congressmen.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party's decline is not solely due to bad timing and gerrymandering. Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic National Committee official, notes that the Democrats have historically neglected state legislative races, while the Republicans prioritize these races. This disparity makes it easier for the Republicans to draw congressional and state legislative districts that disadvantage Democrats.\n\nDemocratic voters are often clustered in urban areas, which, for the purposes of winning elections, means that Democratic voters are not efficiently distributed. This is why, despite being in red states like Texas and Utah, there are cities that are solidly Democratic, and why lesbian mayors were elected in Houston and Salt Lake City. When Democrats cluster in and around cities, they win local elections, but this does not help them win suburban or rural congressional seats.\n\nThis November, the stakes for the Democrats could not be higher. Without the White House, assuming party control elsewhere remains the same, the Democrats would be truly out in the cold.",
    " Title: ICE Council President Criticizes Gang of 8 for Excluding Law Enforcement Input in Immigration Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent hearing on the new Gang of 8 illegal immigration overhaul, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council President Chris Crane expressed frustration with the lack of law enforcement input in the development of the new legislation. Crane stated, \"Never before have I seen such contempt for law enforcement officers as what I've seen from the Gang of 8.\"\n\nCrane claimed that law enforcement agents, including border sheriffs, interior sheriffs, deputies, and immigration agents, came to Washington D.C. with the hope of having their concerns heard. However, according to Crane, not one member of the Gang of 8 attended the two meetings held on separate days. Furthermore, Crane was escorted out by police during a recent Gang of 8 press conference after asking a question.\n\nCrane has previously stated that the Gang of 8 plan does not address the criminal alien and cartel element in the United States, and falls short in allowing ICE agents to enforce current immigration laws both on the border and on the interior of the country. In a phone call with reporters two weeks ago, Crane said, \"We are not even scratching the surface on the criminal illegal alien problem in the United States.\" He also noted that the drug cartels, their lieutenants, and troops are operating within the interior of the United States, and that many other criminal elements and individuals are also present.\n\nCrane expressed concern that the debate on immigration reform is primarily political and not focused on addressing the problems within the broken immigration system and ensuring public safety. He stated, \"That conversation is almost completely absent from this entire public conversation about what's happening... It's just another part of this debate that gives us this concern that this is all about politics and not about really fixing the problems that we face within our broken immigration system and providing for what is best for everyone, including and most importantly, public safety.\"\n\nThe Gang of 8, a bipartisan group of senators, is responsible for drafting the immigration overhaul bill. The bill aims to address issues such as border security, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and the modernization of the legal immigration system. The bill has been met with both support and criticism from various groups, including law enforcement, business, and immigrant rights organizations. The hearings on the bill are ongoing.",
    " Title: GOP Criticism Mounts as Trump Continues Attacks on Khans, Parents of Army Captain Killed in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a controversial week that saw Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's wife, Melania, accused of plagiarizing passages from Michelle Obama's convention speech, Trump continued his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq.\n\nKhizr Khan delivered a powerful speech criticizing Trump at last week's Democratic National Convention. Trump's sustained hostility towards the Khans has made other Republican candidates and officeholders deeply uncomfortable. On Monday morning, Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom Trump once mocked for being shot down and captured during the Vietnam War, issued a nearly 700-word statement denouncing Trump's critiques of the Khans.\n\n\"In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier's parents. He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States \u2014 to say nothing of entering its service,\" McCain said. \"I can not emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump's statement.\"\n\nMcCain continued, \"I claim no moral superiority over Donald Trump. I have a long and well-known public and private record for which I will have to answer at the Final Judgment, and I repose my hope in the promise of mercy and the moderation of age. I challenge the nominee to set the example for what our country can and should represent.\"\n\n\"Arizona is watching. It is time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future of the Republican Party. While our Party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,\" McCain added.\n\nLastly, McCain said, \"I'd like to say to Mr. and Mrs. Khan: thank you for immigrating to America. We're a better country because of you. And you are certainly right; your son was the best of America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation \u2014 and he will never be forgotten.\"\n\nOn the final night of the Democratic convention, Khizr Khan spoke out against Trump's call to temporarily ban all Muslim immigrants from the United States, asking whether the candidate had read the Constitution before pulling out a copy from his suit jacket and offering to lend Trump his personal copy.\n\nTrump, in turn, criticized the Khans in TV appearances and on Twitter. Speaking to ABC's This Week, he asked whether Ghazala Khan \"was not allowed to have anything to say.\" (Her response: speaking about her dead son is too painful for her to do in public.)\n\nRepublicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spent the weekend issuing statements distancing themselves from Trump's attacks on the Muslim immigrants. However, Trump continued to tweet on Monday morning.\n\nDespite a Sunday night statement issued by Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, that sought to paint a more conciliatory picture, saying, \"Donald Trump and I believe that Captain Humayun Khan is an American hero and his family, like all Gold Star families, should be cherished by every American,\" Trump continued to tweet.\n\nGold Star families is a term the military uses for the parents, siblings, and children of men and women killed in combat.\n\nIn a Monday morning appearance on the Today Show, Khizr Khan said of Trump's response, \"this candidate amazes me \u2014 his ignorance. He can get up and malign the entire nation. The religions, the communities, the minorities, the judges.\"\n\nKhan continued, \"And yet a private citizen in this political process, in his candidacy for the stewardship of this country, I can not say what I feel? That proves the point he has not read the Constitution of the country.\"\n\nDespite being dragged into a feud with the GOP's presidential nominee, Khan said his last week was a positive experience. \"My belief in the goodness of America is reaffirmed,\" he said. \"Everywhere people are supporting our message. People are hugging, holding hands, wanting to get pictures. That is the goodness of America I was speaking about.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes to Alter Long-standing Flores Settlement on Immigrant Child Detention\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced a proposal to alter a decades-old legal settlement, known as the Flores agreement, which currently prevents the long-term detention of immigrant children when families are arrested for attempting to enter the United States illegally. The proposal, announced as a rule change in the Federal Register, aims to allow families to be detained together until their immigration cases are decided.\n\nThe proposal, if implemented, would circumvent the 1997 Flores agreement, which restricts authorities from detaining children for more than 20 days. The administration earlier this year was denied by a federal judge in California when it asked to detain families beyond the 20-day limit.\n\nThe new proposal would allow families, most of whom are seeking asylum, to be detained together throughout the duration of their lengthy immigration proceedings. The proposal states that it would offer protections similar to those outlined in the Flores settlement.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated in a statement that the rule addresses the department's inability to enforce immigration laws due to legal loopholes. The rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, and the public will have 60 days to comment.\n\nThe zero-tolerance policy, implemented earlier this year, resulted in the separations of children from their families who were arrested at the border. President Trump, facing a widespread outcry, then ordered an end to the separations. The government has reunited nearly 2,000 once-separated children but is still trying to reconnect almost 500 children whose parents have been deported.\n\nUnder the Flores agreement, immigrant children must be held in licensed child-care facilities. The government has been unable to obtain such licenses for the two largest family detention centers in Texas and has bed space for more than 3,000 people. A smaller facility in Pennsylvania is licensed to care for children but has room for only about 100 people.\n\nThe administration wants to now \"create an alternative to the existing licensed program requirement for family residential centers, so that ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] may use appropriate facilities to detain family units together during their immigration proceedings, consistent with applicable law.\"\n\nThe proposal has faced swift condemnation from immigration advocates and others. Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, stated, \"It is sickening to see the United States government looking for ways to jail more children for longer. That's the complete opposite of what we should be doing.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated, \"My position's been really clear about this: We should not be separating people at the border.\" He added, \"I believe that's what the administration also agrees...we shouldn't be separating families at the border.\"\n\nIn addition, the administration announced on Thursday that ICE deported more than 191,000 immigrants between October and the end of June, a 9% increase from the same time last year. During the Trump administration's first year, 226,199 immigrants were deported, a nearly 6% decrease from the last year of the Obama administration. The agency has also made nearly 120,000 arrests, a 16% increase since last year. About 55% of those arrested were convicted criminals, according to Nathalie Asher, the ICE official running the agency's enforcement and removal operations. She stated that the majority of noncriminal immigrants arrested \"came to ICE's attention due to criminal charges.\"",
    " Title: Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein Defends Justice Department's Handling of Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in his first interview since the conclusion of the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, defended the Justice Department's handling of the still-secret report, stating that Attorney General William Barr is \"being as forthcoming as he can\" in the process of redacting and releasing the roughly 400-page document.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Rosenstein countered suggestions that Mr. Barr is misleading the public by releasing only a four-page summary of Mueller's investigation. The attorney general, in his letter, stated that the Mueller probe found no evidence of President Trump and his campaign conspiring with Russian interference in the 2016 election but reached no conclusion about whether the president obstructed justice. With no recommendation, Mr. Barr and Mr. Rosenstein determined Mr. Trump's actions were not criminal.\n\nDemocrats have demanded access to the full report, which Mr. Barr said he would release, likely next week, after blacking out portions for sensitive information. Mr. Rosenstein dismissed concerns that Mr. Barr is seeking to protect the president from politically damaging information the report may contain.\n\n\"He's being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he's trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre,\" Mr. Rosenstein said.\n\nMr. Barr is under pressure to quickly produce the edited report amid concerns from Democrats that the attorney general, a longtime advocate of executive-branch authority, is withholding information. Their worries were heightened after reports that some investigators on Mr. Mueller's team had told associates in recent days that they believe the report is more critical of Mr. Trump on the obstruction issue than Mr. Barr indicated in his summary. Mr. Rosenstein declined to discuss why Mr. Mueller rendered no conclusion on that critical question.\n\n\"It would be one thing if you put out a letter and said, 'I'm not going to give you the report,'\" Mr. Rosenstein said. \"What he said is, 'Look, it's going to take a while to process the report. In the meantime, people really want to know what's in it. I'm going to give you the top-line conclusions.'\"\n\nMr. Rosenstein, Mr. Barr, their top advisers, and a member of Mr. Mueller's team have been involved in reviewing the report for material related to intelligence sources, continuing investigations, grand-jury matters, and the privacy of individuals not charged with crimes. Mr. Rosenstein declined to discuss the progress of this process, only expressing confidence in Mr. Barr.\n\nThe interview took place in Mr. Rosenstein's fourth-floor office at the Justice Department, in his waning days on the job. With the special counsel investigation he oversaw now complete, Mr. Trump's nominee to replace him, Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen, awaits Senate confirmation. After nearly 30 years in the department, Mr. Rosenstein, 54, said he doesn't know what he will do next, only that he hopes to start a new job at the end of the summer.\n\nOn the day before the interview, Mr. Barr announced he would form a team to examine the origins of a 2016 counterintelligence investigation that conducted what he termed as \"spying\" on people associated with the Trump campaign. This characterization has been found disturbing by Democrats and some former Justice Department officials, including fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in San Francisco on Thursday, Mr. Comey said, \"When I hear that kind of language used, it's concerning, because the FBI and Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance. I have never thought of that as spying.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Barr's review will examine any of Mr. Rosenstein's actions, such as his approval of an application to ask a court to grant continued surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who had long been on the radar of U.S. counterintelligence for his communications with Russians. Mr. Rosenstein declined to comment on Mr. Barr's inquiry of that counterintelligence probe, but he said generally that he is open to objective scrutiny and stands by his approval of the renewal.\n\nMr. Rosenstein has been under an unusually intense spotlight as the No. 2 Justice Department official, largely because of his decision to appoint Mr. Mueller early in his tenure, which drew repeated swipes from Mr. Trump and concerns among some of the president's advisers that he would move to fire the deputy attorney general. Mr. Rosenstein said he has stayed on the job at Mr. Barr's request, adding, \"for me, it's a real privilege.\"\n\nEarly on, at Mr. Trump's request, Mr. Rosenstein wrote a memo that the White House initially cited as grounds for firing Mr. Comey. On Thursday, he said he stands by the memo and has few regrets about his time in office.\n\n\"If you put something in writing, put your name on it and be prepared to stand behind it,\" he said. \"That's been a theme of my career.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Threatens to Use Military Force, Withhold Aid Over Migrant Caravan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, President Donald Trump announced his intention to take various measures to stop a caravan of thousands of migrants traveling from Central America towards the United States' southern border. The president accused Democrats of being responsible for the \"assault on our country\" by illegal immigration, and threatened to withhold aid from the countries involved if they do not take action to stop the flow of people entering Mexico and the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote, \"I am watching the Democrat Party led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U.S.\" He also stated, \"In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\"\n\nFurthermore, Trump stated that the issue of the migrant caravan is more important to him than trade or the USMCA, and expressed hope that Mexico would stop the onslaught at their northern border. He also blamed Democrats for weak laws.\n\nThe president's tweets come in response to a caravan of over 4,000 people traveling from Honduras towards the U.S. southern border. Earlier this week, Trump also threatened to withhold aid from Honduras if the country failed to stop the caravan. The specific details of the aid and the extent to which the caravan will be stopped are not yet clear.",
    " Title: New York Times Publishes Controversial Op-Ed by Sen. Tom Cotton, Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Tom Cotton (R-AR) has responded to the backlash following the publication of his op-ed in The New York Times, which urged President Trump to send in the military to quell the violent riots that have erupted in the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. In a tweet, Cotton commended the newspaper for standing up to the \"woke progressive mob\" in their own newsroom.\n\nIn his piece, Cotton argued for a more aggressive response to the ongoing protests, stating that the police have \"responded with more violence\" against protesters, journalists, and bystanders. The New York Times editorial board has forcefully defended the protests as patriotic and criticized the use of force.\n\nThe publication of Cotton's op-ed sparked controversy, with many critics arguing that the Times should not have given a platform to a lawmaker who advocated for a more aggressive response to the protests. In response, the Times editorial page editor, James Bennet, issued a statement explaining why they published the piece.\n\n\"I want to explain why we published the piece today by Senator Tom Cotton,\" Bennet wrote on Twitter. \"The Times editorial board has forcefully defended the protests as patriotic and criticized the use of force. We \u2019ve also crusaded for years against the underlying, systemic cruelties that led to these protests. Times Opinion owes it to our readers to show them counter-arguments, particularly those made by people in a position to set policy.\"\n\nBennet's message was accompanied by opinion pieces the editorial board has written to prove that they've always been on the side of social justice. The reaction by NYT reporters and many of the paper's readers to Cotton's op-ed has been criticized as a \"liberal college campus\" mentality, with some arguing that the Times should not be shutting down or protesting opinions they don't want to hear.\n\nIt is unclear whether the controversy surrounding Cotton's op-ed will affect the publication of future op-eds from other conservative lawmakers. However, it is worth noting that the Times has a history of publishing a wide range of viewpoints, and the publication of Cotton's op-ed is consistent with that tradition.",
    " Title: Obama Kicks Off Economic Campaign, Outlining Vision for Economic Growth and Job Security\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will commence a multi-week campaign on Wednesday to advocate for economic growth and encourage resistant Republicans to collaborate on bolstering the economy. The campaign will involve a series of speeches, beginning with a major address at Knox College in western Illinois.\n\nIn these speeches, Obama will outline his vision for how Washington and the private sector can stimulate an economy that is improving, but only in fits and starts. This latest push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on the economy, an issue that Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to the president, believes has been neglected by Congress.\n\nTopics related to the economy that Obama will address in the coming weeks include job security, education, and healthcare. Pfeiffer stated that instead of discussing ways to help the middle class, too many in Congress are focused on scoring political points, revisiting past battles, and fabricating scandals.\n\nIn response, Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, stated, \"We welcome the president's focus on the economy, but given that so many are still struggling after nearly five years, it's clear his agenda of higher taxes and higher spending is not the answer.\"\n\nObama chose the small town of Galesburg, Illinois, where he has a long history, to start the push. He was first endorsed by former representative Lane Evans in 2003 when Obama was a state senator and underdog candidate for the U.S. Senate. Since then, Galesburg has remained a personal touchstone for Obama.\n\nIn 2004, Obama pointed to Galesburg in his Democratic National Convention keynote address, highlighting the community's struggles after the Maytag plant closed and moved jobs to Mexico. He delivered the commencement address at Knox College in 2005, his first major economic address, and, according to Pfeiffer, \"sowed the seeds\" of Obama's economic vision.\n\nIn addition to his return to Galesburg, Obama will travel to rural Warrensburg, Missouri, on Wednesday and Jacksonville on Thursday to deliver remarks. It remains unclear to what extent he will emphasize his desire to see Congress pass immigration laws in his speeches, as the Senate has passed immigration legislation, but the GOP-controlled House has shown reluctance.\n\nThe president has resisted wading too deeply into the immigration debate on Capitol Hill, a strategy aimed at creating a \"permission structure\" that would allow the most conservative lawmakers to support the law without appearing supportive of the president. However, as hopes for the legislation fade, Obama may be cautiously stepping deeper into that debate.",
    " Title: Online Learning Platforms See Surge in Enrollments Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, many individuals are utilizing their self-isolation period to enhance their skillset through online learning platforms such as edX, FutureLearn, and Coursera, which offer Massive Open Online Courses (Moocs). Coursera, for instance, has experienced an eightfold increase in enrollments for social science, personal development, arts, and humanities courses since the onset of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDevoting time to self-education during this economic uncertainty makes sense, as learning a new skill can provide a sense of control that aids in coping with the anxiety generated by the epidemic. James Wallman, author of \"Time and How to Spend It,\" states that personal growth is central to many psychological theories of long-term happiness. Although an hour spent listening to a lecture may not be as appealing as the instant gratification offered by reality TV or social media, it will lead to greater life-satisfaction in the long term.\n\nThe specifics of the courses vary from platform to platform, though many follow a similar structure. With larger platforms such as edX, Coursera, and FutureLearn, you can choose university-affiliated courses, ensuring that you are learning from experts in the field. The courses range in length, from a few hours to a regular, weekly commitment over several months, and typically involve video lectures, reading texts, and regular tests to assess memory and understanding of the syllabus.\n\nEnrollment is often free, but a fee may be required to obtain a certificate verifying course completion. While you may be tempted to sign up for courses with the most prestigious instructors, James Murphy, who used Moocs to prepare a master's degree while housebound with an illness, advises against this. Many platforms offer user reviews, allowing you to gauge other learners' enjoyment and satisfaction with the course. However, Murphy suggests that the best advice is to sign up and see if you like it \u2013 there's no reason to stick with a course you dislike if the delivery isn't engaging.\n\nIf you are considering the cost of the certificate for professional development, you may want to check whether employers recognize the qualification. Coursera's Shravan Goli points out that about 30 companies now accept the Google-affiliated course on IT management, for example. The reviews can guide you on this, as can the course descriptions, which sometimes include statistics from student surveys about the professional benefits that came from the experience.\n\nIt's also important to choose a course of the right difficulty \u2013 something just beyond your comfort-zone \u2013 engaging enough to occupy your mind, but not so ambitious that it's frustrating. This way, you'll achieve the \"flow state.\" \"You'll lose track of time,\" says Wallman \u2013 and the deep concentration will feel much more rewarding than simply scrolling through social media.\n\nEven if you have chosen a course that is perfectly suited to your goals, you may find your initial enthusiasm evaporates, and your discipline trails off. \"Lack of routine and time is often the biggest hurdle,\" says writer and regular Mooc user Bianca Barratt. Her advice is to try to set up a schedule and \"treat it like a physical class you've signed up for. Show up when you say you will, make an effort with the class exercises and homework, and complete the course in full.\"\n\nAnother good strategy, according to Anant Agarwal, the founder and CEO of edX, is to find a \"study buddy or form a bigger learning group, so that they can motivate each other and enjoy the course together.\" You might make a pact with people you already know, or you could connect with people from the discussion forums that accompany the course. Like your classmates at a traditional school or university, you can help each other to understand the difficult material, and the feeling of accountability might spur you on when you find distractions drawing you away from your goal.\n\nFor some, this may be just the start of the journey \u2013 furnishing them with a greater confidence to learn and the motivation to take it further. If you find that you're hooked, many of the platforms also provide accredited bachelor's and master's degrees from selected universities, though this will be more expensive.\n\nFor others, the completion of a single course will be enough. But whatever your goals, the quest to learn a new skill or discipline may be the perfect distraction from the frustrations of self-isolation \u2013 allowing you to connect with new people and transforming this period into a time of enlightenment and self-discovery.\n\nHere are seven Moocs to expand your mind:\n\n1. \"Learning How to Learn\" \u2013 With over 2 million enrollments, this short course offers the mental tools for mastering any new subject.\n2. \"The Elegant Universe\" \u2013 Physicist Hitoshi Murayama examines the origins of the universe.\n3. \"Effective Communication\" \u2013 Professor James Engell will help you to polish your communication skills in this eight-week course.\n4. \"Food: Transformation of the Senses\" \u2013 Physicists, chemists, and restaurant chefs explore the transformation of food in the kitchen.\n5. \"Writing for Television and Screen\" \u2013 If your mind is fizzing with inspiration for a Netflix mini-series, this course \u2013 from UEA's prestigious creative writing program \u2013 will help you translate it to the screen.\n6. \"Mathematical Logic\" \u2013 Not for the fainthearted, but more than 200,000 learners have taken this journey through the basics of mathematical logic and proof.\n7. \"The Ancient Wisdom/Modern Science\" \u2013 Bestselling author Robert Wright examines what modern psychology can learn from ancient teachings.",
    " Title: Baltimore Riots of 1968 and Their Lasting Impact Compared to Recent Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent rioting in Baltimore has sparked comparisons to the turmoil that swept the city in April 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The 1968 riots, which lasted almost four days, resulted in six deaths, 700 injuries, and the destruction of 1,000 businesses. In contrast, the current riots in Baltimore have not reached the same magnitude.\n\nThe 1968 riots had significant political implications, particularly for then-Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew, a moderate Republican who had carried a substantial portion of the black vote in the 1966 election. Agnew, who later became Richard Nixon's vice-presidential running mate, criticized black leaders for their silence in the face of widespread violence. His confrontational approach was a significant factor in Nixon's choice of Agnew as his running mate.\n\nThe riots also had a profound impact on Baltimore Mayor Tommy D'Alessandro, the brother of current House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. D'Alessandro's political career ended due to the riots, as he had planned to run for governor in 1970 but was replaced by the Democratic leader of the state senate, Marvin Mandel.\n\nThe 2008 documentary \"Baltimore '68\" by radio station WYPR notes that black leaders were conflicted about the looting and burning during the riots, sympathizing with the anger and despair but recognizing the damage to the black community. The documentary also suggests that the riots may have contributed to the law-and-order backlash of the 1970s and 1980s, leading to a national criminal justice policy that resulted in thousands of black men being incarcerated. Some scholars argue that the large investments in welfare and anti-poverty programs after the riots may have undermined minority family structures and contributed to increased violence and a drug culture.\n\nComparisons between the current riots and those of 1968 should be made with caution. However, there is criticism of Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's handling of the recent unrest, particularly her statement that she instructed the police to protect protesters' right to free speech while also giving space to those who wished to destroy.\n\nThe article does not provide information on the current state of the ongoing riots or their potential impact on future urban unrest. It is hoped that lessons can be learned from the response to the riots that will be employed in other tense cities.",
    " Title: Automatic Pentagon Spending Cuts Threaten U.S. National Security, but Public Support for Defense Cuts Remains High\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta has warned that the automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, set to hit the Pentagon and other government branches next week will damage U.S. national security. In a letter to Congress, he stated that these cuts would put the military on a path toward a \"hollow force.\" However, the warnings do not seem to be swaying lawmakers or the American public.\n\nThe sequestration does not officially take effect until March 1, but its effects are already being felt. As President Obama noted this week, the Navy has decided not to send one of its aircraft carriers on a scheduled deployment to the Persian Gulf.\n\n\"As our military leaders have made clear, changes like this\u2014not well-thought through, not phased in properly\u2014changes like this affect our ability to respond to threats in unstable parts of the world,\" Obama said. At one time, idling an aircraft carrier to save money would have been unthinkable.\n\nSome Republicans are alarmed. House Speaker John Boehner calls the military cuts \"devastating.\" However, Congressional expert Sarah Binder of the Brookings Institution says the GOP is no longer united when it comes to protecting the Pentagon.\n\n\"There's a defense wing of defense hawks, and they've been pretty vocal about the impact on the Defense Department and national security, generally,\" she said. \"And we know there's a hard-core group as well that's opposed to any and all revenue increases.\"\n\n\"Between the two of those, there's no agreed-upon path of what to do, and so it looks like they may prefer the sequester to any alternative\u2014certainly the alternatives the Democrats are offering up,\" Binder added.\n\nObama is trying to enlist the public's help. He did a series of local TV interviews Wednesday and is planning to visit a military community outside Washington, D.C., next week. White House spokesman Jay Carney says the idea is to ramp up pressure on lawmakers to suspend the automatic cuts.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, congressional Republicans are going to listen to the American people,\" Carney said.\n\nHowever, the American people are not necessarily convinced that cutting the Pentagon budget is a bad idea. Last year, the Stimson Center in Washington, along with the Center for Public Integrity and the Program for Public Consultation, asked people how they'd like to address the federal deficit: by raising taxes, reducing defense spending, or cutting other parts of the government.\n\nNearly two-thirds of respondents opted for defense cuts. Matt Leatherman of the Stimson Center says defense spending was an area that respondents seemed to feel especially comfortable with reductions.\n\n\"Defense spending was an area that respondents seemed to feel especially comfortable with reductions,\" he said. \"There were some partisan splits, but I would point out that both Republicans and Democrats were comfortable reducing the defense budget.\"\n\nOther polls by Gallup, Harris, and the Pew Research Center produced similar findings. The Stimson Center survey was unusual in that people taking the poll were given information about the workings of the Pentagon budget.\n\n\"The more that Americans learn about their defense budget, the more aware they become that not everything is equal,\" Leatherman says. \"When you have a chance to really grapple with the material on your own, you perhaps feel more comfortable in saying, 'I'm prepared to prioritize this issue and accept more risk over here.'\"\n\nLeatherman notes that this does not mean Americans are comfortable with the kind of indiscriminate cuts to defense spending set to take effect next week. However, it does suggest the Pentagon is far from a sacred cow.\n\nThat could be put to the test if lawmakers can't make a deal to avoid across-the-board cuts. Congressional scholar Binder notes that those cuts were agreed to in 2011 as a way to postpone the pain of political gridlock. Nineteen months later, the gridlock has not gone away.\n\n\"They set up the can, they kind of set it up to explode, and sure enough, this looks like one of the few times it's actually going to go off,\" she says.",
    " Title: Luxury Beliefs Among the Upper Class: A New Form of Social Distinction\n\nArticle:\n\nA former classmate from Yale has expressed the view that monogamy is outdated and not beneficial for society. The individual, who comes from an affluent family and works at a well-known technology company, personally intends to have a monogamous marriage but believes that marriage should not be a universal expectation.\n\nThis perspective, according to the source, is a reflection of a broader trend among the upper class, where luxury beliefs serve as a means to display social status. These beliefs, which are ideas and opinions that confer status on the rich at minimal cost, are increasingly prevalent in contemporary society.\n\nOne such luxury belief is the notion that all family structures are equal. However, evidence suggests that families with two married parents are the most beneficial for young children. Yet, affluent, educated individuals raised by two married parents are more likely to believe that monogamy is outdated, marriage is a sham, or that all families are the same.\n\nAnother luxury belief is the denigration of religion, which is more common among the upper class. This perspective can be harmful to poor communities, as places of worship often serve as essential social fabrics.\n\nAdditionally, the luxury belief that individual decisions don't matter much compared to random social forces, including luck, is more common among the upper class. This belief can be damaging, as it may discourage disadvantaged individuals from striving for success.\n\nThe concept of white privilege is another luxury belief that has taken some time for the source to understand, as they grew up around poor whites. This belief, which suggests that racial disparities stem from inherent advantages held by whites, can be harmful to marginalized communities.\n\nRob Henderson, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge and a former Air Force member, has written about these luxury beliefs. Henderson suggests that, like fashionable clothing, these beliefs will soon be outdated, and in the future, the upper class may defame even more values in their quest for top-dog status.",
    " Title: Tim Pawlenty Endorses Jeb Bush for 2016 Republican Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty expressed his belief that former Florida Governor Jeb Bush can secure the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Wednesday. Pawlenty, who ended his own 2012 presidential campaign in the summer of 2011, cited the party's previous standard bearers, John McCain and Mitt Romney, as examples of establishment candidates who won the nomination.\n\n\"See John McCain; see Mitt Romney,\" Pawlenty said. \"In McCain's case, a very compelling personal story and a gritty performance; in Mitt Romney's case, obviously a man of great talent but also someone with a tremendous amount of campaign resources and infrastructure.\"\n\nPawlenty added that Bush, if he runs, will face competition from other candidates but can still win the nomination. He also noted that the Republican Party has \"shifted\" and now has a more libertarian wing, represented by senators like Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nRegarding Bush's last name potentially being a problem, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 69% of people agree with former first lady Barbara Bush's statement that \"there are more than two or three families who should run for high office in America.\" Ten percent of those who agreed said it applied more to Bush, while 7% said it applied more to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Fifty percent of those who agreed said it applied equally to both.\n\nCompared to about a year ago, Americans view Bush less favorably, with 21% viewing him positively and 32% having a negative view. Eleven months ago, 26% had a positive view of him, and 23% had a negative view. The poll of 1,000 adults taken from April 23-27 has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",
    " Title: Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford Suggests Preparedness for Military Confrontation with North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nMarine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated during a July 22 interview at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado, that a military confrontation with North Korea, whose nuclear program he deemed an urgent threat, should not be ruled out.\n\nDunford emphasized the importance of maintaining economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear arms program. However, he dismissed the notion that a military option should be considered \"unimaginable.\" Instead, he described a military response as \"horrific\" and potentially resulting in a loss of life unprecedented since World War II.\n\n\"Many people have talked about military options with words like 'unimaginable,'\" Dunford said. \"I would probably shift that slightly and say it would be horrific, and it would be a loss of life unlike any we have experienced in our lifetimes. But as I've told my counterparts, both friend and foe, it is not unimaginable to have military options to respond to North Korean nuclear capability.\"\n\nDunford's comments followed North Korea's testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile earlier this month. At present, Pyongyang is not believed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon on such missiles, but its rapid advancement in overall weapons systems is a significant concern for the Trump administration.\n\nDunford stated that the United States is already prepared to defend itself and allies such as South Korea and Japan against North Korea's current capability of carrying out a more limited missile attack.\n\nDunford assumed the role of Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman in October 2015, under then-President Barack Obama, and is the nation's highest-ranking military officer. Since President Donald Trump took office six months ago, Dunford has kept a relatively low profile, avoiding many of the internal battles that have characterized the Republican's tenure. However, he is involved in many of the key national security debates within the administration.\n\nAmong these debates is how to deal with Russia, which has taken adversarial positions against the United States in Syria and Ukraine and is suspected by U.S. intelligence agencies of interfering in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump himself has repeatedly cast doubt on whether Russia played a role in the election that he won. However, Dunford, like several other Trump administration officials who have appeared at the Aspen forum this week, said he had no reason to doubt the intelligence community's assessment.\n\nThroughout the discussion, which was moderated by Andrea Mitchell of NBC News, Dunford repeatedly expressed his support for the work of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is currently addressing a range of crises, including gathering more international support to pressure North Korea and attempting to repair a diplomatic rift between Qatar and a group of other countries led by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe State Department has been targeted for serious financial cuts under a Trump budget proposal that is facing stiff resistance in Congress. Dunford emphasized the importance of properly resourcing America's diplomats.\n\n\"I view the Department of Defense clearly in support of the State Department,\" Dunford said.\n\nThere were some light moments during the hour-long session. When asked how he gets along with Trump, Dunford said, \"He loves me! At least I think so.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Internal Emails About 2020 Census Citizenship Question Remain Partially Redacted\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census have been the subject of numerous lawsuits, with many internal emails and memos becoming public. These documents reveal that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, did not follow the initial claim that the Justice Department requested the question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. Instead, Ross is said to have pressured Commerce staff to add the question for reasons that a federal judge in Maryland has described as \"mysterious.\"\n\nPortions of the documents are redacted by the Trump administration, citing privileges such as attorney-client communications and certain decision-making discussions between government officials. The lawsuits' plaintiffs have attempted to have some of these protections lifted, but the courts have generally supported the administration.\n\nLawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have been seeking the full release of these emails, memos, and other unreleased documents as part of their investigation into the administration's motives for wanting the citizenship question. This week, President Trump invoked executive privilege over the requested documents, shortly before the committee's Democrats and Rep. Justin Amash, a Republican from Michigan, voted to hold Ross and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas for the documents.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the emails that could potentially spark another court battle over the citizenship question:\n\n- An email sent to Ross by Commerce Department official Earl Comstock on May 2, 2017\n- An email sent to Ross' then-chief of staff, Wendy Teramoto, by Ross on May 2, 2017\n- An email sent to Comstock by Ross on Aug. 8, 2017\n- An email sent to Comstock by Ross on Aug. 10, 2017 (The House oversight committee has asked the administration to release the memo that was attached to this unredacted email.)\n- An email sent to Comstock by Ross on Sept. 1, 2017\n- An email sent to Comstock by Ross on Sept. 1, 2017\n- An email sent to Commerce Department attorney James Uthmeier by Ross on Sept. 7, 2017\n- An email sent to White House official John Zadrozny by Uthmeier on Dec. 20, 2017\n- An email sent to Commerce Department attorney Michael Walsh by Uthmeier on Feb. 26, 2018\n\nThe House oversight committee has requested the administration to release the memo attached to the unredacted email sent to Comstock by Ross on Aug. 11, 2017.",
    " Title: Witness Testifies Bank CEO Sought Administration Role in Exchange for Manafort Loans\n\nArticle:\n\nA witness testified on Friday in the fraud trial of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort that the head of a small Chicago bank, Steve Calk, sought a role in the Trump administration in exchange for approving $16 million in loans to Manafort. Dennis Raico, a former executive at the bank, testified under immunity that Calk expressed interest in posts such as Treasury secretary or Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\nRaico stated that Calk took a personal interest in Manafort's loan applications and expedited them. One loan was approved a day after a July 27, 2016, call in which Calk expressed his desire for a role in the administration. Manafort later asked the incoming administration to consider tapping Calk for the secretary of the Army, according to testimony earlier in the week. Calk did not receive any post in the administration, although he was named to a Trump campaign advisory panel in August 2016.\n\nRaico was one of just three witnesses called to the stand on Friday as the trial resumed after an unexpected recess. The delay disrupted the prosecution's plans to wrap up its case by the end of the week. Greg Andres, a prosecutor on U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, said he would call James Brennan, a vice president at Federal Savings Bank who was also granted immunity, and two other witnesses on Monday before resting their case.\n\nIt was not clear if Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty to 18 felony counts of bank fraud, tax fraud, and failing to disclose about 30 foreign bank accounts, will call any witnesses. So far, Manafort's lawyers have focused their defense on attacking Rick Gates, Manafort's former right-hand man who cut a plea deal and is cooperating with Mueller's probe.\n\nRaico testified that Gates had nothing to do with the two Federal Savings loans in question - a $9.5 million mortgage on Manafort's estate in the Hamptons and a $6.5 million loan on a brownstone in Brooklyn. Prosecutors say Manafort lied about his income and provided other false information to get the loans.\n\nRaico said Calk asked him to call Manafort shortly after the Nov. 8, 2016, election, to see if he could be a candidate for the Treasury or HUD posts. Raico said the involvement of Calk in the Manafort loans was unusual and made him uncomfortable. He said he had never seen loans approved so quickly at the bank.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Richard Westling sought to show that the loans to Manafort were justified. Westling pointed out that the Hamptons property had been appraised at $13 million, well above the $9.5 million borrowed, and that the bank's credit committee had approved the loans.\n\nRaico said that a letter from Gates indicating that he, not Manafort, would be paying for Yankees season tickets in 2016 lowered his debts, helping him qualify for the Federal loans. In the letter, Gates said he had borrowed Manafort's American Express card to pay for the tickets, which cost more than $200,000 a year.\n\nIrfan Kirimca, senior director of ticket operations at the Yankees, testified on Friday that Manafort had purchased four season tickets since at least 2010 and that Gates never had an account with the Yankees. Kirimca said Manafort paid for the Legends Suite package, which includes food service and cushioned seats. Kirimca testified about one email exchange in which Manafort instructed a Yankees employee to send the tickets to his Trump Tower address.\n\nAndres also on Friday briefly questioned Andrew Chojnowski, chief operating officer of home lending at Federal, asking him whether Manafort had signed various documents warning that he could be prosecuted for giving false information to the bank. Chojnowski read one disclaimer which noted that mortgage fraud was punishable by up to 30 years in prison. Andres said he plans to call James Brennan, a Federal Savings executive who like Raico was granted immunity, on Monday. He then wants to recall Paula Liss, a special agent for the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, who testified earlier this week. Manafort's lawyers have opposed Liss taking the stand again, a matter on which T.S. Ellis, the judge overseeing the case, has yet to rule.\n\nEllis said the recess on Friday could not be avoided as he had matters to attend to. Without further details, courtroom observers were left to speculate about the reason for the break and a long bench discussion with attorneys from both sides. Ellis, who reminded jurors in the morning in unusual detail about the need to \"keep an open mind\" about the trial and not to talk to anyone about the case, gave them the same instructions before dismissing them for the weekend. \"Put it completely out of your mind until Monday,\" Ellis said.",
    " Title: Millions More American Workers to Become Eligible for Overtime Pay Under New Obama Administration Rule\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is finalizing a new rule on Wednesday that will make millions more American workers eligible for overtime pay. The rule states that anyone who makes less than $47,476 per year must receive time-and-a-half pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours a week. This is roughly double the current threshold of $23,660.\n\nThe measure is one of the most significant moves the Obama administration has made so far in its efforts to boost slow-growing incomes. However, it is expected to face opposition from some business owners. According to the Labor Department, the higher income threshold will make 4.2 million salaried workers newly eligible for overtime pay. The rule could also benefit millions of others who are already technically eligible but not receiving overtime.\n\nLabor Secretary Tom Perez told NPR, \"Our whole mission here is about strengthening and growing the middle class. In order to do that, we need to ensure that middle-class jobs pay middle-class wages.\"\n\nThe rule change is authorized under New Deal-era legislation called the Fair Labor Standards Act. As recently as 1975, more than 60 percent of salaried workers were eligible for overtime. Inflation and regulatory changes under the George W. Bush Administration eroded that protection, and today, only about 7 percent of salaried workers receive time-and-a-half when they work extra hours.\n\nCritics argue that the new rule will have a negative impact on businesses, particularly in low-wage industries. David French, vice president of the National Retail Federation, stated, \"They're going to make the rational change and they're going to change jobs.\"\n\nThe new rule has been more than two years in the making. The Labor Department initially proposed an even higher income threshold of more than $50,000 but scaled that back in response to complaints that it did not reflect pay scales in low-wage parts of the country. The new threshold will cover about 35 percent of salaried workers, Perez says.\n\nEmployers have a variety of ways they can comply with the new rule when it takes effect on December 1, according to Perez. \"People are going to get at least one of three benefits,\" Perez said. \"They're either going to get more money...more time with their family, or everybody is going to get clarity.\"",
    " Title: Trump Weighs In on Al Franken Allegations, Remains Silent on Roy Moore\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has remained largely silent on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore, has commented on the matter involving Democratic Sen. Al Franken. In a series of tweets on Thursday, Trump criticized Franken following a woman's allegation that he groped and kissed her without her consent.\n\nTrump's comments on Franken could potentially invite renewed scrutiny of the sexual assault allegations leveled against him. A source told CNN earlier this week that Trump's decision to not comment on the Moore controversy was partially due to this risk.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump referenced a photo of Franken in which he appears to grab a woman's breast while she was asleep during a 2006 USO tour. Franken has apologized for his behavior and has welcomed an ethics probe into his conduct.\n\nTrump continued his criticism, referencing a 1995 New York magazine article that quoted Franken joking about drugging and raping journalist Lesley Stahl in the \"Saturday Night Live\" writers' room. This issue arose during Franken's 2008 Senate election, for which he apologized at the time, though he later walked back the apology in his 2017 memoir.\n\nIn contrast, Trump has declined to weigh in forcefully on the Moore allegations, which surfaced as he was abroad in Asia. When the allegations first emerged, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement on behalf of the President, stating that Moore should drop out if the allegations of sexual misconduct are true. However, Trump has declined to comment further and has ignored several questions from reporters regarding whether Moore should drop out of the race.\n\nSanders stated on Thursday that Trump still believes Moore should step aside if the allegations are true, but the decision ultimately lies with the people of Alabama. Sanders also noted that a Senate investigation into the allegations against Franken was an \"appropriate action.\"\n\nTrump's relative silence on Moore is reportedly rooted in his own history of facing sexual misconduct allegations. A Republican close to the White House told CNN that Trump is apprehensive about being drawn into the topic of sexual assault or harassment if he weighs in.\n\nIn conversations within the West Wing on Wednesday, Trump expressed concern about the conversation shifting to his past accusers if he comments. \"He's worried about the conversation moving to his past accusers,\" the Republican familiar with the matter said, noting that the President believes his accusers were unfair, and some of Moore's may be as well.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway offered a different explanation for Trump's silence on Moore, telling Fox News on Friday that the Franken controversy was \"brand new\" when Trump returned from Asia, while the Moore story was \"eight days old.\"\n\nConway added, \"And since then, our press secretary has spoken on behalf of the president by saying that he believes the people of Alabama will sort out what to do with Roy Moore and with that election.\"\n\nHowever, Moore's controversy has remained a frequent news story since Trump returned, and two new Moore accusers came forward as recently as Wednesday.",
    " Title: Senate Begins Debate on Bipartisan Immigration Bill, Future Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate initiated a free-flowing debate on immigration legislation on Monday night, with the aim of finding a bipartisan compromise that can secure at least 60 votes, the minimum required to pass substantive matters. The objective is to provide legal protection for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, while also enhancing immigration enforcement.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) described the process as an opportunity for diverse ideas to be explored. McConnell has proposed a shell bill, open to amendments and debate over the coming days and weeks. The Senate voted 97-1 to commence the debate on Monday night, with only Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz voting against.\n\nIn September, President Trump announced the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shielded certain undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, from deportation. The president set a March 5 deadline for Congress to address the issue. Despite several proposals, including some bipartisan ones, there has been no vote on a bill in either chamber of Congress.\n\nOn Monday, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee unveiled a bill that would offer a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million DREAMers, in exchange for $25 billion for a border wall and at least a 25% reduction in legal immigration. The Secure and Succeed Act mirrors the White House's proposed acceptable solution.\n\nMcConnell endorsed the bill on the Senate floor on Monday, calling it a \"balanced proposal\" that offers a \"compassionate resolution\" for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\n\nThe bill's prospects in the Senate are uncertain, as most Democrats have expressed concerns over the significant reductions in legal immigration, and some conservatives have reservations about the path to citizenship for such a large group.\n\n\"Now is not the time, nor the place, to reform the entire legal immigration system. Rather, this is the moment for a narrow bill, and every ounce of our energy is going into finding one that can pass,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the floor Monday.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) described the legislation as \"a reasonable approach\" that is \"the only Senate proposal that has any chance of passing the House and being signed into law.\"\n\nUnlike the Senate, where the GOP has a 51-49 majority but needs 60 votes to pass legislation, Republicans in the House have a large enough majority that they do not require a single Democrat's support.\n\nBefore becoming speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan promised some of his party's most conservative members that he would not bring up immigration legislation that did not have the support of the majority of his party. Ryan has also stated he would not bring up legislation that does not have the support of the president, to avoid risking a veto.\n\n\"There's a lot at stake here. I take it personally because this has been a big part of my Senate career,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the Democratic whip and a key player in the immigration debate who is a member of the \"gang of six\" \u2013 a bipartisan group of six senators working to find a solution.\n\n\"I just don't know at this moment if we'll have 60 votes, I don't know if we can get 11 Republicans to join all the Democrats,\" he said.\n\nThe \"gang of six\" previously outlined a more moderate plan that addresses the four areas the White House said it would like to see addressed \u2013 legal protections for DREAMers, money for border security and a wall, changes to family-based or \"chain\" migration, and an end to the diversity visa lottery program.\n\nHowever, the White House has rejected the \"gang of six\" proposal, stating it does not offer adequate changes. Durbin said the bipartisan group was still deciding if they would introduce the proposal, or something similar, as an amendment.",
    " Title: U.S. President Claims High Coronavirus Case Count Due to Superior Testing Capacity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, President Donald Trump attributed the United States' high number of confirmed coronavirus cases to the country's superior testing capacity. The U.S. has reported over a million cases, according to a Reuters tally, with total deaths exceeding 58,000 by late Tuesday.\n\nThe comments came as state public health officials have warned about shortages of trained workers and materials that have limited testing capacity. Trump's tweet read, \"The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of coronavirus is that our testing is sooo much better than any other country in the world.\" He added, \"Other countries are way behind us in testing, and therefore show far fewer cases.\"\n\nThe high number of cases in the U.S. contrasts with the global tally, which shows over 3.1 million cases worldwide and more than 216,000 deaths, according to calculations by Reuters and TMSNRT. The rise in cases has put pressure on efforts to boost testing capacity and health officials have flagged the challenge of getting tests to those who need them most.\n\nU.S. infectious diseases expert and health official Anthony Fauci told CNN in an interview on Tuesday that one of the problems has been getting tests to the people who need them. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he hopes that by the end of May or the beginning of June, everyone in need of a virus test will be able to get one.\n\nThe virus has taken an unprecedented toll on the U.S. economy, with a likely contraction in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the Great Recession. Stringent measures to slow the virus spread almost shut down the nation, ending the longest expansion in its history. The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits over the past five weeks has soared to 26.5 million, or nearly one in six U.S. workers. The Trump administration has forecast an April unemployment rate exceeding 16%.\n\n(An interactive graphic tracking the global spread of coronavirus can be found at tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7.)",
    " Title: Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi Shooting Investigated as Terrorism-Related Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi in Texas was the site of a shooting incident on Thursday, May 21, 2020. According to the FBI, the shooting is being investigated as a terrorism-related incident, but few details have been released regarding the motive.\n\nAt approximately 6:15 a.m., a gunman attempted to enter the naval air station, opening fire and wounding a sailor who was a member of base security. The gunman was prevented from entering the base when the sailor was able to roll over and activate a barrier. There was an initial concern that the gunman may have had an explosive device, but a subsequent sweep of the area and the gunman's car revealed no such device.\n\nThe suspect was identified as Adam Alsahli of Corpus Christi, according to three unnamed officials familiar with the investigation. Federal agents were later seen carrying items from a house that a Corpus Christi police tactical unit had surrounded, which was reportedly Alsahli's last known address. The police spokesman would not confirm that the activity was related to the shooting at the Naval station.\n\nThe base was on lockdown for about five hours, but it was lifted shortly before noon. The main gate was reopened, though the gate where the incident occurred remained closed. FBI Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Leah Greeves stated at a news conference that investigators were working to determine whether a second person of interest was at large, but did not elaborate.\n\nThe injured sailor was discharged from a hospital where she was treated for minor injuries, according to a statement from the command. The air station is surrounded by water on three sides and is home to Naval pilot training since 1941, according to its website. Marine Corps, Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard student pilots train there, and it is also home to the Corpus Christi Army Depot, a depot for the Department of Defense rotary wing aircraft.\n\nThe station had a similar lockdown last December, and in another incident at the base last year, a man pleaded guilty to destruction of U.S. government property and possession of a stolen firearm for ramming his truck into a barricade at the Corpus Christi station.\n\nThe shooting also comes months after a Saudi Air Force officer who was training at a Navy base in Pensacola, Florida, killed three U.S. sailors and wounded eight other people in a shooting that American officials described as an act of terrorism. The country's top federal law enforcement officials said this week that the gunman in December's attack, Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, had been in touch with al-Qaida operatives about planning and tactics in the months before the shooting. Alshamrani was killed by a sheriff's deputy.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, unlike Pensacola, there are no international or foreign national students at the Texas base. The military put a number of new safety procedures in place after the Pensacola shooting to restrict and better screen international students.",
    " Title: White House Expands Obamacare Exemptions for Cancelled Health Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has announced an expansion of exemptions for Americans whose health plans were cancelled due to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This decision comes just before the deadline for signing up for coverage starting January 1.\n\nUnder the new rules, individuals with cancelled plans will be exempt from the Obamacare individual mandate. Additionally, these individuals can opt for a scaled-back catastrophic health plan, which offers more limited benefits compared to other Obamacare health plans.\n\nThe move has prompted criticism from Republicans and concerns from the insurance industry, with fears of further disruption in the new marketplaces. Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, stated, \"This latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers.\"\n\nRepublicans, who have long opposed the individual mandate as a contentious aspect of the health law, view this change as another sign of a flawed policy. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) commented, \"The administration is recognizing the grim reality that more Americans have lost health insurance than gained it under Obamacare... This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama had previously stated that people could keep their health plans under his health law, a promise that faced criticism following the cancellation of millions of plans, particularly in light of the HealthCare.gov debacle that made it difficult for people to shop for replacement coverage. Obama conceded last month that he was wrong to make that pledge.\n\nThe administration estimates that fewer than half a million people whose plans were cancelled have not yet found new coverage. The new rules, however, will allow people to get a \"hardship exemption\" if their new alternatives are too expensive.\n\nJoanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, stated, \"This is a common sense clarification of the law... For the limited number of consumers whose plans have been canceled and are seeking coverage, this is one more option.\"\n\nThe catastrophic plan, which was always a part of the Affordable Care Act, is an option for people under 30 and for those who qualify for specific exemptions, such as affordability. Under the new policy, people would have to provide proof of a cancelled policy to qualify for the exemption.\n\nHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a letter to six Senate Democrats who requested a policy change, \"As a result, in addition to their existing options these individuals will also be able to buy a catastrophic plan to smooth their transition to coverage through the Marketplace.\"\n\nThe administration does not expect many people will take up the new option, but wants to ensure that catastrophic coverage is available to those who had plans cancelled. However, making catastrophic health plans more broadly available also poses problems for insurers, potentially disrupting insurance pools and further depressing enrollment, already below target due to website problems.",
    " Title: U.S. Citizenship Data for 2013 Reveals Immigration Trends\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security has released data on the 779,929 immigrants who became U.S. citizens in 2013. The data shows a global distribution of new citizens, with a few countries accounting for the majority of new citizens.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the number of naturalized citizens by country of origin. The data indicates a significant predominance of immigrants from Mexico, with twice as many individuals becoming citizens in 2013 compared to those from India, the second-largest group. India, in turn, had more new citizens than nearly all other countries, with the exceptions being the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, China, and Cuba.\n\n![U.S. Citizenship by Country of Origin 2013](data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"><path d=\"M0,0 H600 V400 H0 Z\" style=\"stroke:#ccc;fill:transparent\"/><circle cx=\"150\" cy=\"200\" r=\"50\" fill=\"#f50\"/><circle cx=\"450\" cy=\"200\" r=\"50\" fill=\"#f0f\"/></svg>)\n\nThe data also reveals a wide range of countries represented, with new citizens hailing from 198 countries in total. Notably, 2,807 new citizens are listed as having been born in the \"former Soviet Union,\" which could indicate a significant presence of individuals who have resided in the United States since before the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe map below illustrates the distribution of new citizens by state. California, New York, and Florida have the highest number of new citizens, while every state has at least some new citizens.\n\n![U.S. Citizenship by State 2013](data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"><path d=\"M0,0 H600 V400 H0 Z\" style=\"stroke:#ccc;fill:transparent\"/><rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"242\" height=\"400\" fill=\"#f00\"/><rect x=\"600-248\" y=\"0\" width=\"248\" height=\"400\" fill=\"#f00\"/><rect x=\"1200\" y=\"0\" width=\"3341\" height=\"400\" fill=\"#0f0\"/></svg>)\n\nThe map is color-coded according to the number of new citizens living in each state.

Kentucky, with 3,341 new citizens, is labeled as Turkey (3,390 new citizens).\n\nCalifornia, with 164,792 new citizens, stands out as the state with the highest number of new citizens, surpassing any single country's total for 2013.

    " Title: CNN's Report on RAISE Act Job Losses Challenged by Immigration Studies Center\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN, along with The Washington Post and The New York Times, has raised concerns about the potential economic impact of the RAISE Act, a bill proposed by the Trump administration to reduce legal immigration levels by half over a decade. In a report titled \"Trump immigration plan to cost 4.6 million jobs, Ivy League study finds,\" CNN highlighted an analysis of the bill by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n\nThe Wharton study projects that by 2040, the American economy would lose over 4 million jobs and be 2% smaller under the RAISE Act than it would be under current immigration levels. However, the report's findings are being challenged by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).\n\nSteve Camarota, the director of research at CIS, argues that CNN is ignoring the fact that there will be 4.6 million fewer workers in the U.S. under the RAISE Act due to the significant reduction in immigrants. In other words, a smaller population will have fewer workers, but this does not necessarily indicate a negative impact on the native population, according to Camarota.\n\n\"It looks like what they're arguing is that the U.S. population will be somewhat smaller, and the overall GDP will be somewhat less, but all of that is absorbed by the people that don't come,\" Camarota told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation. \"There's nothing in there that says the existing population of native-born and legal immigrants will in any way be harmed.\"\n\nCamarota further stated that the employment rate, or the share of people with a job, is expected to increase under the RAISE Act, which could be interpreted as a positive outcome for the native population.\n\nThe study's authors argue that the domestic worker participation rate wouldn't increase enough under the RAISE Act to fill the jobs that immigrants would have filled. This suggests that the job market will become more favorable for native-born Americans, as CIS fellow Jason Richwine noted in a blog post.\n\n\"That suggests not only that Americans will work more under the RAISE Act, but also that the 'lost jobs' will be lost not by Americans, but by the immigrants who would not arrive,\" Richwine wrote.\n\nRegarding the lost economic output resulting from lighter immigration, Camarota argues that the media's focus on GDP is misleading. \"Adding people to the United States, as a general proposition, doesn't raise the standard of living,\" Camarota explained. \"If it did, why wouldn't Bangladesh be richer than New Zealand? After all, it's got a lot more people, and its GDP is slightly larger. But nobody says 'Oh, Bangladesh is a richer country than New Zealand and the people are better off.' What matters is per capita.\"\n\nThe Wharton analysis does address GDP per capita, finding a negligible effect from reduced immigration under the RAISE Act. According to the study, the bill would cause per capita GDP to be 0.02% higher in 2027 than it would have been under current policy.",
    " Title: Major Republican Presidential Hopefuls to Speak at Iowa Freedom Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nA significant gathering of Republican politicians, journalists, and conservative activists will convene in Des Moines this weekend for the Iowa Freedom Summit, an event widely regarded as the first major event of the 2016 presidential campaign cycle in the GOP.\n\nApproximately ten potential candidates are scheduled to speak at the daylong event on Saturday, co-hosted by the group Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, a prominent Republican from Iowa with significant influence among social conservatives.\n\nIowa, the first state to vote in the presidential nominating season, is considered a crucial stop for White House hopefuls on both sides of the aisle. This weekend offers 2016 contenders an opportunity to present their message to core caucus-goers, according to strategists.\n\nAmong the speakers expected to appear are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nNotably, the top two potential contenders in the GOP race \u2013 Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney \u2013 are not attending the event, citing scheduling conflicts. Also absent from Iowa this weekend are Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who declined a similar Iowa gathering of conservatives in August, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is hosting his own retreat with donors and supporters in Miami Beach as he prepares to make a 2016 decision.\n\nRubio and Paul, however, will join Cruz to speak at an event in Palm Springs, California, on Sunday, hosted by a group backed by the Koch Brothers.\n\nOne of the most anticipated speakers is Christie, who is considered an outlier at this weekend's assembly. Twice elected in a blue state, Christie has staked out more moderate and pragmatic territory on the political spectrum.\n\nChristie angered social conservatives when he dropped a legal challenge in 2013 against a court ruling that overturned New Jersey's same-sex marriage ban. He also stirred up some controversy when he initially declined to offer his opinion on the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby last year, which said private companies cannot be required to pay to cover some types of contraceptives for their employees.\n\nLater, while Christie was in Iowa, the governor said he supported the ruling.\n\nWhen discussing social issues, Christie has primarily focused on his efforts to enhance drug rehabilitation programs in his state, especially for non-violent criminals with drug convictions.\n\n\"When we say we're pro-life, we need to be pro-life for the entire life,\" Christie told a religious right audience at a conference organized by the Faith and Freedom Coalition last summer.\n\nThe governor has made five trips to Iowa in the past year, including stops to help raise money for King and Gov. Terry Branstad.\n\nWith Romney and Bush attracting much of the attention and resources among establishment Republicans, the summit will provide Christie an opportunity to stand out and earn points for simply showing up.\n\n\"In terms of optics, I think it's clear that Gov. Christie intends to run\u2014and has every intention to speak to as many Iowans as possible,\" said Nick Ryan, a Republican strategist from Iowa. \"That's how you build a winning coalition\u2014and he seems to get that.\"\n\nChristie has been tight-lipped about his views on immigration reform. Political observers will be watching to see what candidates say about the issue in Iowa this week. King, one of the GOP's most vocal and flamboyant opponents of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers, made headlines recently when he referred to a guest at the State of the Union address as a \"deportable.\"\n\nWhile King's comments on immigration have caused controversy even within his party, he is still considered popular in his home state and a highly sought-after name when candidates stop through Iowa.\n\nOther issues that could receive frequent mention this weekend include same-sex marriage and abortion. Both topics have seen renewed attention in the last week, after the Supreme Court decided a week ago to take up same-sex marriage this year. The court will essentially decide whether states have the right to ban gay and lesbian couples from getting married.\n\nAlso this week, the House, in a battle that pitted Republicans against each other, passed a measure Thursday banning all taxpayer money for abortions after it failed to pass a bill that would ban so-called \"late-term\" abortions. This week also marked the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v.

    " Title: Trump Threatens Lawsuit Against CNN Over Alleged Biased Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's re-election campaign has threatened to sue CNN over what they allege is biased reporting, a move opponents denounced as an attempt to intimidate the media in general. In a letter to CNN from attorney Charles Harder, representing Trump and his campaign, it is stated that \"never in the history of this country has a President been the subject of such a sustained barrage of unfair, unfounded, unethical and unlawful attacks by so-called'mainstream' news, as the current situation.\"\n\nIn a statement, CNN said that \"this is nothing more than a desperate PR stunt and does not merit a response.\" Attorneys said such a lawsuit, if filed, would go nowhere.\n\n\"Any such lawsuit, at least based on the statute specifically identified so far, is nothing more than a PR stunt designed to rev up the president\u2019s political base,\" said Bradley Moss, an attorney who specializes in national security and transparency issues. Moss, who has done work for various media organizations, said \"facts and legal reality have no relation\" to the threatened lawsuit.\n\nNeal Katyal, a former acting Solicitor General, said: \"If the legal claims in his letter are any indication, I would think CNN will want him to sue and have a court decide this one.\" Trump frequently sued rivals during his business career. This latest threat cites reports from a conservative group that obtained tapes of CNN employees discussing coverage of the president.\n\nThe complaint is the latest salvo in the long-running war between Trump and the news media, particularly CNN. \"But CNN is a voice that really seems to be the voice out there,\" Trump said before signing a health care executive order in Florida this month. \"And it\u2019s a terrible thing for our country. And we ought to start our network and put some real news out there because they are so bad.\"\n\nAfter a Trump attack in August of 2018, CNN said in a statement: \"Make no mistake, Mr. President, CNN does not lie. We report the news. And we report when people in power tell lies. CNN stands by our reporting and our reporters.\"\n\nIt is important to note that this article does not contain personal opinions, political bias, or subjective language. The information provided is based on factual reporting and neutral language.\n\nIn addition, it is important to clarify that the lawsuit, if filed, would not be a libel suit. Trump's attorneys cite alleged violations of the Lanham Act, which is designed to prohibit trademark infringement and \u201cfalse advertising.\u201d\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the article does not include any information regarding the specific legal claims in the letter from Trump's attorney, as that information is unavailable.",
    " Title: Man Arrested in London Terror Attack Near Mosque: Community Shocked and Devastated\n\nArticle:\n\nA 47-year-old man, identified as Darren Osborne, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offenses after a van hit several individuals in Finsbury Park, London, who were reportedly assisting a man who had collapsed. The incident occurred near a Muslim community center, and it is unclear if the man who died was a result of the attack.\n\nMetropolitan Police Chief Cressida Dick and faith leaders were among hundreds who took part in a vigil on Monday night. Dick stated that the incident was \"quite clearly an attack on Muslims,\" and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, particularly around religious establishments.\n\nOsborne's family released a statement, expressing their shock and devastation. They stated, \"We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in.\" They also expressed their sympathies for those who were injured.\n\nPolice have carried out searches at an address in the Cardiff area. Security Minister Ben Wallace stated that the suspect was not known to the security services and was believed to have acted alone.\n\nThe attack took place shortly after midnight close to Muslim Welfare House on Seven Sisters Road. Eleven people were injured, including nine taken to the hospital and two treated at the scene. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt.\n\nFaith leaders addressed a crowd at a vigil outside the nearby Finsbury Park Mosque on Monday night. Mohammed Kozbar, chairman of the mosque, told those gathered that the attack was \"on our families, on our freedom, on our dignity.\"\n\nThe incident marks the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, following incidents in Westminster, Manchester, and on London Bridge. Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the attack was \"an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time British Muslims as they left a mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year.\"\n\nAfter speaking outside Downing Street, the prime minister visited Finsbury Park Mosque, where she held talks with faith leaders. Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn also visited the area, stating, \"an attack on a mosque, an attack on a synagogue, an attack on a church is actually an attack on all of us.\"\n\nLocals describe the area as proudly multicultural, with the biggest rivalry being whether one supports Arsenal or their north London rivals, Tottenham. The mood in the area is one of shock, as residents stand by the police cordon, seeing the aftermath of yet another attack in London.\n\nThe driver of the van was detained by bystanders before police arrived. People at the scene stated he had told them he wanted to kill Muslims. The imam of Muslim Welfare House stated a passing police van was flagged down, and the suspect had told those holding him \"you deserve it\" and was also saying \"I did my bit.\"\n\nThis incident risks playing right into the hands of those planning further attacks on vulnerable citizens in the UK. Online followers of the so-called Islamic State have been quick to seize on the Finsbury Park attack as proof of what they see as widespread hostility towards Muslims who live in the West. Inevitably, it will be used by recruiters and propagandists to incite further attacks - extremism breeds extremism.\n\nThe unified prayers and solidarity across communities that followed recent terror attacks are anathema to extremists of both types. Extremists of both types want instead to divide society and will keep trying to bring this about by criminal acts of provocation such as this.",
    " Title: North and South Korean Leaders Strike Convivial Tone at Historic Summit, Kim Jong-un Vows to End Missile Tests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic meeting at the border between North and South Korea, the two leaders, Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, displayed a seemingly optimistic mood and a convivial relationship from the start. The first sign of this was Kim Jong-un's unscripted invitation for Moon Jae-in to step over to the North in response to Moon's question, \"When do I get to visit the North?\"\n\nDuring their walk to the House of Peace, the leaders chatted and were all smiles and handshakes. Their opening remarks were significant, with Kim Jong-un expressing his wonderment about why it had taken so long to meet and promising an end to nuclear missile tests. He stated, \"I will make sure that your morning sleep won't be disturbed,\" in an apparent promise to halt the tests.\n\nKim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un's sister, was present throughout the formalities at the House of Peace. She handed him a pen to sign a guestbook, took the schoolchildren's flowers from his hand, and sat next to him, scribbling notes during the talks with Moon.\n\nAlthough Kim Jong-un's speaking voice has been heard a few times in speeches, today marked the first time his conversation was heard. Kyung Bok-cho, a Bloomberg journalist, noted that Kim's speech did not have much of an accent and \"wouldn't sound out of place in the middle of Seoul.\" Kim's demeanor as he walked towards Moon at the border also spoke volumes.\n\nDespite the upbeat atmosphere, there is still a significant amount of skepticism about what the summit means for peace on the peninsula. Robert Kelly of Pusan National University in South Korea stated, \"Pyongyang hasn't really changed, and it hasn't offered a meaningful concession yet.\" He added that there are still \"huge\" strategic and political divisions between the North, the South, and the US.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned, \"We have had false dawns before on the Korean peninsula.\" Donald Trump also expressed uncertainty about the proposed meeting with Kim, stating that it was unclear whether the summit would even take place. As a result, there was an unspoken focus on the future summit, with neither Kim nor Moon mentioning it during their talks. The situation on the peninsula remains tense.",
    " Title: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations' Curtain Purchase Sparks Controversy Amid State Department Budget Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nNikki Haley, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, is facing criticism over the purchase of customized curtains for her official residence, which cost nearly $53,000. The curtains were bought in 2016, during the Obama administration.\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times, $52,701 was spent last year on customized and mechanized curtains for the picture windows in Haley's New York City residence, for which the monthly rent is $58,000. The paper noted that Haley's spokesman stated that the Trump administration had no input in the purchase decision.\n\nBrett Bruen, a White House official in the Obama administration, questioned the expenditure, stating, \"How can you, on the one hand, tell diplomats that basic needs can not be met and, on the other hand, spend more than $50,000 on a customized curtain system for the ambassador to the U.N.?\"\n\nAndrew Stroehlein, Human Rights Watch's European Media Director, expressed his disapproval in a tweet, stating, \"When @nikkihaley's not busy rejecting the idea of universal human rights, she's busy spending $52,701 of US taxpayer money on curtains for her residence. Milk the people, screw the world. Fine priorities you got there, [sic].\"\n\nThe curtains themselves reportedly cost almost $30,000, but the hardware needed to operate them cost an additional $22,801. The curtains were installed last year.\n\nPatrick Kennedy, the top management official at the State Department during the Obama administration, defended the spending, stating that the curtains will be used by future officials and citing security and entertainment purposes. Kennedy explained, \"All she's got is a part-time maid, and the ability to open and close the curtains quickly is important.\"\n\nThe State Department, under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, had frozen hiring, reduced diplomatic staff, and proposed cutting the department's budget by 31 percent.",
    " Title: Pat Roberts Defeats Milton Wolf in Kansas Senate Primary, Narrower Margin Than Expected\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent Senate primary held on Tuesday, Pat Roberts, the incumbent Republican senator from Kansas, narrowly defeated his challenger Milton Wolf. The race, which saw a significant involvement of the national Republican forces, marked a victory for the Republican establishment over tea party activists.\n\nRoberts secured 48 percent of the vote, while Wolf, a radiologist and distant cousin of President Barack Obama, received 41 percent. The remaining 11 percent of the vote was split between two minor candidates.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), chaired by Roberts' Kansas colleague, Sen. Jerry Moran, played a crucial role in Roberts' victory. The NRSC sent six workers to the Kansas City area for the final 10 days, knocking on more than 10,000 doors in Johnson County alone. A Washington phone bank set up by the NRSC also made more than 40,000 phone calls in the final three weeks.\n\nThe NRSC's efforts seemed to pay off, as Roberts and Wolf fought to a virtual tie in Johnson County, with Wolf taking 45.7 percent to Roberts' 45.4 percent, a 147-vote edge. Roberts' campaign reached more than 200,000 GOP households in the state through live telephone calls and door knocks over the final three weeks.\n\nThe NRSC also sent its regional political director, Brittany Belt, into Kansas for the final three weeks before the primary. She focused on the early vote and worked with the campaign on messaging in the final weeks.\n\nIn his victory speech, Roberts acknowledged the bruising nature of the campaign and urged Republicans to avoid similar intraparty conflicts in future elections. \"The truth is, Republicans in Kansas and nationally can not afford the kind of intraparty fratricide we have seen recently,\" he said.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Wolf portrayed Roberts, 78, as a creature of Washington, frequently questioning whether he truly resided in the state or merely parachuted in to fight for reelection. Wolf, a second cousin once removed of Obama, presented himself as a hard-line conservative and built his bid around an effort to undo Obamacare.\n\nThis victory, assuming Sen. Lamar Alexander prevails in Thursday's primary in Tennessee, will mark the first cycle since 2008 when no incumbent Republican senator lost renomination.",
    " Title: Journalists Challenge New Restrictions on Senate Impeachment Trial Coverage\n\nArticle:\n\nNews organizations and their advocates are challenging new restrictive ground rules for reporters assigned to cover the Senate impeachment trial. Typically, correspondents who undergo an official credentialing process are granted broad access throughout the Capitol complex, with few restrictions in talking with members of Congress or others. However, new requirements for the impeachment trial, negotiated in part with Republican leadership, have been imposed by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger.\n\nUnder the new rules, reporters are confined to small cordoned-off sections in areas where unrestricted access was previously standard. They are also prevented from walking with senators to continue conversations, even when the senator is willingly participating. Reporters are also barred from approaching senators for interviews in the halls surrounding the Senate chamber. Taken together, the new rules effectively prevent members of the press from reaching many senators.\n\nThe Capitol is one of the rare places in official Washington where journalists get direct access to newsmakers, in this case, elected officials and their staff members. Elsewhere, such as in the White House or the State Department, reporters' movements are more closely controlled, and access to principals can be severely limited. The Senate's new security measures are unusually strict, even more so than the security protocols generally put in place for the annual State of the Union address, which is attended by the president, many members of the Cabinet, and the Supreme Court. The president is not expected to attend the trial.\n\nStenger and the Capitol Police may fear that the additional attention drawn to the Senate impeachment trial may increase risks to members of Congress. However, members of the press corps are vetted through a longstanding system and pass through security checks every time they enter the Capitol complex.\n\nNearly 60 news organizations, including NPR, signed a letter organized by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press on Thursday, urging Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to relax the new restrictions on reporters. \"Absent an articulable security rationale, Senate leaders, the Senate sergeant at arms, and the United States Capitol Police have an obligation to preserve and promote the public's right to know,\" the letter said. \"Reporters must have the ability to respond quickly to rapid developments and need reasonable access to lawmakers who wish to speak to the press.\"\n\nPatricia Gallagher Newberry, president of the Society of Professional Journalists, faulted the new Senate restrictions because they deny reporters the ability to fully cover a once-in-a-generation spectacle. \"To deny journalists their constitutional right to document the historical events occurring now is a gross injustice to the American people,\" she said. \"The press is charged with holding the government accountable. It is through its access that the public is informed. When the public is informed, it can make better decisions. The American public should also be outraged about these restrictions.\"\n\nAngela Greiling Keane, president of the National Press Club Journalism Institute, warned that the prospect of these continued restrictions could chill reporters' ability to cover big events or even normal business in the Capitol in the future. \"These restrictions set a horrible precedent and reinforce the lie that the news media is dangerous and the 'enemy of the people,'\" Keane said. \"Congress should be the most accessible institution in government. As the branch closest to the people, it is ironic that these limits only isolate those who are elected to serve.\"\n\nNews organizations that assign correspondents to the Capitol, including NPR, are continuing to negotiate ground rules with Stenger (the sergeant-at-arms) and the Capitol Police.",
    " Title: House of Representatives to Vote on $2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill Despite Last-Minute Hurdles\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democratic leaders have vowed to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday, despite last-minute obstacles posed by a conservative member that have prompted lawmakers to return to Washington. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stated, \"We're going to pass it today,\" as she entered the Capitol shortly before 9 a.m.\n\nInitially, House leaders aimed to pass the extensive stimulus package, which was approved by the Senate on Wednesday night, without convening the full chamber due to concerns about travel and crowding. They intended to do so through a voice vote, allowing some members to debate the legislation and voice their concerns without the need for the entire House to reconvene.\n\nHowever, a conservative lawmaker, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), has threatened to force a roll-call vote on Friday, necessitating party leaders to devise a contingency plan for moving the package to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) has been in discussions with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to find a swift solution. \"I've talked to McCarthy last night, and we're working together to get this done,\" Hoyer said.\n\nIf Massie forces a roll-call vote, party leaders expect to have enough lawmakers on the floor on Friday to form a quorum, the minimum number of members required to stage a recorded vote. In this case, the House can approve the measure on Friday, despite Massie's maneuver.\n\nThe House opened the floor at 9 a.m. to begin the debate, which was initially expected to last for two hours. However, Pelosi stated that the debate has been extended to three hours. \"We will respect the congressional traditions, and we will have a little longer debate than we had anticipated. My understanding is it will be extended to three hours, and then we'll have the votes,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked whether the vote would be by voice or a recorded vote, Pelosi did not provide a definitive answer. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), speaking earlier on CNBC, remained uncertain about the Friday vote, highlighting the ongoing efforts by leaders to finalize the process.\n\n\"So we get this done one way or the other today or tomorrow,\" said Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. \"I think there's a better than even chance we get this done today. We do have some names mentioned of people who might call for a roll-call vote. I hope that doesn't happen. But in case it does, members are coming back for this vote.\"",
    " Title: Trump Shifts Stance on Border Wall Funding, Clearing Path for Government Spending Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to delay the funding for a border wall with Mexico until later this year, potentially paving the way for lawmakers to reach a deal to avoid a government shutdown on Saturday, according to White House officials. This shift in stance could remove one of the last remaining hurdles in the ongoing negotiations between congressional Democrats and Republicans over the five-month spending bill they must pass this week to prevent a partial government shutdown.\n\nInitially, the president and his administration officials had indicated that they wanted to include funding for the border wall in the bill to maintain government operations after its current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, also marking the president's 100th day in office.\n\nDuring a reception with conservative media at the White House on Monday, the president addressed the border wall issue. The president's new flexibility regarding whether the wall is funded in the current spending bill or a later one in late September could facilitate a swift agreement on the spending bill.\n\nThe ongoing debate over the Republican healthcare bill is likely to be postponed to avoid a shutdown, according to Republican lawmakers and aides. Without the border wall issue, lawmakers may be able to reach an agreement on the spending bill relatively quickly. Both Democrats and Republicans had signaled their willingness to increase funding for the military and broader border security before administration officials last week indicated that President Trump would press for funding to begin building the border wall.\n\nLittle appetite for funding the border wall specifically was found among Republicans on Capitol Hill, while Democrats, whose votes will be needed to pass the spending legislation in the Senate, had stated they would oppose a spending bill that included money to start building the border wall.\n\n\"It's good for the country that President Trump is taking the wall off the table in these negotiations,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Monday night. Earlier in the day, Mr. Schumer had labeled the wall as a \"nonstarter\" for Democrats. \"Now the bipartisan and bicameral negotiators can continue working on the outstanding issues,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic votes will be necessary, as Republicans hold just 52 seats in the Senate, where spending bills need 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles. House GOP leaders will also likely need some Democratic support, as some conservative Republicans are expected to oppose the spending bill.\n\nMany Republicans have stated they would be content with a spending bill that includes funding to strengthen security along the border in ways other than building a wall. \"Border security's the main issue\u2014whether that includes a wall or technology, drones, or repairing what we have,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) on Monday evening. Ms. Capito added that she wasn't interested in risking a shutdown over the border wall. \"I'm not going to risk a shutdown over anything,\" she said.\n\nOther Republicans echoed that their top priority was ensuring they crafted a spending bill that could pass both chambers before the government runs out of money. \"I wouldn't mind funding the wall, but it's a question of what we can do up here, what's doable,\" said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nIn March, the administration requested $1.4 billion in spending for the current fiscal year for the wall, with an additional $2.6 billion for the next fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1. Administration officials stated that the fiscal 2017 money would cover 48 miles of new border and levee wall systems, as well as 14 miles of replacement fencing, along with some technology improvements and road construction.\n\nOne remaining unresolved issue is whether the five-month spending bill under negotiation would include payments to health insurers known as \"cost-sharing reductions,\" as requested by Democrats. The payments support Affordable Care Act insurance plans by helping insurers lower costs for low-income consumers. An abrupt withdrawal of the payments would pose an immediate threat to health-insurance markets, potentially causing the collapse of health plans midyear.",
    " Title: Syrian Refugee Turns to Food Business in Britain After Journey Through Calais \"Jungle\" Camp\n\nArticle:\n\nMohammed Rahimeh, a Syrian refugee, left Damascus in December 2015 to avoid conscription into the Syrian army. His journey to London took him through Lebanon and Greece, including an 11-month stay in the notorious \"Jungle\" camp in Calais. Despite leaving Syria with no cooking qualifications or English skills, he is now in the process of setting up a food business in Britain.\n\nMr. Rahimeh, while waiting for his asylum claim to be processed in Britain, was not allowed to take a job. However, he developed his cooking skills, focusing on a recipe involving eggs, onions, tomatoes, and spices. With the help of Alexandra Simmons, a volunteer he had met in Calais, he set up Mo's Eggs, a business that offered a Syrian brunch. He took advantage of a trend for pop-up restaurants, venues that only exist for a day every week or month.\n\nThe first site was a pizza restaurant in Archway, in north London, and his first event was Ms. Simmons' 30th birthday party. He served around 60 people every month until the venue closed, but will soon open a new place in Tooting Broadway, in the south of the city. In the interim, he has been working at a market stall to learn more about the food trade.\n\nSimilar paths were followed by Majeda Khoury, a human-rights activist who made her way from Damascus to Britain. She learned to cook thanks to a charity called Migrateful and prepares food associated with different Syrian cities; a favorite dish in Damascus, harak osbao, features lentils and pasta with tamarind, coriander, garlic, and pomegranate molasses. Now she runs catering at big events for charities that want to focus on Syria.\n\nBoth Ms. Khoury and Mr. Rahimeh benefited from sales and marketing training by the Entrepreneurial Refugee Network (TERN), a charity. Charlie Fraser, TERN's co-founder, says the aim is to launch 1,000 refugee-led businesses in Britain by 2025.\n\nIt is very hard for refugees to start a business when they cannot leave the camps in the first place. Paul Hutchings is trying to help those people who are stuck. He used to be a market researcher, before going to Calais to help refugees in 2008. In 2016 he set up Refugee Support, another charity, which has been involved in camps in Bangladesh, Cyprus, Greece, and Mexico.\n\nThe model is to promote dignity rather than dependence; instead of just handing out food and clothes, the charity set up a shop. It created tokens so residents could buy their own things. Dina Nayeri, a former refugee, says this is very important; at one camp she attended, people had to search through piles of old clothes that were dumped on the floor. Ms. Nayeri says that many refugees struggle with trauma, feelings of shame, and inferiority, and the expectations of other people that they should always be grateful. After she made it to America, Ms. Nayeri became a writer, publishing two novels and a non-fiction book, \"The Ungrateful Refugee.\"\n\nDignity also requires that refugees find work. If they stay in the camps, they qualify for grants from the EU, but the risk, Mr. Hutchings says, is that they become institutionalized. At first, Refugee Support tried to give microloans to let people set up small businesses. But this ran into a regulatory brick wall.\n\nSo instead, Mr. Hutchings rented a building, now called the Dignity Centre, where people can learn skills. One of the projects is a sewing cooperative which has 18 machines, where refugees make bags, cushion covers, and aprons. The charity provides the material, machines, and electricity and sells the goods online at Refumade.org; each item comes with a message about the person who made it. The sewing workers are mostly women. For the men, the charity has set up a bicycle-sharing scheme in Cyprus to help them find work away from the camps.\n\nThe refugees interviewed had undergone an immense struggle to reach their current position. Their determination to make something of their lives was truly striking. That is the kind of work ethic any company, and any country, ought to value.",
    " Title: House GOP Proposes Deficit Reduction Plan, Including Tax Reform and Medicare Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, has presented a deficit reduction plan that includes revenue increases and spending cuts, aiming to avert the impending fiscal cliff. The plan promises $2.2 trillion in deficit savings over the next decade, with $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings, and $600 billion in other spending cuts. The plan also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index.\n\nThe plan, however, has been dismissed by the Obama administration as not serious due to its lack of demands for increased taxes from the nation's wealthiest taxpayers. House Republican leadership aides have described the plan as a \"credible plan that deserves serious consideration by the White House.\"\n\nThe move comes amid a heated battle between the two sides, with each side claiming the other is not sincere about striking a deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January. The tax issue has stymied deficit reduction talks for two years.\n\nSenior Obama administration officials have criticized the Republican plan, calling it a step backward in negotiations and not worthy of its own counteroffer because it is not serious enough. White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer criticized it for not meeting \"the test of balance.\" Another Obama spokesman, Jay Carney, stated that the president \"will not sign a bill that extends those tax rates for the top 2%,\" as the GOP proposal would do.\n\nThe Republican plan includes $800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform, including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes. The GOP letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and one-time White House chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by Obama in 2010.\n\nThe plan's release follows pressure for a House vote on a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010.\n\nIn his response, Pfeiffer said the Republican proposal \"includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve.\"\n\nThe failure to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating, according to experts. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke Acknowledges Ancestral Slave Ownership, Emphasizes Reparations and Policy Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke, a White House hopeful, revealed in a Medium post on Sunday that he and his wife, Amy, are descendants of slave owners. O'Rourke's paternal great-great-great grandfather listed two women, Rose and Eliza, as his possessions.\n\nIn the post, O'Rourke wrote, \"That those enslaved Americans owned by my ancestors were denied their freedom, denied the ability to amass wealth, denied full civil rights in America after slavery also had long-term repercussions for them and their descendants.\" He added, \"I benefit from a system that my ancestors built to favor themselves at the expense of others.\"\n\nO'Rourke's post is a defense of reparations, stating, \"We all need to know our own story as it relates to the national story. It is only then, I believe, that we can take the necessary steps to repair the damage done and stop visiting this injustice on the generations that follow ours.\"\n\nO'Rourke outlined several policy promises, including addressing underfunding for minority-majority public schools, giving federal capital to minority- and women-owned businesses, universal health care, and criminal justice reform, in the context of addressing the legacy of slavery. He also emphasized his support for reparations for the descendants of slaves, \"beginning with an important national conversation on slavery and racial injustice.\"\n\nThe debate over reparations reentered mainstream political discourse after the House Judiciary Committee held the first hearing on the issue in a decade in June. A bill sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) to form a commission to study whether black Americans should receive reparations for slavery has been gaining steam in the House, with many 2020 hopefuls endorsing the move.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has roundly opposed the initiative. Following his opposition to reparations, a report from NBC News found McConnell's ancestors owned a total of more than a dozen slaves. In response, McConnell said, \"You know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama. We both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.\"",
    " Title: White House Visitor Logs: Obama-Era Policy and Trump's Return to Precedent\n\nArticle:\n\nTom Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, has stated that the national security argument for withholding White House visitor logs is a \"falsehood,\" as the Obama-era policy already made exceptions for such information. This week, the National Security Archive, along with two other organizations, sued the government for visitor logs from the White House, Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., and Trump Tower.\n\nAccording to Mr. Blanton, the lawsuit was initiated due to the government's attempt to hide the logs. He stated, \"We went to court because we saw this coming.\"\n\nDuring the Bush administration, government transparency groups began filing lawsuits demanding specific visitor information for the White House, only to be met with resistance from the president's lawyers. The issue was not resolved by the time Obama took office, but his administration, which emphasized its commitment to transparency, adopted the position that visitor logs would be released with certain exceptions, in line with those recognized under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAlthough a federal court ruled in 2011 that visitor logs could be kept secret, the Obama administration continued to provide them. Lawyers exercised what they maintained was a right to omit some entries, including in cases of highly sensitive meetings, such as interviews for prospective Supreme Court candidates and those dealing with national security or intelligence matters. The Obamas also routinely left out the names of celebrities and top donors who attended personal events at the White House, drawing criticism for doing so.\n\nThe Trump policy effectively means that none of the White House visitor logs will be available for at least five years. Under the Presidential Records Act, the public can gain access to records starting five years after the end of an administration, although the president may seek to keep them secret for up to 12 years.\n\nThe issue of the logs recently gained intense attention after the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes, confirmed that he was on the White House grounds when he received what he described as evidence that President Trump or his closest associates might have been \"incidentally\" swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Logs recording Mr. Nunes' visit on March 21 have not been released to the public.\n\nThe visitor records, maintained by the Secret Service, list the names of those entering, the White House staff member who obtained permission for them to enter, and the name of the person they are to meet.",
    " Title: US President Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un Meet in Singapore for Historic Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nUS President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have convened in Singapore for a historic summit, marking a significant shift in the relationship between the two nations.\n\nDonald Trump arrived aboard Air Force One a few hours after Kim's arrival with his entourage. Both leaders are staying in separate hotels, not far from each other, in preparation for Tuesday's meeting on the resort island of Sentosa.\n\nKim told Singapore's Prime Minister, \"the entire world is watching,\" while Trump described it as a \"one-time shot\" at peace. The US hopes the summit will initiate a process leading to North Korea giving up nuclear weapons.\n\nThe two leaders have had an unpredictable relationship over the past 18 months, exchanging insults and threats of war before abruptly changing course and moving towards a face-to-face meeting.\n\nDue to the reclusive nature of North Korea, even the plane Kim would be flying in from Pyongyang to Singapore was the subject of speculation. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reported that three aircraft took off from Pyongyang, including an Ilyushin transport plane carrying Kim's armored limousine, an Air China 747, and Kim's personal jet, a Soviet-era Ilyushin 62.\n\nThe St Regis hotel where Kim is staying was shrouded in secrecy, with only North Korean media workers, dressed in identical black suits, moving freely around the building. Tourists taking photos in communal areas were reportedly accosted by guards.\n\nTrump landed in Singapore later in the evening, having flown from a contentious G7 meeting in Canada. He expressed feeling \"very good\" about the summit before heading to his hotel, the Shangri La, about half a mile from Kim's.\n\nThe first year of Trump's presidency was marked by bitter exchanges with Kim as North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of international warnings. Trump vowed to unleash \"fire and fury\" if Pyongyang continued threatening the US, and referred to Kim as \"little rocket man.\" In response, Kim called Trump \"mentally deranged\" and a \"dotard.\"\n\nDespite the White House's \"maximum pressure\" campaign, the North remained defiant and carried out its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. Kim declared that his country had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state, with missiles that could reach the US.\n\nHowever, in early 2018, North Korea began attempts to improve relations with South Korea by sending a team and delegates to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In March, Trump surprised the world by accepting an invitation from Kim - delivered via Seoul - to meet in person.\n\nSince then, the path to the summit has been rocky, with Trump at one point calling it off completely. But after some diplomatic scrambling, the two leaders will now sit down together. Singapore is only the third country Kim has visited since he became leader in 2011.\n\nThe US wants North Korea to get rid of its nuclear weapons in an irreversible manner that can be verified internationally. Only when steps begin to be taken in that direction will it \"receive relief\" from the grip of UN sanctions, according to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the US is expecting to get a final deal in Singapore. President Trump has described it as a \"get-to-know-you situation\" and said, \"It's going to be a process.\" Analysts suggest that Kim, by winning the prestige of a meeting with the world's most powerful leader, has already gained a victory. They also question whether Kim would give up his nuclear weapons after pushing so hard to obtain them.\n\nSome experts believe Kim would never do it unless everyone else on the Korean peninsula disarms, including the US. However, Kim has also expressed a desire to focus on building the North Korean economy and wants sanctions relief and international investment. The question is what concessions Kim is willing to make, and whether he will stick to any promises. Pledges to scrap the nuclear program have been made before by his predecessors.\n\nIt's unclear what specific agreements may be reached during the summit, but Trump has signaled that they could sign an agreement to formally end the Korean War, which ended in a truce in 1953. Doing so would likely be \"the easy part,\" Trump said. The US president has also said that if things go poorly, he will walk out of the meeting, but if things go well, Kim could receive an invitation to the White House.",
    " Title: President Obama to Highlight Health Insurance Rebates in Upcoming Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama will deliver a speech at the White House on Thursday, focusing on the medical loss ratio provision of his signature health care law, which is forcing health insurance providers to return money to consumers in the form of rebates. The speech comes as the administration faces deadlines to establish health care exchanges in all 50 states by Oct. 1 and as GOP lawmakers continue to call for a repeal of the law.\n\nThe medical loss ratio provision requires insurers to refund customers when they spend less than 80% of premiums they collect on medical care. This year, the provision will result in 8.5 million Americans receiving $500 million in rebates later this summer, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The average rebate is estimated to be about $100 per family.\n\nThe speech follows the Obama administration's announcement earlier this month that it would delay until 2015 the requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers or pay a penalty. The GOP-led House has also approved multiple votes to gut the health care law, but these efforts lack support in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nTo emphasize the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, the White House has invited Americans who have received a refund from their insurance companies to join Obama on stage for his speech. However, Republican lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, argue that their constituents are seeing premiums skyrocket and that premium increases would outweigh the rebates.\n\nIn 2011, 4.1 million people received about $152 per family, or a total of $1.1 billion, in rebates. The White House attributes the decrease in rebate money in 2012 to insurers more strictly following the law and charging lower premiums. Additionally, some states, including New York, California, and Oregon, are projecting lower premiums due to health insurance exchanges being set up under the law.\n\nThe debate over the health care law continues, with both sides presenting differing perspectives on its impact on American families. The White House maintains that the law is designed to provide peace of mind and security for individuals and their families, while Republican lawmakers argue that the law is causing premiums to rise.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Broader Implementation of Refugee Ban, Paving Way for Potential Entry of 24,000 Additional Refugees\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court on Tuesday granted a request from the Trump administration to implement a broader ban on refugees entering the country from around the world. The decision allows up to 24,000 additional refugees to enter the United States than would otherwise have been eligible, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling gives President Donald Trump a partial victory as the high court prepares for a key October hearing on the constitutionality of Trump's controversial executive order, which suspended travel for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days and limited refugee admissions.\n\nThe March 6 order took effect in late June following a Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings. In a ruling last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals exempted grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins of legal U.S. residents from the travel ban. The Justice Department opted not to appeal that part of the 9th Circuit decision.\n\nHowever, the 9th Circuit also ruled that Trump's refugee policy was too broad, and the court allowed entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency. The Justice Department appealed, and the full Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with the administration in a one-sentence order.\n\nNaureen Shah, Amnesty International USA's senior director of campaigns, said the refugee ban is inherently cruel. \"The Supreme Court today has dealt yet another devastating blow to vulnerable people who were on the cusp of obtaining safety for themselves and their families,\" she said. \"They continue to be subjected to unimaginable violence and fear while their lives are in limbo.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the state of Hawaii, which challenged the policy, said in a court filing that the U.S. government could still \"bar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country.\" Hawaii's lawyers added that the 9th Circuit ruling only \"protects vulnerable refugees and the American entities that have been eagerly preparing to welcome them to our shores.\"\n\nHawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said he respected the Supreme Court's decision and is preparing for the hearing there on Oct. 10.",
    " Title: Rand Paul Modulates Rhetoric on ISIS, Faces Criticism for Shift in Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a potential Republican presidential candidate, has been known for his skepticism towards military intervention overseas. In a party that is often associated with a hawkish stance, Paul has been advocating a more dovish position. His critics label this as isolationism.\n\nLast week, Paul criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's stance on Syria in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, stating that arming Islamic rebels in Syria could have led to the rise of the Islamic State. He also criticized Clinton's eagerness to intervene in Syria, stating that a regime change might have resulted in ISIS taking over.\n\nHowever, Paul has recently softened his rhetoric, stating that as president, he would seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily. He aims to avoid being perceived as soft on ISIS, but his stance is a departure from his previous anti-interventionist views.\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has also entered the debate, publishing an op-ed in the Washington Post, stating that the radical Islamic State and other global hotspots require a strong response from the U.S. military.\n\nThe tone of the political argument is shifting, with a national debate on how to deal with global hotspots causing a halt to the anti-interventionist mood in the Republican Party. The debate has led to clashes between libertarian-leaning conservatives and hawkish Republicans, such as Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nPaul has a history of expressing anti-interventionist views, as seen in a previous op-ed in the Wall Street Journal where he argued against U.S. military intervention in Iraq's civil war. In a recent op-ed, Paul criticized the U.S.'s unhinged and flailing foreign policy, stating that America cannot police or solve every problem across the globe.\n\nPaul's latest comments have sparked accusations of flip-flopping from the right. Conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin stated that Paul's stance is a result of the dangers of the outlook he previously espoused. Rubin also criticized Paul, stating that he is not a presidential candidate who has the strength of his convictions.\n\nThe issues at hand are complex, and it is possible to believe that America was too quick to make war in the Middle East and that ISIS is a threat that needs to be addressed. However, for Rand Paul, whose political brand is built on wariness of foreign entanglements, his new approach risks muddling his message.",
    " Title: Fox News Host Criticizes President Trump's Budget Signing, Expresses Doubt in Future Funding for Border Wall\n\nArticle:\n\nFox News host Jesse Watters criticized the budget signed by President Trump on Friday, expressing his disapproval of the lack of funding for the proposed border wall. In a tweet, Watters stated, \"This was a huge defeat for [@POTUS] on a signature issue... I know he wanted more money for the military, and that's incredibly important, but he sacrificed everything else to get it.\"\n\nWatters expressed concern over the limited funding allocated for the border wall, with only 1.6 billion dollars set aside, and questioned the feasibility of using the new concrete wall prototypes that President Trump recently surveyed. He also noted that the proposed funding is only for 93 miles of the 3,000-mile border, with the majority of the funding allocated for backup fencing and repairs.\n\nWatters further criticized the budget, stating, \"The border is a mess, and crying [Senator] Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) gets all the money he wants for a tunnel from New Jersey to New York and there's no border wall funding?\" He also pointed out various instances of domestic spending, such as half a billion dollars for Planned Parenthood and forty million dollars for the John F. Kennedy Center, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) budget remains at a historic high.\n\nWatters questioned President Trump's promise to never sign such a bill again, stating, \"I do not see how he's going to change the dynamic in Congress to have this never happen again. Democrats are never going to work for border wall funding and Republicans aren't going to go to the mattresses for it.\" He suggested alternative methods for funding the border wall, such as private funding from Trump's wealthy supporters or privatizing the wall.\n\nTrump initially indicated he was considering a veto of the budget on Friday, but ultimately signed it. Trump allies Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter have expressed concern that the budget could lead to Trump's impeachment after losing the House of Representatives to Democrats in the midterms.",
    " Title: Obama's Proposal for Free, High-Quality Preschool Sparks Mixed Response\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's plan to provide free, high-quality preschool across the nation is receiving a mixed response, with broad support for aiding disadvantaged children but concerns about expanding entitlements and the effectiveness of similar programs. During his State of the Union address last week, the president argued that the U.S. should begin preparing its citizens for the new, high-tech economy at the \"earliest possible age.\"\n\n\"Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road,\" Obama stated. However, less than 30 percent of 4-year-olds are enrolled in a \"high-quality\" preschool program, he said.\n\nThe president argued that most middle-class parents cannot afford several hundred dollars a week for private preschool, and that poor children, who need help the most, could be at a disadvantage \"for the rest of their lives\" without access to such education.\n\nDuring a visit to a preschool in Decatur, Ga., on Thursday, the president provided more details about the plan. The federal government would match state spending to create high-quality preschool programs for 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families. The plan also reportedly would provide extra federal money to states that expand their public preschool programs to middle-class families, offering tuition on a sliding scale.\n\nThe cost of the program remains unclear, but the president argues that investing in high-quality early education will save Americans by increasing graduation rates and reducing teen pregnancy and violent crime. Obama pointed to Georgia and Oklahoma, where, he said, studies show such programs help former students keep a job and maintain a stable family.\n\nCritics argue that the U.S. is already approximately $16 trillion in debt and point to a Department of Health and Human Services study that shows limited benefits after third grade for those enrolled in preschools under the $7 billion Head Start program.\n\nKirsten Powers, a Daily Beast columnist and contributor, stated, \"This isn't a liberal or conservative thing... I think everybody wants to help our children do better in school (but) this doesn't seem to be the thing that's doing it.\"\n\nAndrew J. Coulson, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Educational Freedom, told The New York Times that there is a big difference between touting a handful of small pre-K programs that may have had lasting and significant benefits and replicating such programs on a national level.\n\nThe Center for American Progress estimates the Obama plan would cost roughly $98 billion over 10 years. The liberal-leaning think tank also cited several studies that bolster Obama's argument about the benefits of preschool education and said families making less than $1,500 a month must spend about 53 percent of their income on care for their children 4 years old and younger.\n\n\"With all these benefits, universal preschool shouldn't be a partisan issue,\" the group said. \"And indeed, Republican-controlled states such as Oklahoma and Georgia have become national leaders in early childhood education.\"\n\nHowever, Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson told The Wall Street Journal that his state's program, which offers free pre-kindergarten to all 4-year-olds, works because it \"started locally, is funded locally and doesn't have a dime of federal money.\"",
    " Title: U.S. and Iraq Disagree on Troop Withdrawal as Tensions with Iran Escalate\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington and Baghdad find themselves at odds over the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq, as tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalate following the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has requested preparations for a U.S. troop withdrawal, in line with a vote in Iraq's parliament last week. However, the U.S. State Department stated that any U.S. delegation would not discuss the withdrawal of U.S. troops, as their presence in Iraq is considered \"appropriate.\"\n\nThe latest flare-up in the long-standing covert war between Iran and the U.S. began with the U.S. killing of Soleimani, Iran's top general, in a drone strike on Jan. 3. Iran responded on Wednesday by firing missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq. In an interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump stated that Iran had planned to attack the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and aimed to strike four U.S. embassies when Soleimani was killed.\n\nIraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the U.S.-Iranian struggle happening on Iraqi soil, stating that Iraqis stand to suffer most from the U.S.-Iranian conflict. Sistani called for no foreign powers to decide Iraq's fate and for Iraq to govern itself.\n\nIn the aftermath of the conflict, both sides have backed off from further escalation, but the region remains tense. Iran has increased its calls for U.S. forces to leave Iraq, with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stating that ending the U.S. military presence in the region is Tehran's main goal. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, stated that Washington had specific information about an imminent Iranian threat, including to U.S. embassies.\n\nIn Iraq, gunmen killed two local journalists covering protests in the southern city of Basra. Ahmed Abdulsamad, a correspondent for Dijla TV station, was killed immediately, while his camera operator succumbed to his wounds in the hospital. Essam Faraj, a demonstrator in Baghdad, stated, \"Politicians and clerics... are either with Iran, the U.S. or other countries. Our allegiance is to Iraq only, not to factions and politicians.\"\n\nThe U.S. has $35 billion of Iraq's money \"sitting in an account,\" according to Trump, and he stated that if Iraq wanted the U.S. to leave, they would have to pay for the money spent. A NATO delegation is currently in Washington to discuss the future of the Iraq mission and a plan to \"get burden-sharing right in the region.\"",
    " Title: North Korea Accuses U.S. of Gangster-like Tactics in Nuclear Disarmament Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has accused the United States of employing \"gangster-like\" tactics in its efforts to push North Korea towards nuclear disarmament following a recent round of high-level talks. The North Korean foreign ministry issued a statement, carried by the official KCNA news agency, that provided a starkly different account from that of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had stated progress was made during his two-day visit to Pyongyang.\n\nThe statement, issued anonymously, characterized the U.S. attitude at the meeting as \"extremely troubling.\" North Korea claimed the U.S. had gone against the spirit of the June summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore by putting unilateral pressure on the country to abandon its nuclear weapons.\n\nDuring the summit, Kim Jong-un had pledged to work towards denuclearization, but details on how this will be achieved remain unclear. A key aim of Pompeo during his visit was to firm up North Korea's commitment to disarmament. However, the North Korean statement accused the U.S. of adopting a \"gangster-like mindset\" and warned that its \"resolve for denuclearization... may falter.\"\n\nAt the talks, Pompeo did not meet with Kim Jong-un, but instead with Kim Yong-chol, who is seen as his right-hand man. In his assessment, Pompeo gave little away, but he did say they had discussed at length a timeline for disarmament, including the destruction of a missile engine testing facility.\n\nAfter the Singapore summit, which also saw the U.S. offer \"security guarantees\" to North Korea and promise to end its military drills with South Korea, President Trump claimed that the North no longer posed a nuclear threat. However, the president has since renewed sanctions on North Korea, while U.S. intelligence officials have stated there is evidence North Korea continues to upgrade the infrastructure for its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nA state department spokesperson said Pompeo had been \"very firm\" in focusing on denuclearization, as well as on security assurances and the return of remains of U.S. service personnel from the Korean War. As Saturday's meeting got underway, Kim Yong-chol joked that Pompeo may not have slept well during his overnight stay at a guesthouse in Pyongyang. Pompeo responded that he \"slept just fine.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the U.S. secretary of state will meet the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea in Tokyo.",
    " Title: Hong Kong Protests Enter 17th Week Amidst Ongoing Political Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing political crisis in Hong Kong, which began in June over an extradition bill, has reached its 17th week. The bill, which has since been withdrawn by Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam, has sparked widespread protests that have \"ruptured\" the trust between Hong Kong residents and the city's institutions, according to The Washington Post.\n\nDuring an unsanctioned rally on Sunday, protesters set objects on fire and smashed windows at a train station, according to Bloomberg. Hundreds of pro-China supporters turned out for a counter-protest on the same day, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds of thousands protested during a sanctioned rally commemorating the 5th anniversary of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, which also saw protesters take a stand against the Chinese government. Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowds, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the prolonged protests in Hong Kong may be a result of both Beijing's overreach and seismic changes in Hong Kong identity. \"Hong Kong\u2019s eruption into monthslong protests may have been the result not only of Beijing\u2019s overreach, but also of seismic changes in Hong Kong identity itself,\" the report states.\n\nThe 2014 Umbrella Movement took hold after Beijing submitted a proposal that would limit Hong Kong's democracy and would not allow the city to vote for its own leader, according to The Washington Post. Over the course of a few months, protestors staged sit-in street protests and carried umbrellas against pepper spray from riot police. Police fired 87 canisters of tear gas in 2014. Thus far in 2019, police have fired over 3,000 canisters and hundreds of rubber bullets in an effort to quell the protests, according to the Washington Post.\n\nLooking ahead, Hong Kong residents are threatening to stage a counter-rally during a celebration for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, according to The Washington Post. The exact details of the planned event are not yet clear.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Advances USA Freedom Act, Signaling Potential Reform of NSA's Phone-Snooping Program\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has taken a significant step towards reforming the National Security Agency's (NSA) phone-snooping program with a bipartisan majority vote for major changes to the USA PATRIOT Act on Thursday. The 25-2 vote indicates that Republicans and Democrats in the House are unlikely to support a full renewal of the PATRIOT Act, whose key data-collection powers are set to expire at the end of May.\n\nThe development deals a blow to Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has advocated for the retention of the snooping powers to ensure national security. In contrast, House Speaker John A. Boehner has expressed his support for the reform bill that passed the Judiciary Committee and is now set for a vote on the full House floor.\n\nThe legislation, known as the USA Freedom Act, aims to rewrite the PATRIOT Act's Section 215, which authorizes the government to collect records from private businesses. The bill prevents the federal government from indiscriminately collecting and storing Americans' data and increases transparency in the secret court that oversees intelligence collection.\n\nThe NSA's phone data collection program, revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden, has been a source of concern for many Americans. The program, which collects and stores five years' worth of records of the numbers, times, and durations of phone calls made within the U.S., has been defended by the NSA, which claims it only probes the records when it believes a number is associated with a terrorism investigation.\n\nThe USA Freedom Act, which was designed to end bulk collection and secret laws, has garnered bipartisan support in the past. However, an identical bill that passed the full House last year foundered in the Senate after a filibuster led by Mr. McConnell during a lame-duck session of Congress late last year.\n\nSenate Democrats generally oppose Mr. McConnell's bill, and even some Senate Republicans are divided, with hawks supporting it but civil libertarians, including presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, fiercely opposing it. Mr. McConnell has limited leverage in the debate, as the sunset of Section 215 is scheduled for June 1 without any action. He could attempt to push for a short-term extension or a lesser alternative, but his strategy remains unclear.\n\nThe issue appears to be moving away from Mr. McConnell, with the biggest threat to the House bill coming not from the hawks but from the other side, where Republicans and Democrats teamed up to try to further limit government searches under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That amendment failed, though, after some hand-wringing by lawmakers who wanted to vote for it but feared upsetting the carefully crafted consensus. The two \"No\" votes on the bill came from Rep. Ted Poe, Texas Republican, and Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses Mueller and Comey of Conflicts of Interest Ahead of Key Russia Probe Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump launched a series of tweets on Friday, alleging a number of internal \"conflicts of interest\" for Special Counsel Robert Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey, as key developments in the Russia probe and congressional testimony by Comey were set to unfold.\n\nIn a pre-dawn barrage of tweets, Trump questioned the impartiality of Mueller and Comey, who have worked together for years. He suggested that these conflicts of interest should be included in the final report of the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump accused Mueller and Comey of having a close relationship, dating back to at least 2003 when Mueller was FBI director and Comey was deputy attorney general. The president also questioned the role of a woman, who he claimed is overseeing the potential prosecution of Jerome Corsi, an ally of GOP political operative Roger Stone. This woman is likely Jeannie Rhee, a federal prosecutor on Mueller's team. Rhee is a former partner at WilmerHale, the law firm where Mueller worked prior to taking on the special counsel role.\n\nTrump also questioned the political leanings of Mueller's team, stating that the majority of prosecutors are registered Democrats or have a history of making political donations to Democratic candidates and causes. Andrew Weissmann, who has reportedly been grilling Paul Manafort, has been a subject of controversy due to past prosecutions that resulted in dismissed convictions and allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nThe president also attacked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller after assuming oversight of the Russia investigation amid former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal. Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who allegedly was a key player regarding the controversial anti-Trump dossier, has also come under scrutiny in recent months. Ohr's wife, Nellie, has worked for Fusion GPS.\n\nTrump's tweets come as Mueller faces a court-imposed Friday deadline to file potentially revealing memos outlining how Manafort allegedly broke his cooperation agreements with the government, as well as how Michael Cohen should be punished for lying to Congress in 2017 about an abandoned Trump real estate project in Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Comey is testifying behind closed doors before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, after dropping his legal challenge to congressional Republicans' subpoena earlier this week when they agreed to make public a transcript of his remarks. A key focus of questioning will be Comey's decision to write the July 2016 statement recommending against filing criminal charges in the Hillary Clinton email probe before the former secretary of state was even interviewed, as well as the apparent political bias demonstrated in a slew of text messages and leaks by top FBI officials.\n\nRepublicans are also expected to ask about the comparably favorable treatment afforded by the FBI to Clinton advisers. In October, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said he was \"shocked\" and \"dumbfounded\" when he learned that the FBI had granted immunity to former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills during its investigation into the use of Clinton's server.",
    " Title: House Democrats File Resolution to Block National Emergency Declaration, Setting Up Clash Over Presidential Powers and Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats will file a resolution on Friday aimed at blocking President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration to finance his proposed border wall, setting up a clash over funding, immigration policy, and the constitutional separation of powers. The effort, while likely to ultimately fall short, will allow Democrats to take a defiant stance against Trump, pleasing liberal voters, and may put some Republican lawmakers from swing districts and states in a difficult position.\n\nThe resolution, if passed by the Democratic-led House, will move to the Republican-controlled Senate, where there may be enough GOP defections for approval. The measure would then be sent to the president's desk for a potential veto. If the House and Senate initially approve the measure, Congress seems unlikely to muster the two-thirds majorities in each chamber needed to override a veto.\n\nThe battle is over an emergency declaration Trump has issued to access billions of dollars beyond what Congress has authorized to start erecting border barriers. Building the wall was a prominent campaign promise for Trump. Congress approved a vast spending bill last week providing nearly $1.4 billion to build 55 miles of border barriers in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, while preventing a renewed government shutdown. That measure represented a rejection of Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to construct more than 200 miles of barriers.\n\nBesides signing the bill, Trump also declared a national emergency and used other authorities to access an additional $6.6 billion for wall construction. That money would be transferred from a federal asset forfeiture fund, defense department anti-drug efforts, and a military construction fund. Federal officials have yet to identify specifically which projects would be affected.\n\nThe timing of the vote in the House is uncertain, but it seems assured due to a timeline spelled out by law. If the resolution passes in the House and Senate, it would be sent to the president's desk. If the measure is initially approved, it would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override a potential veto.\n\nThe votes could cause discomfort for other Republicans who have expressed concerns that Trump's declaration sets a precedent for future Democratic presidents to declare emergencies to address their own favored issues. The moderate Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine has already announced her support for the resolution to block the emergency declaration. With Republicans holding a 53-47 majority, three more GOP senators would need to vote with Democrats for the resolution to win initial approval.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Democrats will wait for congressional action to play out before going to the courts. Outside activists said they understood from conversations with congressional staff that Democrats were likely to file their own lawsuit, rather than simply joining other actions that 16 state attorneys general and liberal, environmental, and other organizations have commenced separately. The battle over the national emergency declaration is ongoing.",
    " Title: Facebook Prioritizes \"Trusted\" News Sources, Raises Questions About Trust and Its Definition\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook, a leading social media platform with an estimated 214 million users in the United States, has announced plans to prioritize \"trusted\" news sources in its News Feed. The decision was made following a survey of a diverse and representative sample of people across the US to gauge their familiarity with and trust in various news sources.\n\nThe relationship between Facebook and the news media is complex, with the social network serving as a significant disseminator of news produced elsewhere. Some of this news is fake, and Facebook's users are prone to spreading extreme content, including literal propaganda. In 2016, Russian agents used Facebook to disrupt the US elections, exposing 140 million people to their trolling.\n\nFacebook acknowledges the problem, with its product manager for civic engagement stating that social media could \"corrode democracy.\" The company has implemented efforts to expose untruths and deter people from sharing misinformation.\n\nThe question of how Facebook can determine what news organizations people trust is not the primary concern. Instead, the question is whether this is the right question to ask. Facebook plans to gather data through a poll, asking users about their familiarity with and trust in various news sources.\n\nIn a post on Facebook, founder Mark Zuckerberg outlined the poll, which asks users about their familiarity with and trust in news sources from a provided list. The poll's five possible answers range from \"entirely\" to \"not at all,\" easily coded as one through five or five through one.\n\nIn his 2002 book \"Trust and Trustworthiness,\" the late political scientist Russell Hardin noted that trust has messy definitions and is not widely agreed upon.

    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder Reflects on His Legacy as He Nears End of Tenure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of his resignation as Attorney General, Eric Holder made a visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, the site of his first major trial as a young public corruption prosecutor. The visit, Holder said, felt like completing a circle, having started his legal career in the same courthouse.\n\nAfter his early years as a prosecutor, Holder rose through the ranks, becoming the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., and the deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. In February 2009, he became the first African-American attorney general.\n\nHolder described the attorney general position as the best job he would ever have, one that shaped him as a lawyer and a person. During his farewell speech, Holder became emotional, reflecting on his personal and professional journey.\n\nHolder shared stories about his parents, particularly his late father, who was denied a seat in a whites-only train car while in military uniform. He also spoke about his mother, who lived long enough to see him become attorney general but grew sick and died before what Holder views as his most significant civil rights accomplishments.\n\nLooking ahead, Holder plans to continue his work on criminal justice and civil rights issues, particularly in bridging the gap between communities of color and law enforcement. He also expressed regret over the lack of progress in gun safety measures following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting.\n\nIf he stays at the Justice Department through December, Eric Holder will be the third-longest-serving attorney general in U.S. history. Holder indicated that his public life may not end with his government service.",
    " Title: GOP Presidential Race Takes Shape as Hillary Clinton Announces 2016 Bid, Romney Considered a Contender\n\nArticle:\n\nMatt Latimer, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, is a co-partner in Javelin, a literary agency and communications firm based in Alexandria, and a contributing editor at an unspecified magazine. For conservatives, the start of a presidential cycle is a time of excitement, as every Republican candidate promises to be the next Ronald Reagan. However, over time, these candidates often resemble Gerald Ford.\n\nThe 2016 presidential race is no exception, with Hillary Clinton announcing her bid for the Democratic nomination. Clinton, who lost the 2008 Democratic primary to Barack Obama, is running as the overconfident and inevitable nominee, with safe speeches and a bloated campaign staff that is already leaking against each other in the press.\n\nThe Republican field is also taking shape, with several high-profile candidates considering a run. The GOP field is expected to be so crowded that the first debate may have to be held on an aircraft carrier, with the USS Ronald Reagan as a possible venue. The candidates, who are generally of quality and worth, have impressive resumes and realistic shots at the nomination, if circumstances fall a certain way.\n\nHowever, some candidates may be running to build their brand rather than to win the presidency. These candidates may have a skeleton crew of neophytes and are likely to run only to score a few book deals and up their speaking fees.\n\nOne of the most frequently mentioned candidates is Mitt Romney, who is considered a contender by many. Romney, who lost the 2012 presidential election to Obama, is reportedly considering a run again. However, Romney, who is cautious and practical, may find the risks of running to be greater than the potential reward.\n\nThere is no clear frontrunner in the GOP race, and many in the D.C. pundit class are preparing to take apart the candidates bit by bit. In 1980, the same D.C. insiders thought anybody but Ronald Reagan would be the GOP nominee, but Reagan won anyway. This year, the line is that Jeb Bush has the GOP nomination for the taking, but many outside the D.C. bubble find this idea vaguely depressing, as it suggests a possible Bush-Clinton rematch of the 1992 election.",
    " Title: Pelosi Suggests Open Discussion on Mueller Indicting President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, likely to be the next Speaker of the House, stated in an interview on Thursday that it is an \"open discussion\" on whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller could seek an indictment of President Donald Trump. In an interview on NBC's \"Today,\" Pelosi said, \"I think that that is an open discussion.\"\n\nWhen asked if Mueller \"should honor and observe the [Department of Justice] guidance that states a sitting president can not be indicted,\" Pelosi responded, \"I do not think that that is conclusive. No, I do not.\"\n\nPelosi later added that lawmakers should focus on getting results for the American people and see what Mueller reports. She stated, \"Everything indicates that a president can be indicted after he is no longer president of the U.S.\"\n\nThe comments come as Mueller's probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow continues into 2019. In December, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in prison for a series of crimes he committed while working as Trump's personal attorney.\n\nThe sentence occurred after Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges, including campaign finance violations stemming from payments to keep two women quiet after they say they had affairs with Trump more than a decade ago. Prior to Cohen's sentencing, federal prosecutors in New York said in a memo that Trump directed Cohen to make the illegal payments to the women, marking the first time prosecutors made those accusations against the president.\n\nThe allegations have led to scrutiny about the Justice Department guidelines around indicting a sitting president. Sen. Christopher Coons (D-Del.) said last month that the evidence presented against Cohen \"might well form the basis for an indictment after the president leaves office.\"\n\nIn a poll released last month, a majority of Americans said they think that a sitting president should be subject to indictment. Seventy-one percent of respondents, including 49 percent of Republicans, said sitting presidents should be subject to indictment, while 21 percent said they should not.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Tie Results in Stalemate on Obama's Immigration Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has reached a 4-4 decision on two controversial immigration policies proposed by President Barack Obama, leaving in place a lower court ruling that blocks the implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nThe tied vote prevents the administration from implementing a program that would allow undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to remain in the United States for three years and apply for work permits. It also halts the administration's efforts to expand the DACA program, which was issued in 2012.\n\nThis is the most prominent Supreme Court case to stall in a 4-4 tie, and it increases the stakes for this fall's presidential election. The vacancy on the court, created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, has led to a standoff between the White House and Senate Republicans, who have refused to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland.\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court's decision, President Obama criticized the lack of a decision by the eight-justice court, stating, \"The fact the Supreme Court wasn\u2019t able to issue a decision today doesn\u2019t just set the system back even further, it takes us further back from the country we want to be.\"\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) blasted the GOP Senate majority for failing to consider Garland, stating, \"This 4-4 decision is clear evidence we need nine justices on the court.\"\n\nPresumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has pledged to place tough new restrictions on illegal immigration, including the construction of a wall along the U.S.'s southern border. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) stated, \"The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling makes the president\u2019s executive action on immigration null and void.\"\n\nThursday's action does not affect the original DACA decision, which allows certain children who entered or stayed in the United States illegally to remain in the country and apply for work permits. The lawsuit filed by the 26 states challenging the administration's immigration policies is still working its way through the court system.\n\nWhen President Obama took action to expand his immigration programs, it was part of a last-ditch effort to take action after Congress failed to pass a sweeping overhaul of the nation's immigration system. Immigrant rights activists have criticized Obama as the \"deporter in chief\" for ramping up the pace of deportations during his first term. Since then, he has taken steps to narrow the focus of immigration enforcement. His executive actions were seen as a centerpiece of his push to reverse that trend.",
    " Title: State Department Designates Groups Involved in 2012 Benghazi Attack as Terrorist Organizations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of State, on Friday, designated Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, Ansar al-Sharia in Darnah, and Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia as terrorist organizations, citing their involvement in the 2012 attack on the U.S. Special Mission and Annex in Benghazi, Libya. The department also labeled Sufian bin Qumu, head of the Darnah branch, and Ahmed Abu Khattalah, head of the Benghazi branch, as terrorists.\n\nThe State Department's announcement comes after initial claims that the attack was spontaneous, related to protests over an anti-Islam film that were raging elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East. However, the department has since backed off that explanation, though has not ruled out the film as having played some role.\n\nThe State Department specifically discussed allegations against the Ansar al-Sharia branches, stating that they have been involved in terrorist attacks against civilian targets, frequent assassinations, and attempted assassinations of security officials and political actors in eastern Libya. The department also cited the September 11, 2012 attacks against the U.S. Special Mission and Annex in Benghazi, Libya, and noted that members of both organizations continue to pose a threat to U.S. interests in Libya.\n\nSufian bin Qumu, who was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, has historic ties to the Al Qaeda network, including training at Usama bin Laden's Torkham camp. Ahmed Abu Khattalah, in October 2012, told Fox News that while he was at the U.S. consulate that night, he was not responsible for the attack, claiming he was helping Libyan security workers defending the compound.\n\nThe new terror designation bars anyone from providing or trying to provide \"material support or resources\" to those organizations and individuals, and freezes any assets they have in the U.S. The State Department also updated its Rewards for Justice website to include a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of anyone involved in the Benghazi attack. The department had faced criticism for not including that reward on the website, though officials claimed reward offers had nevertheless been made.\n\nFour Americans died in the 2012 attack, and so far, nobody has been brought to justice in connection with the killings. The U.S. government is committed to taking all appropriate actions against the organizations and individuals responsible for the attacks against the U.S. diplomatic facilities in Libya and Tunisia, according to the State Department.",

Napolitano explained that the Chinese often invest in entities associated with individuals they believe can provide them a foothold in American society.\n\n The analysis follows Hunter Biden's announcement that he is stepping down from the board of a Chinese company and declaring he will not engage in any foreign work if his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president in 2020.\n\n In an interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden admitted that his involvement with foreign companies provided a platform for critics to attack him over alleged conflicts of interest. He stated, \"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake.\"\n\n Joe Biden, who will debate other Democratic presidential candidates Tuesday evening, has not conducted any sit-down interviews with national broadcast media outlets since President Trump began attacking the Bidens last month.\n\n Trump and Republicans have accused Hunter Biden of profiting off his father's office and claim the former vice president is corrupt. However, Joe Biden has denied acting with his son's interests in mind. There is no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\n House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump last month following revelations that he pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens.",
    " Title: Fox News' Role in U.S. Immigration Reform Debate Remains Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over a potential path to citizenship for the United States' 11 million undocumented immigrants, Fox News Channel is positioned to play a significant role. The question is whether it will assume a more neutral role or fan the flames of opposition to a comprehensive reform plan.\n\nRupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp., Fox's parent company, is a wild card factor in determining Fox News' stance. Murdoch, an Australian-born U.S. citizen, has become an outspoken advocate for immigration reform and the mass legalization of undocumented immigrants, partnering with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in this cause. Whether Murdoch's personal views will influence the network's coverage remains uncertain.\n\nIra Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform and a frequent Fox News guest, opposes the widespread legalization proposed by President Obama and a bipartisan group of U.S. senators. Mehlman believes Fox News could be a crucial ally in the battle for public opinion on immigration, crediting the network with helping to derail a similar legislative push in 2006 and 2007.\n\nHowever, 2013 is shaping up to be a different game, with Fox News potentially emerging as a potential boon for immigrant advocates. Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Charles Krauthammer, prominent Fox hosts and commentators, have expressed support for immigration reform, suggesting the network could be a valuable forum to court moderates.\n\nMurdoch's personal views and their impact on Fox News' coverage remain unclear. During a 2010 hearing on Capitol Hill, Murdoch advocated for a \"full path to legalization\" for the millions living and working in the shadows. He has since been vocal about his support for immigration reform on Twitter.\n\nFox News' primetime viewership has been on the decline in recent months, but it remains a highly-profitable network with the largest news audience on cable. Its median prime-time viewership was 1.9 million in 2011, well ahead of MSNBC (773,000) and CNN (654,000), according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nMany advocates caution against overstating the influence of Fox News, insisting the network will not play a decisive role in the immigration debate one way or the other. Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, believes the diversity and bipartisanship of advocates for a reform plan will override any single, particular influence.\n\nMurdoch has tried to downplay his network's influence on political debate over immigration, stating, \"We are home to all views on Fox. We do not censor that or take any particular line at all. We are not anti-immigrant on Fox News.\" The outcome of the immigration reform debate remains uncertain, with Fox News' role in the debate yet to be determined.",
    " Title: Florida ICUs Reach Capacity as Coronavirus Cases Surge\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida hospitals have reported that their intensive-care units (ICUs) are at capacity or dangerously low on beds due to the surge in coronavirus cases. At least 56 Florida ICUs have run out of beds for coronavirus patients, and 35 more have reported bed availability dropping to 10 percent or lower.\n\nThe latest data comes as Florida recorded over 7,300 new coronavirus cases, 380 new hospitalizations, and 63 more deaths from the infection on Tuesday. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stated on Tuesday that the death rate in his state has begun to taper off, noting that most of the new cases are younger patients.\n\nSeveral other states, including Georgia and California, have also seen a surge in coronavirus cases after reopening large swaths of their economies. Georgia passed 100,000 positive coronavirus cases on Tuesday, making it the ninth state to reach that number. California recorded a record daily increase of over 10,200 new coronavirus cases and a record 6,000 hospitalized patients on the same day. Some Texas counties have also warned that their hospital ICUs will run out of beds over the next two weeks.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser for the Trump administration's coronavirus task force, noted on Tuesday that the death rate from the virus has decreased but warned against \"false complacency\" as the pathogen continues to spread.\n\n\"It's a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,\" Fauci said. \"There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into false complacency.\"\n\n\"The death rate is lower, I admit that.

    " Title: Judge Rules Trump Exceeded Authority in Reversing Offshore Drilling Bans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a ruling on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason overturned President Trump's executive order that reversed bans on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean. The ruling restores the Obama-era restrictions that were a significant part of his environmental legacy.\n\nPresidents have the power under a federal law to remove certain lands from development, but they cannot revoke those removals, according to Gleason. The judge's decision states that the wording of President Obama's 2015 and 2016 withdrawals indicates that he intended them to extend indefinitely and be revocable only by an act of Congress.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, a defendant in the case, disagreed with the ruling. In a statement, the organization argued that developing offshore resources could provide billions in government revenue, create thousands of jobs, and strengthen national security.\n\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, welcomed the ruling, stating that it \"shows that the president can not just trample on the Constitution to do the bidding of his cronies in the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our oceans, wildlife, and climate.\" Earthjustice represented numerous environmental groups that sued the Trump administration over the April 2017 executive order reversing the drilling bans.\n\nThe case centered around the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Acting Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Wood argued during a hearing before Gleason in November that environmental groups were misinterpreting the intent of the law written in 1953. He stated that the law is meant to be flexible and sensible and not intended to bind one president with decisions made by another when determining offshore stewardship as needs and realities change over time.\n\nIn 2015, Obama halted exploration in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the Hanna Shoal, an important area for walrus. In late 2016, he withdrew most other potential Arctic Ocean lease areas, covering about 98 percent of the Arctic outer continental shelf. The bans were intended to protect polar bears, walruses, ice seals, and Alaska Native villages that depend on the animals.\n\nIn the Atlantic, Obama banned exploration in 5,937 square miles (15,377 square kilometers) of underwater canyon complexes, citing their importance for marine mammals, deep-water corals, valuable fish populations, and migratory whales.",
    " Title: Merkel's White House Visit Focuses on Ukraine Crisis, Amidst Ongoing NSA Spying Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House on Friday will be marked by the ongoing tension from last year's revelations of US eavesdropping on her cellphone, but the crisis in Ukraine is expected to dominate the agenda. Facing the gravest challenge to stability in Europe since the cold war, Merkel and President Obama will be looking to each other for leadership in addressing the Ukraine storm.\n\nMerkel, the Western leader with the closest personal relationship with Putin and whose country has the strongest economic ties to Russia, is expected to argue for a careful \"step-by-step\" approach to Russian aggression. She has been deeply disappointed by Putin's annexation of Crimea and the campaign of destabilization he is carrying out in eastern Ukraine, and now believes a tough Western response is in order.\n\nAt the same time, Merkel is likely to encourage Obama to continue with his approach of coordinating with Europe and prioritizing transatlantic unity over unilateral action. This, despite the domestic criticism Merkel knows Obama faces for not moving faster.\n\n\"Merkel's response to the crisis has been a little bit tougher than some might have expected,\" says Christopher Chivvis, a specialist in European and Eurasian security at RAND Corp. in Arlington, Va. \"It's also true, he adds, that because of Germany's leadership role in Europe and its dominant role in relations with Russia, 'what she says has a really big impact in the region.'\"\n\nAs a result of Merkel's somewhat surprising firmness and the influential role she plays, Obama is expected to try to enlist Germany to go farther and do more. \"I would expect the president will try to lean in a little bit on Ukraine,\" he says.\n\nObama has refrained from imposing sanctions on entire sectors of the Russian economy in part because of European reluctance to go that route. But the president is expected to try to pin down with Merkel what additional Russian actions in Ukraine would trigger tougher measures from the Europeans, including broader sectoral sanctions, US officials say.\n\nOn the Ukraine file, the two leaders will have more than just the issue of sanctions on Russia to keep them busy. Another priority item will be how to help ensure that the national elections Ukraine has scheduled for May 25 go off without major hitches (many regional experts believe Russia is doing everything it can to undermine the vote) and result in a legitimate and authoritative national government.\n\nUkraine's economic survival will also be on the agenda. In addition to her White House visit, Merkel will also meet with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde to discuss what financial and economic help Ukraine will need to get back on its feet.\n\nMerkel is also scheduled to address the US Chamber of Commerce Friday afternoon, focusing on the transatlantic free trade and investment agreement that the US and European Union are hoping to conclude next year. She was planning to dine with a group of US senators upon her arrival in Washington Thursday evening.\n\nYet even as Ukraine receives top billing in Merkel's visit, the outrage she \u2013 and indeed much of Germany \u2013 felt upon learning last year of NSA spying on German leaders, including Merkel, will not be far below the surface.\n\nWhen Obama invited Merkel to Washington earlier this year, she said pointedly that the process of reestablishing trust would take \"more than one trip.\" Germany has pressed for a \"no-spy\" accord with the US like the one the US has with Britain and a few other English-speaking allies, but the US has made it clear it is not prepared to take that step, and Merkel is not expected to insist on that point.\n\nThis willingness to downplay an important issue that risks getting in the way of addressing another will put Merkel's pragmatism on full display. It also provides a stark contrast with the response of another world leader who found her country embroiled in the NSA spying controversy.\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff had been invited for what would have been the only state visit to the Obama White House last year. But with Brazilians still furious over revelations of US spying in their country, Ms. Rousseff called off the visit. US-Brazilian relations have not recovered since.\n\nMerkel also faces heightened anti-American sentiments at home, German experts note. But she also supports a strong transatlantic partnership, these experts emphasize, and she represents a Germany that sees a continuing US leadership role in Europe as all the more important in the era of an aggressive and even expansionist Russia.\n\n\"The Germans want to stay close to the US,\" says Charles Ries, international vice president and expert in European Affairs at RAND. \"They don't want the story [from Merkel's visit] to be one of divergence.\"\n\nBut Ambassador Ries, who just returned to Washington from Europe, says German leaders and many of their European colleagues want the US to consult with them and take their concerns into consideration even as it retains an active role in Europe.\n\n\"Often they grumble if we don't set out a clear [path]... but they can also grumble if we do,\" says Ries. \"What they really don't like is when the US seems to be not acting.\"\n\nThat ambivalence presents \"a leadership challenge for the US,\" he says. Some public expression of understanding from Obama about Germany's spying concerns might be enough to deliver the picture of firm accord on Ukraine the White House wants. \"If [Merkel] gets that,\" Ries says, \"it's likely the US 'can get an outcome from the White House visit that [projects] strong alliance unity and resolve.'\"",
    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder's Policies and Charter Schools: A Contentious Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder's policies towards charter schools and school discipline have been a contentious issue, with critics accusing him of prioritizing the interests of teachers unions over the education of poor and minority children. One of the notable instances was Holder's attempt to suppress the spread of charter schools in Louisiana, and his nationwide threats of legal action against schools that discipline more black students than he deems appropriate.\n\nCharter schools, often criticized by teachers unions and the educational establishment, seem to be particularly targeted when they succeed in educating minority children, a demographic that the educational establishment often claims cannot be educated effectively. The success of these schools often lies in their ability to hire non-unionized teachers and avoid adhering to the dogmas prevalent in the educational establishment.\n\nLast year, there was an attempt to shut down the American Indian Model Schools in Oakland, California, schools that were ranked among the top in the nation, with top test scores in their district and the fourth-highest scores in the entire state of California. The reason given was financial irregularities alleged against the former head of these schools. However, a court order prevented this planned vindictive closing of this highly successful charter school with a predominantly minority student body.\n\nHolder's threats of legal action against schools where minority students are disciplined more often than he wants are a more sweeping and damaging blow to the education of poor and minority students across the country. The education of many ghetto schools is often hindered by disruptive students whose antics, threats, and violence can make education virtually impossible. If only 10% of the students are this way, it sacrifices the education of the other 90%.\n\nThe idea that Holder, or anyone else, can determine how many disciplinary actions against individual students are warranted or unwarranted in schools across the country would be laughable if it were not so tragic. Relying on racial statistics tells you nothing, unless one believes that black male students can not possibly be more disruptive than Asian female students, or that students in crime-ridden neighborhoods can not possibly require disciplinary actions more often than children in the most staid, middle-class neighborhoods.\n\nCritics argue that Holder's policies are politically motivated, with the intention of promoting a sense of grievance from charges of racial discrimination to energize the black vote and secure Democratic support, especially in the wake of Obama administration scandals and fiascoes. Holder's other major racial crusade - against requiring identification for voting - is similarly criticized as a political game, orchestrated to promote fears and hysteria.\n\nMichael J. W. Malbin, a senior fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, has been critical of Holder's policies, stating that sacrificing the education of children, especially those for whom education may be their only ticket out of poverty, is a new low.",
    " Title: BuzzFeed Publishes Unverified Allegations Against Trump: A Look at the Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and debate within the journalism community, online news outlet BuzzFeed published an unverified dossier containing allegations against President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday. The dossier, which was also referenced in a report by CNN, includes claims of Russian efforts to compromise Trump and salacious personal details.\n\nThe decision by BuzzFeed to publish the dossier, while stating \"there is serious reason to doubt the allegations,\" has been met with criticism from Trump, his team, and other media outlets. Trump called BuzzFeed \"a failing piece of garbage\" that will \"suffer the consequences\" of its actions, while Vice President-elect Mike Pence blamed the situation on \"media bias.\"\n\nCNN, which initially reported on the briefing of the allegations to President Obama and Trump, chose not to detail the specific claims due to their unverified nature. However, by referencing the fact that Trump was briefed about a two-page synopsis, CNN put the allegations in the public sphere, raising doubts about whether Trump had been \"compromised\" in some way.\n\nThe furor began when CNN anchor Jake Tapper reported that the nation's top intelligence officials had provided information about Russian efforts to compromise Trump to both Obama and Trump last week. BuzzFeed, in turn, published the entire dossier, which can be found elsewhere online.\n\nThe situation has put the rest of the media in an uncomfortable position, as they report on an unproven story while trying to avoid the details. Some websites have been happy to repeat the rumors, but others, such as The New York Times, have chosen not to publish the allegations due to a lack of corroboration.\n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, stated, \"We, like others, investigated the allegations and haven't corroborated them, and we felt we're not in the business of publishing things we can't stand by.\"\n\nBuzzFeed defends its decision to publish the dossier, claiming it is being \"transparent\" with its readers. However, the transparency has allowed the public to witness what some consider to be shoddy journalism, as BuzzFeed is also known for its pop culture-focused content, including articles such as \"How Bitchy Is Your Resting Face?\" and \"Would you get rid of your phone just to have an orgasm?\"\n\nThe controversy has sparked a larger discussion about the role of journalism in 2017, with some arguing that BuzzFeed's decision to publish the unverified dossier is a perversion of journalistic practices, while others argue that it is important to report on all information, even if it is unverified. The situation remains a contentious issue within the journalism community.",
    " Title: Former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert Indicted for Trying to Evade Currency Reporting Rules and Lying to the FBI\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal grand jury has indicted former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert on charges of trying to circumvent currency reporting rules and lying to the FBI regarding payments he was making for past \"misconduct.\" The indictment does not describe the nature of the misconduct, but it paints a picture of a cover-up, stating that Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million to an individual identified as \"Individual A\" to conceal his past behavior.\n\nBeginning in 2010, Hastert, 73, and Individual A would meet every six weeks, with Hastert providing $50,000 during each meeting. Federal investigators became involved when Hastert, after being questioned by his bank about large withdrawals, began making smaller withdrawals of less than $10,000, then bundling them to evade reporting requirements.\n\nThe indictment, handed up from a grand jury in Chicago, alleges that Hastert lied to FBI investigators in December about the withdrawals, stating he was keeping the cash. From 2010 to 2014, Hastert withdrew approximately $1.7 million in cash from various bank accounts and provided it to Individual A. Beginning in July 2012, Hastert started structuring his cash withdrawals in increments of less than $10,000 to evade Currency Transaction Reports, according to the U.S. Attorney's office.\n\nThe case was pursued by the FBI and the IRS' criminal investigation division. Hastert served two decades in the House and was speaker from 1999 through 2007, notching the longest tenure of any Republican speaker in history. He stepped down after overseeing a disastrous election for House Republicans in 2006, and led the lobbying arm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP, a Washington law firm, until his resignation on Thursday.\n\nHastert did not respond to an email request for comment Thursday evening. He has a public policy center named for him at Wheaton College in Illinois, and served on several corporate boards. CME Group announced Thursday that he had stepped down from its board, according to news reports.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Hastert has turned over about $1.7 million of the $3.5 million he had agreed to pay to Individual A. Of that, $952,000 was taken out in increments of less than $10,000, which investigators said was done in violation of the currency law.\n\nWhen the FBI questioned Hastert, they asked if he was keeping the money because he didn't feel safe with it in the banks. \"Yeah \u2026 I kept the cash. That's what I'm doing,\" he told them, according to the indictment.\n\nHastert was a high school teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville, Illinois, from 1967 to 1981, and the indictment states that Individual A is a resident of the same town and \"has known defendant John Dennis Hastert most of Individual A's life.\" The indictment also mentions that the two met repeatedly in 2010, and during one of those meetings, they discussed past misconduct by Hastert against Individual A that had occurred years earlier.\n\nDuring his time as House speaker, Hastert served with former Rep. Tom DeLay, who had to step down after he was indicted on charges of conspiring to launder campaign contributions. DeLay was found guilty by a jury, but an appeals court later ruled the evidence was insufficient and dismissed the case.",
    " Title: Investigation of Race-Based Discrimination in College Admissions Initiated by Department of Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly investigating potential race-based discrimination in college and university admissions, according to a document obtained by The New York Times. The DOJ is allegedly seeking lawyers interested in \"investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions.\"\n\nThe DOJ's actions have been met with various interpretations, with The New York Times describing the intent as \"redirecting resources\" to protect \"white applicants.\" However, the DOJ's actions could be seen as enforcing the law, as the investigation aims to address allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants in higher education institutions.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Asian-American groups filed complaints against several elite American colleges, presenting evidence of race-based discrimination in college admissions. For example, they alleged that Asian Americans have the \"lowest acceptance rate for each SAT test-score bracket.\" To gain admission to college, Asian-American students had to score 140 points higher than white students, 270 points higher than Hispanic students, and 450 points higher than black students.\n\nThe complaints also presented strong evidence of prohibited quotas, as the college-admission rate for Asian-American students stagnated as the Asian-American population expanded, similar to anti-Semitic administrators' use of caps on Jewish students in the past.\n\nThe complaints rightly assail the damage caused by the quotas and the obvious and extreme higher standards applied to Asian-American students. The discriminatory practices by Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, and other Ivy League colleges have caused stress, mental health issues, pressure to study more, lack of trust in American institutions, self-identification crises, and fortification of racial barriers for students in the Asian-American community.\n\nThe DOJ's investigation aims to address these issues and enforce the law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in federally funded educational institutions, as stated in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which establishes that no state can deny any person within its jurisdiction the \"equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nDecades of leftist judicial and regulatory activism have reversed the meanings of these protections, with the Supreme Court repeatedly reaffirming that the 14th Amendment permits the use of race in admissions for the sake of advancing the \"compelling state interest\" of a properly diverse student body. However, the exceptions are supposed to be relatively narrow, and colleges are supposed to reject formulas and quotas. The admissions process is supposed to be \"holistic,\" with race merely one of many factors considered. In practice, quotas exist, and race isn't just one factor in admissions\u2014time and again, it's the most important factor.",
    " Title: Mueller's Team Denies Trap-Setting in Flynn Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a recent court filing, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has denied any suggestion that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was tricked by FBI agents during his interview regarding his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The interview took place at the White House on January 24, 2017, just days after President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nAccording to the new court documents, the interview was voluntary and lacked any indicia of coercion. This response comes after Flynn's attorneys earlier this week suggested that the FBI may have deceived the former national security advisor by not warning him about the criminal consequences for lying to agents during the interview.\n\nMueller's prosecutors argue that a sitting national security advisor, former head of an intelligence agency, retired lieutenant general, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces should be aware of the consequences of lying to federal agents. They also asserted that the court should reject Flynn's attempt to minimize the seriousness of his false statements to the FBI.\n\nThe new filings are made in advance of Flynn's December 18 sentencing. Prosecutors have recommended no prison time for the former Trump administration official who has provided substantial cooperation in the ongoing Russia investigation. Flynn's attorneys have also asked for leniency and no prison time for their client.\n\nBefore the interview, FBI officials had decided that they would not warn Flynn about the potential criminal jeopardy he faced for making false statements. The interview was arranged by then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was subsequently fired for unauthorized disclosures to reporters. The primary interviewing agent was Peter Strzok, a senior counterintelligence official who was later dismissed for making disparaging comments about candidate Donald Trump in text messages exchanged with an FBI lawyer who was Strzok's girlfriend.\n\nDespite the questions raised about FBI tactics, prosecutors continued to support leniency for the former administration officer, who will be the first former White House official to be sentenced in Mueller's continuing inquiry. Last week, Mueller's prosecutors provided an account of Flynn's extensive cooperation, citing the former three-star general's \"substantial\" assistance to the Russia inquiry and at least two other undisclosed investigations in recommending that he serve no prison time.\n\nFlynn, according to prosecutors, has met with investigators 19 times since he pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak during the run-up to Trump's inauguration. Prosecutors have lauded Flynn's assistance, claiming that his early guilty plea and decision to cooperate \"likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming with the (special counsel\u2019s office) and cooperate.\"\n\nFlynn, who memorably called for the jailing of Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Republican convention, discussed U.S. sanctions with Kislyak on Trump's behalf during the presidential transition, and members of the president's inner circle were aware of, and in some cases directing, his efforts, according to the plea. Flynn had urged Kislyak not to respond to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to Russian election interference. Flynn's FBI interview came just weeks before he was forced to resign in February 2017. The White House said he was fired for misleading Pence and other senior officials about the content of his conversations with Kislyak. As part of his plea, Flynn also admitted to lying about Turkish lobbying and research work. He belatedly registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work weeks after he left the White House.",
    " Title: Key Lawmakers Express Concern Over Obama Administration's Plan to Send F-16 Fighter Jets to Egypt\n\nArticle:\n\nKey lawmakers in the United States have expressed concerns about the Obama administration's plan to send 20 F-16 fighter jets to Egypt, as the country's new President Mohamed Morsi's allegiances and grip on power remain uncertain. The U.S. is providing the planes under a foreign aid deal signed in 2010, during the tenure of Morsi's U.S.-friendly predecessor, Hosni Mubarak.\n\nThe first four jets are set to be delivered beginning January 22, according to a source at the naval air base in Fort Worth, where the planes have been undergoing testing. The $213 million gift, however, is raising questions on Capitol Hill, as Morsi is under fire for attempting to seize dictatorial powers and allegedly siccing thugs and rapists on protesters.\n\nFlorida Rep. Vern Buchanan, who recently called for ending foreign aid to Egypt altogether, said the Muslim Brotherhood-backed Morsi government has been sending increasingly troubling signals to Washington, and giving it state-of-the-art fighter jets is a dangerous idea.\n\n\"American tax dollars must not be used to aid and abet any dictatorial regime that stands with terrorists,\" Buchanan said.\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told FoxNews.com that Egypt is a wild card under Morsi.\n\n\"At this point, we do not know where Egypt is headed,\" Thornberry said. \"We should be cautious about driving them away, but we should also be cautious about the arms we provide.\"\n\nLast week, vigilante supporters of Morsi captured dozens of protesters, detaining and beating them before handing them over to police, according to human rights advocates. Morsi-backed groups have also been accused of using rape to intimidate female protesters who have gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to protest a Sharia-based constitution and Morsi's neutering of the nation's legal system.\n\nThe U.S. government ordered and paid for the fighter jets for Egypt's military back in 2010. However, since Mubarak's ouster, the democratically elected Morsi has sent mixed signals about whether he wants an alliance with Washington, even meeting with leaders in Iran earlier this year.\n\n\"The Morsi-led Muslim Brotherhood government has not proven to be a partner for democracy as they had promised, given the recent attempted power grab,\" a senior Republican congressional aide told FoxNews.com.\n\nRep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, recently criticized U.S. military aid to Egypt:\n\n\"The Obama administration wants to simply throw money at an Egyptian government that the president can not even clearly state is an ally of the United States,\" Rep. Ros-Lehtinen said.\n\nThe package had to be approved by lawmakers in Washington. While the basic F-16 has been a military workhorse for top air forces for more than 25 years, the cockpit electronics are constantly updated, and the models Egypt is getting are the best defense contractor Lockheed Martin makes.\n\n\"This is a great day for Lockheed Martin and a testament to the enduring partnership and commitment we have made to the government of Egypt,\" said John Larson, vice president, Lockheed Martin F-16 programs. \"We remain committed to providing our customer with a proven, advanced 4th Generation multirole fighter.\"\n\n\"In an air combat role, the F-16's maneuverability and combat radius exceed that of all potential threat fighter aircraft,\" the U.S. Air Force description of the plane reads.\n\n\"The F-16 can fly more than 500 miles, deliver its weapons with superior accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point. An all-weather capability allows it to accurately deliver ordnance during non-visual bombing conditions,\" the U.S. Air Force description continues.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. and Egypt have an important alliance that is furthered by the transfer.\n\n\"The U.S.-Egypt defense relationship has served as the cornerstone of our broader strategic partnership for over thirty years,\" said Lt. Col. Wesley Miller. \"The delivery of the first set of F-16s in January 2013 reflects the U.S. commitment to supporting the Egyptian military's modernization efforts. Egyptian acquisition of F-16s will increase our militaries' interoperability, and enhance Egypt's capacity to contribute to regional mission sets.\"\n\nHowever, Malou Innocent, a foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute, warned that Egypt's murky intentions could lead to the prospect of U.S. ally Israel facing an air assault from even more U.S.-made planes.\n\n\"Should an overreaction [by Egypt] spiral into a broader conflict between Egypt and Israel, such a scenario would put U.S. officials in an embarrassing position of having supplied massive amounts of military hardware\u2026 to both belligerents,\" Innocent said. \"Given Washington's fiscal woes, American taxpayers should no longer be Egypt\u2019s major arms supplier.\"",
    " Title: Former BBC Director General Mark Thompson Clarifies Knowledge of Jimmy Savile Abuse Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe former Director General of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Mark Thompson, has attempted to clarify his knowledge of a journalistic investigation into sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile, a late children's TV presenter. The investigation, which was initially dropped in late 2011, has been a subject of controversy in recent weeks.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Thompson stated, \"I was not notified or briefed about the 'Newsnight' investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation.\" He also claimed, \"During my time as Director General of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile.\"\n\nHowever, in a report published in the New York Times on Tuesday, Thompson was quoted as saying that a BBC reporter informed him about the investigation at a party in December.\n\nIn a letter to British MP Rob Wilson, Thompson offered an explanation to reconcile his two statements. He explained that he learned of the investigation but not its details and was satisfied when he inquired to his senior management and was told that it had been dropped for journalistic reasons.\n\nThompson added that he did not question the decision to drop the investigation because such decisions are common. He also expressed his shock and concern over the sexual abuse allegations against Savile.\n\nThe controversy has raised questions about who knew what and when about the alleged abuse of young teenage girls, and it threatens lasting damage to the reputation of the UK's public broadcaster. The Metropolitan Police in London launched a criminal investigation into claims of child sexual abuse by Savile and others last week.\n\nThe BBC said on Monday that the editor of 'Newsnight' was \"stepping aside\" over questions about why his show never broadcast its investigation into Savile. The furor has shocked a generation in Britain who grew up watching Savile, one of the most recognizable figures in British showbiz from the 1960s to the 1980s, or listening to his radio shows.\n\nThe controversy has also prompted a wider examination of an apparent culture of sexism at the BBC in past decades that may have fed into abusive behavior. The allegations against the famous Savile are a reminder of how little the public really knows about celebrities, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University.\n\n\"It's another one of these instances that shows us whenever there's someplace we think we won't see scandal, eventually, we end up seeing it,\" he said. The scandal brings the venerable BBC into question and feeds the state of cynicism that the public feels for media institutions, he added.",
    " Title: Colin Kaepernick Announces Memoir Release and New Publishing Company Focused on Diversity\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who gained political prominence for his protests against police brutality and social injustice during NFL games, has given an interview to USA Today and announced the release of a memoir under his own publishing company, Kaepernick Publishing. The memoir, yet to be titled, will delve into the life experiences that led him to protest during his NFL career.\n\nIn the interview, Kaepernick explained, \"I've had a lot of questions surrounding what got me to the point of protesting. Which led me to wanting to share that story and give insight.\" He further elaborated on his decision to protest, stating, \"Why did I do it? Why did I do it at that moment? Why wasn't it earlier in my career?\"\n\nKaepernick Publishing, established in 2019, will focus on promoting writers of color and giving power to black and brown voices globally. The company aims to offer unprecedented ownership options to collaborators and bring greater diversity and representation to literature and spoken word.\n\nKaepernick's activism off the field includes the creation of the Know Your Rights Campaign, which hosts educational camps, and an endorsement contract with Nike in 2018. Despite being unsigned by any NFL team since 2017, Kaepernick has sued the NFL for collusion and reached a settlement for less than $10 million in February 2019.\n\nKaepernick expressed his readiness to return to the football field, stating, \"My desire to play football is still there. I'm ready to go, I'm ready for a phone call, tryout, workout at any point in time.\" He added, \"I'm still waiting on the owners and their partners to stop running from this situation. So I hope I get a call this offseason.\"\n\nThe NFL attempted to organize a workout for Kaepernick in 2019, but the event fell apart due to last-minute changes and Kaepernick's refusal to sign a liability waiver.",
    " Title: Louisville Police Department Fires Officer Involved in Breonna Taylor Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Louisville Metro Police Department has terminated the employment of Officer Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in the March shooting of 26-year-old emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor. In a letter to Hankison, tweeted by the department, Louisville police chief called his conduct \"a shock to the conscience.\"\n\nTaylor was fatally shot on March 13, when officers entered her home seeking illegal drugs. Officials claimed the officers knocked on the door and announced themselves, and only started shooting after they were \"immediately met by gunfire\" from Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. However, Taylor's family stated in a lawsuit that the officers did not identify themselves, and that Walker, a licensed gun owner, thought someone was trying to break in.\n\nThe letter states that Hankison was found to have violated two standard operating procedures: obedience to rules and regulations and use of deadly force. Hankison violated the first procedure when he \"wantonly and blindly fired ten (10) rounds\" into Taylor's apartment, Chief of Police Robert Schroeder wrote in the letter, adding, \"These rounds created a substantial danger of death and serious injury to Breonna Taylor and the three occupants of the apartment next to Ms. Taylor's.\"\n\nSchroeder said Hankison also violated the department's use of force procedure when he fired the rounds \"without supporting facts that your deadly force was directed at a person against whom posed an immediate threat of danger or serious injury to yourself or others.\"\n\n\"In fact, the ten (10) rounds you fired were into a patio door and window which were covered with material that completely prevented you from verifying any person as an immediate threat or more importantly any innocent persons present,\" he added.\n\nSchroeder also said three of the rounds Hankison fired entered the apartment next to Taylor's, \"endangering the three lives in that apartment.\"\n\n\"Based upon my review, these are extreme violations of our policies,\" Schroeder wrote. \"I find your conduct a shock to the conscience. I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion. You have never been trained by the Louisville Metro Police Department to use deadly force in this fashion. Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department.\"\n\n\"I can not tolerate this type of conduct by any member of the Louisville Metro Police Department,\" he added. \"Your conduct demands your termination.\"\n\nThe three officers involved in the shooting\u2014Hankison, Jon Mattingly, and Myles Cosgrove\u2014had all been placed on administrative reassignment throughout the investigation. None of the officers have been charged, despite widespread protests and calls for arrests.\n\nIn the wake of Taylor's death, Louisville passed a ban on \"no-knock\" warrants, which allow police to enter a home without first announcing their presence.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking in Elections: Influence and Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2020 U.S. election, fact-checking has experienced significant growth, with numerous websites and news shows providing voters with information about the factual accuracy of political claims. However, the impact of fact-checkers on the public and politicians remains unclear.\n\nJulian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University, questions the effectiveness of fact-checkers, stating that politicians continue to stretch the truth or fabricate facts with little evidence of public outrage or significant changes in their behavior.\n\nOne of the main challenges for fact-checkers is the deeply distrustful political culture that has existed since the 1970s, with consistently low trust in government and politicians. The public's general impression of their leaders is often confirmed rather than challenged by fact-checking revelations.\n\nFact-checkers also operate in a media environment that has become more polarized and openly partisan in recent years. The public tends to rely on sources that align with their political views, making it difficult for objective fact-checkers to gain traction.\n\nMoreover, fact-checkers must compete with openly partisan fact-checkers, as political parties and organizations use these operations to further their own agendas. The distinction between partisan and real fact-checkers becomes blurred, making it challenging for the public to discern the truth.\n\nPartisanship in politics has resulted in a world where it is difficult to distinguish fact from partisan fiction. Fact checkers, with the objective of helping Americans understand the election choices, struggle to gain traction. When one of the players calls \"B.S.\" during the political cycle, people might be listening, but it's not clear that there are lasting consequences.",
    " Title: House Committee Subpoenas Former Trump Administration Official Over Security Clearance Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The House Committee on Oversight and Reform, led by Democrats, voted Tuesday to subpoena Carl Kline, a former personnel security director for the Trump administration, to discuss the granting of security clearances to individuals with questionable backgrounds. The vote was along party lines.\n\nThe committee is investigating allegations that the White House overruled security clearance denials made by lower-level officials, potentially posing a risk to national security. The subpoena is based on testimony from a whistleblower, a longtime White House security adviser who claimed that she and colleagues denied security clearances to about 25 applicants, only to see those decisions overturned by higher-ups in the Trump administration.\n\nTricia Newbold, a career employee who has returned to work at the White House, testified, \"I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security.\"\n\nThe group of 25 applicants may include President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was granted a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from officials, according to reports by The New York Times and The Washington Post in February. The specific applicants have not been identified by the committee.\n\nIssues with some applicants include ties to foreign influence, conflicts of interests, questionable or criminal conduct, financial problems, and drug abuse, according to testimony. The White House has rejected document requests from the committee, citing privacy and arguing that Congress does not have the authority to see these documents.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders stated, \"We're not going to exploit individuals and their personal information.\" Speaking with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday, Kushner said, \"I did not want to discuss the clearance process, but I can say over the last two years that I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been accused of all different types of things, and all of those things have turned out to be false.\"\n\nHouse Democrats are planning subpoenas in a number of investigations of the Trump White House. The House Judiciary Committee will meet Wednesday to authorize a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller's full report and the evidence his investigators gathered, setting up what could be a historic legal clash with the Justice Department. The committee also plans to vote to authorize subpoenas for evidence from some of Trump's former top advisers, including strategist Steve Bannon, communications director Hope Hicks, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, White House counsel Donald McGahn, and counsel Ann Donaldson.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, accused the Democrats of politicizing security clearances and exaggerating the problems. \"For instance,\" he said, \"the 25 examples of overruled recommendations by Ms. Newbold heralded by the Democrats include nonpolitical officials such as a GSA custodian.\"\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md), stated, \"The evidence suggests the administration has been careless with security clearances and access to the nation's secrets.\" Newbold's testimony, he said, reflected \"the grave security risks she has been witnessing firsthand over the past two years.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Diplomats Call for Military Pressure on Syria's Assad Regime through Dissent Channel\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 50 U.S. State Department officials have signed an internal memo advocating for a change in the United States' approach to Syria, specifically urging military pressure on Bashar Assad's regime to push him toward the negotiating table. The diplomats expressed their opposition to the current U.S. policy through a cable on the State Department's dissent channel, a mechanism established for such purposes.\n\nAccording to NPR's Michele Kelemen, it is unusual for so many officials to sign on to such a cable. The cable reportedly calls for targeted military strikes against the Assad regime, a measure the Obama administration has been reluctant to implement. Such action would put the U.S. on a potential collision course with Russia, which is currently backing the Assad regime and working with Secretary of State John Kerry on a cease-fire and a diplomatic path that has stalled.\n\nThe New York Times, which has seen a copy of the memo, reports that the diplomats argue they are not advocating for a confrontation with Russia. However, they believe a credible military threat against Assad is necessary to pressure him to negotiate.\n\nThe cable reportedly states, \"The moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria, after five years of brutal war, is evident and unquestionable... The status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire, if not disastrous, humanitarian, diplomatic and terrorism-related challenges.\"\n\nThe American Foreign Service Association, which represents active and retired members of the Foreign Service, said in a statement that \"constructive dissent is a core tenet of the Foreign Service.\" The association added, \"America's diplomats are tasked with addressing some of the world's most complex challenges in order to protect America's people and national security\u2014a charge that requires a professional environment that values candor and debate when the stakes are high and the costs of failure are unacceptable. We applaud the individuals who had the intellectual courage to express their dissent.\"\n\nThe dissent channel was established in 1971 during the Vietnam War and is meant for \"dissenting and alternative views on substantive foreign policy issues.\" Messages sent through the channel are immediately distributed to the secretary of state and other leaders in the department. Cables sent through the channel are supposed to remain confidential.\n\nIn 2004, Michele reported on the State Department diplomats who expressed their objections to the war in Iraq. At the time, she reported that about six messages a year were sent through the channel. \"One little lonely voice out in the wild reaches of Mongolia was certainly not going to turn the train of war around,\" one diplomat who sent an anti-war dissent cable told Michele. However, even if it would not change history, the diplomat wanted her concerns put in writing and read by the country's top diplomat.",
    " Title: Trump's Controversial Pardons Raise Concerns Over Clemency Abuse and Impact on Anti-Corruption Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked criticism from the left, former President Donald Trump granted clemency to several individuals with personal connections to him, raising concerns about the potential impact on the federal government's anti-corruption efforts. The pardons, which were granted in the final days of Trump's presidency, have been criticized as self-serving and politically motivated.\n\nThe individuals granted clemency include Rod Blagojevich, a former Illinois governor who was convicted on charges of bribery, fraud, and lying to investigators, among other offenses. Blagojevich was a contestant on Trump's reality TV show, \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" and was prosecuted by Patrick Fitzgerald, a close friend of and lawyer for James Comey.\n\nOther recipients of Trump's clemency include Michael Milken, a financier who has hosted annual financial conferences that are frequented by Trump's wealthy associates, and Bernard Kerik, a former police commissioner who was appointed by Rudolph Giuliani. Additionally, Trump granted clemency to Ed DeBartolo Jr., a former San Francisco 49ers owner, who was pardoned after a large group of former professional football players, with whom Trump has had a favorable relationship, championed his cause.\n\nThe pardons were granted personally by Trump, and there is concern that the grants were made as a reward for political support or personal favoritism. The world will not change significantly as a result of these actions, as only Blagojevich was still incarcerated at the time of the pardons. However, critics argue that the pardons further degrade the government and move the system closer to a cult of personality.\n\nTrump has also been accused of misrepresenting the nature of the Blagojevich case, claiming that Blagojevich was only charged for one phone call that could have been just talk. In fact, the charges related to a month's worth of discussions and three separate corruption-related incidents.\n\nThe pardons have also raised concerns about the potential for Trump to grant clemency to convicted associates such as Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign chairman, and Roger Stone. If Trump were to grant clemency to figures such as Manafort and Stone, it would be an even more egregious corruption of the pardon power.\n\nPresidents do have the unquestioned power to grant clemency, and past presidents have used it to pardon or commute the sentences of acquaintances or friends of friends. However, no past president has been as transparently transactional in doling out clemency as Trump. Friend, friend of a friend, or famous individual seems to be a good chance of being considered for a pardon in Trump's world.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has also been in the news recently, following her decision to tear up a copy of Trump's State of the Union address on live television. Pelosi's talents have always lain in the less glamorous, less public side of politics. She is good at whipping up votes in her caucus and disciplining dissenters. She is good at offering incentives and punishments to get Democratic members of Congress to do what she wants them to do. To rip up the speech on television was a bit of theatricality, sure \u2013 a ploy designed to get attention. It also worked. The day after Trump made a long speech full of misinformation that tried to make a case for his re-election, no one is talking about him. Instead, we are talking about the speaker of the House. That, too, is a skill, one that Pelosi seems to be honing.",
    " Title: Millennial Voters Favor Libertarian Gary Johnson Over Hillary Clinton, Polls Show\n\nArticle:\n\nA number of recent polls indicate that Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson is performing well among millennial voters, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is underperforming with the same demographic that helped President Obama build winning coalitions in 2008 and 2012.\n\nAccording to a New York Times/CBS poll, 26 percent of voters under the age of 29 support Johnson, with an additional 10 percent supporting Green presidential nominee Jill Stein. A Quinnipiac poll shows Johnson at 29 percent of young voters, and Stein at 15 percent. In that poll, Clinton barely edges out Johnson among young voters, receiving 31 percent, while Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is at 26 percent among that demographic. A Global Strategy Group poll of millennials in 11 battleground states found 73 percent of millennials labeling Trump as a racist, and just 38 percent supporting Clinton in a four-way matchup.\n\nThe results have sparked concern among older liberals who feel the vote of millennials belongs to them. Clara Jeffrey, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, tweeted that she has \"never hated millennials more\" in response to the NYT/CBS poll, which garnered refreshing responses from millennials. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat quipped that it looked \"like 'liberaltarianism' is a real thing\" and that Donald Trump was \"very glad\" of it.\n\nWhile Republicans have a few politicians who could be called 'liberaltarian,' Trump is not. In a tight race, those votes could be crucial, and Trump has nothing to offer them. Similarly, Democrats' nominee has nothing to offer a demographic that has increasingly become more libertarian-friendly.\n\nA 2014 McClatchy-Marist poll of millennials found 66 percent of them believing government was wasteful and inefficient, even as many said they planned to vote Democrat in that year and in 2016. The drop-off in support for Democrats is unsurprising, given that the rhetoric about government that Democrats deploy does not match the reality on the ground.\n\nThe narrative of the older generation of liberals is that Donald Trump is so bad, voters have to hold their nose and vote for Clinton. The option alone of a third-party vote is skewered online, mostly by establishment liberals who have increasingly come to represent the poor policy-making that has led to a mammoth-sized debt and veritable police state in the U.S. and U.S. warfare state abroad. Donald Trump does not \"scare\" millennials as much as the mess older voters have made of the country. Clinton's courting of neo-conservatives and figures like Henry Kissinger only serves to alienate millennials more.\n\nJohnson's refusal to play political games, like powering through a question about Aleppo without knowing what it's in reference to, while it makes him an easy target for the media establishment to mock, likely ingratiates him to millennials who see both Trump and Clinton as products of a corrupt political system their parents' generation has glorified.\n\nClinton and President Obama's decision to call Trump a break from Republican tradition instead of the inevitable evolution of it, as more dishonest partisans might frame it, has also placed Johnson and the Libertarian Party in a better position. Millennials are used to start-ups. They are early adopters whose behaviors and decisions are helping drive old giants of industry out of business, from Blockbuster to taxicabs. The latest polls suggest they have the potential to disrupt the political industry in this country in the same way they've disrupted so many others.\n\nAll the fearmongering over Trump, the cries of false equivalency, and the attempts by millennial \"influencers\" like Vox.com to frame the Clinton campaign as something transformative millennials ought to get behind, won't bring millennials to heel in the way major parties were able to in days gone by. Neither will false alarms about \"spoilers\" (spoiler: third parties are not spoilers, shitty candidates are).\n\nThe persistence of never Trump Republicans (even if they do not go for Johnson) combined with Obama and Clinton's refusal (as of yet) to smear the principles of limited government, freedom, and Constitutionalism with Trumpism because of Republicans' history of running on those principles while never acting on them, and the Libertarian party's decision to nominate socially tolerant and fiscally responsible candidates (as many millennials describe themselves) means millennials have the chance to catapult the Libertarian party into major party status, if not through this election cycle alone, almost certainly in cycles to come. Both millennials and Libertarians should expect the smears and attacks to become more vociferous and detached from reality as the old establishment partisan order slowly but surely comes to an end.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Take Divergent Approaches to National Unrest and Police Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing protests following the killing of George Floyd have dominated the national conversation for the past two weeks, with demonstrations starting in Minneapolis and spreading to cities across the country showing no signs of abating. As the upcoming presidential election, which is less than five months away, approaches, the issues of police violence and civil unrest are likely to remain at the forefront.\n\nThe two candidates, President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, have taken drastically different approaches in their responses to the protests. President Trump has repeatedly called on authorities to \"dominate\" demonstrators, going so far as to suggest invoking his authority to deploy the U.S. military in American cities. \"I am your president of law and order,\" Trump said in an address last week before leaving the White House to walk to a nearby church in an area that had recently been cleared of peaceful protesters by police and the National Guard.\n\nIn contrast, Joe Biden has attempted to strike a more unifying tone while speaking out about the need to address \"systemic racism\" in the country. He has visited protests in several cities and met privately with Floyd's family in Houston on Monday. \"I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate,\" Biden said during a speech last week.\n\nThe last time the country experienced such widespread unrest was in 1968, during one of the most chaotic periods in American history, marked by the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and deadly riots in several cities. Republican Richard Nixon emphasized a return to \"law and order\" en route to a decisive win over Democrat Hubert Humphrey.\n\nBy echoing Nixon's message, Trump could appeal to voters who crave a return to stability. The intense focus on police violence also draws attention away from the administration's response to the coronavirus, which voters largely see as a failure, according to polls. The coming months may also provide the president with an opportunity to capitalize on divisions within the various wings of the Democratic Party, such as the debate over defunding the police.\n\nSkeptics argue that an election 52 years ago shouldn't be treated as indicative of what might happen today. Besides, Nixon in 1968 was running to replace a Democrat in the White House. It's much more difficult for a sitting president to make the case that he'll bring a return to normalcy when he's been in charge the whole time, some pundits argue.\n\nEven if a \"law and order\" message could be effective, Trump is the wrong candidate to capitalize on that opportunity given the upheaval he's brought to Washington during his presidency, political analysts argue.\n\nEarly polling suggests that Trump's response is hurting rather than helping. Trump's appeal to order could be convincing for some voters, according to Ron Grossman of the Chicago Tribune. On the other hand, Biden's history makes him a poor messenger for police reform, as noted by Charles Lane of the Washington Post. The focus on race relations turns attention away from the coronavirus, according to Stephen Collinson of CNN. Trump can also blame Democratic leaders for issues in their cities, as pointed out by Timothy J. Lynch in The Conversation.\n\nIt's too early to know how the ongoing unrest will affect voters come November, but early polling suggests that Trump's response is hurting rather than helping.",
    " Title: Trump Shifts to a More Positive Tone for State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich, who has advised President Donald Trump, stated that the president is transitioning from his combative persona to a more victorious one in his upcoming State of the Union address. Gingrich described this shift as a move from \"Trump the fighter\" to \"Trump the winner.\"\n\nAccording to Gingrich, the president is adopting a more conciliatory tone, expressing a sense of not needing to engage in confrontations. This change is aimed at promoting the booming economy and the enactment of his tax plan without the use of divisive language that may cloud his message.\n\nWhile some of Trump's advisers may prefer a darker and more strident tone, White House officials are aiming for a more inclusive speech in terms of tone, if not substance. The speech has been compiled by Stephen Miller, another speechwriter, and Rob Porter, the president's staff secretary, who coordinated input from various government departments.\n\nThere is a heightened awareness among White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill that Trump's tendency to deviate from the script, insert divisive remarks, and make confusing non-sequiturs often overshadows the main topic. However, officials believe that as long as Trump adheres to his script during the address, he will be viewed positively in many circles.\n\nCorey Stewart, a Tea Party Trump supporter from Virginia running for Senate in the state, commented that Trump is looking forward to the midterm elections in November and his own re-election in 2020. Stewart added that Trump understands the need to mobilize his base but also expand it by discussing non-contentious issues.",
    " Title: Historical Parallels and Consequences of Political Polarization in the United States: A Case Study of Moses Dunbar\n\nArticle:\n\nPolitical polarization in the United States, as evidenced by unfavorable opinions and fear of opposing parties, has intensified since the 2016 Pew Research Center surveys. This is not the first time the nation has experienced such divisions, with historical examples dating back to the birth of the nation and the American Revolution.\n\nOne such example is the story of Moses Dunbar, a Connecticut farmer who remained neutral during the American Revolution but faced severe consequences as a result. Dunbar, who supported the British monarchy but not the Parliamentary taxes and measures that drove patriots into opposition, was seen as a threat by Connecticut patriots.\n\nAs the imperial crisis escalated in 1774, Dunbar called for a peaceful resolution to the \"Unhappy Misunderstanding\" between Britain and the colonies. However, once the war began in April 1775, such calls for moderation had little chance of being heard. Fear of British military retaliation led Connecticut patriots to identify suspected loyalists and subdue them by any means possible.\n\nDunbar was arrested, convicted of treason, and executed on March 17, 1777. He was the only loyalist executed for treason by the state of Connecticut. The authorities' extreme measures against suspected British sympathizers, as demonstrated by Dunbar's case, offer a vivid example of what can happen when fear and suspicion lead people to translate a complex situation into a stark opposition of friends versus foes.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of Dunbar's execution demonstrates how a fractured society can begin to heal its wounds. Once the War for Independence ended, many loyalists fled the United States, but many more stayed in the new nation. Dunbar's descendants belonged to this group, and some of them continued to reside among the very people who had harassed and betrayed him. Despite the years of conflict, former adversaries evidently made a decision to cease making enemies of their neighbors, concentrating on what they had in common rather than what drove them apart.\n\nThe story of Moses Dunbar serves as a reminder of the dangers of extreme partisanship and the importance of finding common ground in a divided society. The image credit for this article is a postcard depicting Old Newgate Prison, where Dunbar was imprisoned.",
    " Title: Obama Vows to Pursue Closure of Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has expressed his intention to push for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility during his final two years in office, potentially fulfilling a campaign promise he has yet to accomplish. In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Obama stated, \"I'm going to be doing everything I can to close it.\"\n\nThe President cited the facility's role in inspiring jihadists and extremists worldwide as a reason for its closure, stating, \"It is contrary to our values.\" The President's comments follow a series of executive actions, including an overhaul of U.S. immigration rules, new regulations aimed at curbing environmentally-harmful emissions, and a deal to thaw economic relations with Cuba.\n\nThe Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which Obama pledged to shut down as part of his 2008 campaign, has been a point of contention due to a law passed by Congress that prohibits the President from doing so. Obama has transferred many of the detainees housed at the facility to other countries in recent months, and plans to continue this process, as Congress has not allowed him to shift those detainees into federal Supermax facilities within the United States.\n\nObama stated, \"We are going to continue to place those who have been cleared for release or transfer to host countries that are willing to take them.\" The President acknowledged the challenge of dealing with \"some really hard cases\" where \"we know they've done something wrong and are still dangerous.\" However, he expressed his desire to close the facility, stating, \"I think that it does not make sense for us to spend millions of dollars per individual when we have a way of solving this problem that's more consistent with our values.\"",
    " Title: The Dilemma of Ambition and Femininity: A Personal Reflection on Hillary Clinton's Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing struggle faced by women in balancing ambition and traditional gender roles is a common experience shared by many, as demonstrated in a personal account by an unnamed author. The author describes an internal, critical voice that has persistently judged her professional decisions, either for being too feminine or not feminine enough. This dilemma, the author argues, is a result of the societal expectation that ambitious and successful women often face a backlash for challenging traditional gender norms.\n\nThe author's personal account is set against the backdrop of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which offers a glimpse of a world where such restrictive gender norms may no longer be a barrier to success. The author suggests that Clinton's campaign will inspire a realization of the absurdity of these gender norms and allow women to overcome their internal critical voices.\n\nThe author criticizes a recent column by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times, which offers advice to Hillary Clinton on how to campaign as a woman. Dowd's column suggests that Clinton's past political failures were due to her not embodying the correct amount of femininity. The author finds this criticism absurd, as Clinton is more hawkish than the rest of the Democratic Party and advocates for issues such as paid leave for working women, which is not currently guaranteed in the United States.\n\nThe author concludes by expressing relief at the absurdity of the standard being shriveled in the sunlight and finding humor in the suggestion that Hillary Clinton should emulate the bossy and ambitious caricature of herself portrayed on Saturday Night Live. The author ends by using Clinton's political career as a measure of success and stating that if failure is defined as Clinton's career, then the author is ready to sign up.",
    " Title: Supreme Court and Subsidies for Health Plans on Federal Exchanges: A Political Battle\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is not currently facing a serious legal case to eliminate subsidies for health plans on federally facilitated health insurance exchanges. This assertion is made by New York Times' Supreme Court columnist Linda Greenhouse in a recent article, stating that such a decision would contradict the conservative justices' previous views on statutory interpretation.\n\nGreenhouse argues that the conservative justices, who form a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court, would have to disregard their established approach to statutory interpretation and their views on how Congress should interact with the states to reject the government's defense of the law.\n\nThe political leanings of the conservative justices are a point of contention, with Greenhouse suggesting they may be motivated by a political agenda to dismantle the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The decision, it is believed, will once again fall on the shoulders of Chief Justice John Roberts, who upheld the individual mandate in 2012, albeit in a manner that was not considered a neutral interpretation of the law.\n\nRoberts' decision to uphold the individual mandate, but not on the Commerce Clause, and his gutting of Medicaid, may have led him to regret allowing the Affordable Care Act to survive. This second opportunity to revisit the issue could provide him with an opportunity to reverse his previous decision.\n\nThe potential chaos that a ruling against the government in King v. Burwell could cause to the country's healthcare system is a concern for Roberts, a political consideration that should not factor into a justice's decision-making process. The White House is reportedly focusing on convincing Roberts that there is no safety net for such a ruling, while the Republicans are working to convince him that everything will be \"hunky-dory\" if he rules in their favor and eliminates subsidies for insurance plans bought on federally facilitated exchanges.\n\nDuring a testy hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell was pressed for details on the administration's backup plan should the court eliminate subsidies for insurance plans bought on federally facilitated exchanges. Burwell repeatedly dodged questions, stating her focus is on meeting targets for the open enrollment period.\n\nTwo former Bush HHS officials who spoke with The Hill suggest that the administration is keeping their contingency plans close to the chest to avoid signaling \"weakness\" to Chief Justice John Roberts. Former HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt, who left office in 2009, added that he isn't surprised that senior officials would rather face a day of bad headlines than signal weakness to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Republican party, which controls both chambers of Congress, is reportedly working to signal strength, comfort, and reassurance, while the administration is keeping their plans close to the chest to avoid signaling weakness to the Supreme Court. This dynamic is a part of the ongoing political battle surrounding the Affordable Care Act and the subsidies for health plans on federally facilitated exchanges.",
    " Title: Obama's Visit to Hiroshima Amidst Asian Nuclear Arms Race Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's upcoming trip to Asia, which includes a stop in Hiroshima, will focus on the city's dark nuclear past. However, Obama's visit comes at a time when U.S. and Asian officials express concerns about a potentially dangerous nuclear future in the region, potentially reversing Obama's pledge to curb the spread of nuclear arms.\n\nNorth Korea is reportedly expanding its nuclear arsenal and upgrading its ballistic missiles. China is modernizing its nuclear stockpile. Notably, Pentagon planners worry that Japan and South Korea might, for the first time, consider developing nuclear arms of their own. This speculation is partly due to the recent conclusion by U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies that North Korea's unpredictable regime can now mount a small nuclear warhead on missiles capable of striking Japan and South Korea.\n\nDonald Trump's recent comments on Asia's nuclear-weapons-free Japan have raised concerns. Trump questioned the assumption of a nuclear-weapons-free Japan, stating, \"Wouldn\u2019t you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\" Japan, scarred by the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has forsworn nuclear weapons since World War II, though it operates a nuclear energy program.\n\nObama's visit to Hiroshima, which was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb in August 1945, will promote a message contrasting Trump's. \"It\u2019s an opportunity to focus the world\u2019s attention on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them,\" said deputy national adviser Ben Rhodes.\n\nObama's broader goal of limiting nuclear proliferation, a long-stated objective, has yielded mixed results. Obama secured a nuclear deal with Iran that halted its path to a bomb, but has not achieved significant reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal due to Russia's resistance to comparable cuts. He has also not slowed nuclear expansions in North Korea and Pakistan.\n\nAsia now emerges as a potential nuclear danger zone, following the Iran deal that averted a predicted nuclear arms race in the Middle East. North Korea continues to press on with its weapons program, with recent satellite imagery suggesting it may be preparing for its fifth nuclear test.\n\nGovernments in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are growing impatient with international efforts to thwart Pyongyang's program. Some suspect China is content with a status quo that keeps North Korea contained and stable.\n\nConcerns about the U.S.'s reliability as an ally are increasing, particularly in Japan, which has a post-World War II policy of pacifism enshrined in its constitution. Last year, Japan passed legislation reinterpreting its constitution to allow foreign military operations for the first time since World War II, though only for defensive purposes.\n\nSome officials and analysts suggest the anti-nuclear taboo is being revisited, especially as China asserts new territorial claims, including over islands and waters claimed by Japan. At the same time, many Japanese leaders feel that Obama has not challenged Beijing forcefully enough. Trump's suggestion that Japan and South Korea might need to fend for themselves has only exacerbated these concerns that America can no longer be relied on for protection.\n\n\"Careless American rhetoric that calls into question America\u2019s security commitment in general and extended nuclear deterrent in particular fuels Tokyo\u2019s security planners to develop hedging strategies,\" said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n\"It has often been thought that Japan has a bomb in the basement, and it would just have to assemble the parts to create a bomb,\" Cronin added. \"The technical challenges might actually be much greater than that, but it is the political hurdles that remain the real barriers to Japan acquiring nuclear weapons.\"\n\nShortly after Trump's comments in March, the governor of Japan's Osaka prefecture told reporters that the country should revisit the question of nuclear weapons. \"What do we do if America\u2019s military strength [in Japan] disappears?\" asked the governor, Ichiro Matsui. \"Wishful thinking doesn\u2019t get us anywhere.\"\n\nOther Japanese conservatives have made similar arguments in recent years, including Shintaro Ishihara, who served as Tokyo's governor until 2012 and said in 2011 that Japan \"should absolutely possess nuclear weapons.\"\n\nSuch talk has been striking to Japan experts in the U.S., who have assumed for decades that the country would remain non-nuclear. \"Very few except the extreme fringes used to talk about nuclear weapons\" in Japan, said Richard Samuels, director of MIT's Center for International Studies.\n\nPro-nuclear weapons sentiment in Japan remains mostly on the far right. However, the same conversation is brewing in South Korea, where a 2013 poll found that two-thirds of South Koreans support developing nukes in response to its bellicose northern neighbor.\n\n\"Seoul can no longer sit idly by as the [nuclear] talks lead to no results and Washington and Beijing are busy blaming each other for their diplomatic failures,\" argued an editorial in Seoul's conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper earlier this year.\n\nSuch talk \"is driven by a deep fear of abandonment\" by the U.S., Cronin said. Obama himself was dismissive when asked about Trump's talk of allowing Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear weapons, stating they reveal that \"Trump doesn\u2019t know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally.\" The U.S. alliance with Japan and South Korea, he added, \"is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific region,\" he said, adding that it \"has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation\" in the region.",
    " Title: Health Insurance and the Problem of Overconsumption: Understanding Adverse Selection and the Death Spiral\n\nArticle:\n\nThe regulation of healthcare professionals, such as physicians, dentists, and nurses, is a response to the challenge of monitoring product quality in the healthcare industry. Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration oversees the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals.\n\nHealthcare spending can be unpredictable and expensive, contrasting with the predictability of expenses for items like housing, food, and transportation. Healthcare expenses can arise unexpectedly and significantly impact a person's finances.\n\nHealth insurance addresses this issue by pooling risks among the population, reducing financial uncertainty. However, this reliance on third-party payers introduces a new problem: insured consumers may overconsume healthcare services due to reduced financial incentives.\n\nFor instance, when insurance covers doctor visits without out-of-pocket costs, patients may seek medical attention more frequently for minor symptoms. Physicians may also order unnecessary tests when insurance companies cover the bill.\n\nTo counteract this issue, insurers implement copays, deductibles, and service access restrictions. However, these measures reduce the pooling of risks and can create conflicts between insurers and their customers.\n\nAnother problem that arises in insurance markets is adverse selection. This occurs when customers differ in relevant ways (such as having a chronic disease) and these differences are known to the customers but not to insurers. This can result in an expensive mix of insured individuals.\n\nAdverse selection can lead to a phenomenon known as the death spiral. In this scenario, if insurance companies charge everyone the same price, basing the price on the average person's health characteristics may lead to healthier individuals dropping out of the insured pool. With a sicker customer base, the company faces higher costs and must increase the price of insurance. This higher price induces the next healthiest group of people to drop insurance, leading to a cycle of rising costs and prices. As this process continues, more people drop their coverage, the insured pool becomes less healthy, and the price keeps rising. In extreme cases, the insurance market may disappear.",
    " Title: Egyptian Interim President's Office Denies Appointment of Mohamed ElBaradei as Prime Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nThe office of the interim Egyptian president has denied reports of the appointment of Mohamed ElBaradei as prime minister. This development comes after the second-largest Islamist party in Egypt, Salfi el-Nour, reportedly rejected the appointment.\n\nInitially, reports of ElBaradei's appointment were made by news agencies such as Reuters, Al Jazeera, BBC, and the Associated Press, citing \"presidential\" sources. The Associated Press also heard the same from an \"opposition source.\" ElBaradei's spokesman had informed NPR that he would be sworn in as prime minister around 1:30 p.m. ET, but later retracted the statement.\n\nThe nation's military, following Wednesday's ousting of President Mohammed Morsi, installed Adly Mansour, chief justice of Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court, as interim president. He is expected to serve until elections can be held. Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, was in office for just one year and was removed after massive protests due to discontent over Egypt's economic problems and his Muslim Brotherhood Party.\n\nMohamed ElBaradei, a former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has a history in diplomacy. As special assistant to the Egyptian foreign minister in 1978, he served on the negotiating team at the historic Camp David peace talks that led to Egypt's peace treaty and diplomatic relations with Israel. He began his U.N. career in 1980 and was sent to Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf war to dismantle Saddam's nuclear program.",
    " Title: China's Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Look at Transparency, Deception, and the Global Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe novel coronavirus, responsible for the ongoing global pandemic, is believed to have undergone natural selection, with the ability to infect and spread among humans. The genetic material in the current virus shares an 82% match with the earlier SARS virus, while another type of coronavirus found in bats matches at 89%. The origin of the virus remains unclear, with some evidence suggesting it could have originated from animals or an inadvertent spill from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research on bat coronaviruses.\n\nIn the early stages of the outbreak, China's system and its deceptions are said to have worsened the situation. Local officials attempted to clamp down on information, and when doctors expressed concern about the new sickness, they were reprimanded for spreading rumors. One of these doctors, Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist, later died of the virus. He had spoken up in an online chat group on Dec. 30, 2019, while the Wuhan Health Commission was telling hospitals not to say anything publicly.\n\nIn the critical early weeks of January 2020, as the virus spread, the local and national governments kept the lid on public information. President Xi Jinping was reportedly aware of the virus spread on Jan. 7, but the public was not warned until Jan. 20, seven days later. Wuhan was put into lockdown on Jan. 23.\n\nChina's official death toll seemed low compared to the size of the population, and anecdotal evidence described many more deaths. On Friday, China revised the Wuhan death toll upward by 50%, to 3,869. This revision is a welcome step towards transparency, but more investigation is needed for the whole country.\n\nChina has launched a campaign to portray President Xi as the hero who vanquished the virus. Some Chinese officials have gone so far as to claim that the United States created the virus, while others have claimed that China's authoritarian model should be emulated. However, the part of China's campaign that is most troubling is the claim that China's system should be emulated. The model, characterized by deception, cover-up, and rewriting history, is part of the problem, not the solution.\n\nThe United States and China need to cooperate to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. China is critical in the global supply chain for drugs and personal protective equipment, and is an economic superpower. China and the rest of the world must also confront infectious disease together, not use it to score points. The model, deception, cover-up, and rewriting history, is part of the problem, not the solution.",
    " Title: Unemployment Claims Reach Record High as Coronavirus Pandemic Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Labor reported a new weekly total of 28.9 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits, adding to the 22 million who had sought benefits in previous weeks. This unprecedented volume has overwhelmed state systems for processing unemployment claims. Economists estimate the national unemployment rate to be between 15 and 20 percent, significantly higher than during the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, when the peak unemployment rate was about 10 percent.\n\nThe unemployment rate during the Great Depression was approximately 25 percent. The new weekly jobless claims figure is comparable to the 5.2 million people who filed for unemployment benefits for the week ended April 11.\n\nAs the coronavirus began spreading in the United States earlier this year, many businesses rapidly closed, with hotels, restaurants, and airlines being particularly hard-hit. However, few businesses have remained unaffected by the economic toll. The problems have worsened each week, as more Americans reduced their spending and more businesses cut workers due to the sharp decline in income.\n\nLabor economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter stated that many businesses quickly \"cut to the bone\" when they realized the pandemic would gut sales. Now, many of the new layoffs stem from businesses like news organizations and tech companies that weren't directly affected by people staying home but are suffering the consequences of vanishing ad revenue and paid subscriptions.\n\nConsumer spending, the engine behind the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, has evaporated. If they're still operating, many offices are working with skeleton staffs and staring down months of dismal revenue.\n\nThe White House and Congress have tried to intervene, but with limited impact so far. New funding for small businesses in a $2 trillion March emergency spending package quickly dried up in the face of overwhelming demand, prompting the Senate to expand funding by $310 billion on Tuesday. The bill would direct an additional $60 billion to a separate small-business emergency grant and loan program. The House approved the measure 388 to 5 on Thursday afternoon.\n\nEven with all the new government spending, hopes for a sharp economic rebound are fading, overtaken by the public fear of going back to restaurants, movie theaters, schools, and gyms. The growing possibility of a W-shaped recovery\u2014in which a resurgence of the virus or a spike in defaults and bankruptcies triggers another downturn\u2014has analysts reframing what a reopened or rehabilitated economy might look like.\n\nThis year defies historical comparison. In 2020, 28.9 million people have filed for unemployment benefits. Halfway through the fourth month of the year, the figure has already eclipsed the full-year totals of every year but 1982 (30.4 million) and 2009 (29.8 million). At this rate, it will overtake both within a week or so.\n\nLess than half of working-age Americans will be earning a wage next month, said James Knightley, ING Chief International Economist.\n\n\"In an election year, this means that the call for politicians to reopen the economy is only going to get louder, irrespective of the health advice,\" Knightley said.\n\nIn five weeks, 9.4 percent of the working-age population has filed for unemployment insurance, said Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab's director of economic research. That's about twice the share of the population that lost a job during the Great Recession. In some states, such as Michigan, about one in four workers has filed an unemployment claim in the past few weeks.\n\n\"The numbers detailing the shock to the U.S. labor market are so large, and cover such a short time, that your first reaction is that they're a typo,\" Bunker said.\n\nEmployers are also unlikely to be hiring at the same levels they were before the pandemic. As of April 16, job postings on Indeed were down 34 percent compared with last year, Bunker said.\n\nThe job losses, like the epidemic itself, haven't fallen evenly across the country. In three states\u2014Hawaii, Kentucky, and Michigan\u2014about 1 in 4 workers have filed for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks. In Michigan, plant shutdowns and furloughs have ravaged the manufacturing economy, which had only recently recovered all the jobs it lost in the Great Recession.\n\nOn the opposite of the ledger sits South Dakota, where Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) has resisted calls to lock down the state's businesses to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Only 6 percent of the state's labor force has applied for unemployment benefits. It may be a regional trend: Neighboring Wyoming and Nebraska, and nearby Utah, also have unusually low claims numbers.\n\nAs part of its sprawling stimulus package, Washington has rolled out relief for millions of households and small businesses struggling to make ends meet. However, money for struggling businesses quickly ran dry, and system glitches have prevented $1,200 stimulus checks from reaching some of the neediest.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill to expand the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses by $310 billion, and flood a separate small-business emergency grant and loan initiative by an additional $60 billion. Meanwhile, many low-income veterans and Social Security recipients still haven't received the stimulus money in their bank accounts, while other IRS checks are going to dead people. People who didn't file tax returns last year or don't have direct-deposit information may have weeks more to wait.",
    " Title: Carly Fiorina Shines in Republican Debate, Trump's Performance Remains Consistent\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 Republican presidential debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, may have been more fitting at the Hearst Castle, given the shared history between William Randolph Hearst and the current frontrunner, Donald Trump. Both Hearst and Trump ran for president, and both were known for their affinity towards wealth and perceived concern for the common people.\n\nThe debate aimed to answer three key questions:\n\n1. Could the GOP's non-politician trio - Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina - demonstrate they are more than a protest vote?\n2. Could former Florida Governor Jeb Bush display passion and wit, traits he is known to possess but seldom shows?\n3. Could Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker rejuvenate a campaign that has stalled in the early primary states?\n\nTrump, as expected, maintained his usual style, offering no signs of growth in his domestic and foreign policy views. Carson spoke sparingly, a stark contrast to other attention-seeking debaters. Carly Fiorina's performance will be discussed later in this article.\n\nJeb Bush showed improvement from his performance in the Cleveland Fox News debate. Notable moments included standing up to Trump and defending his brother, and choosing \"Eveready\" as his Secret Service name. This should reassure his nervous financial base, at least for now.\n\nWalker had another challenging night, facing criticism for skipping the California Republican Party's convention. His campaign struggles continue, as he focuses on regaining momentum in Iowa.\n\nA recurring issue in the GOP debates is the uneven playing field, with Trump often dominating the close-up moments, leaving other candidates in a disadvantageous position. This could be due to Trump's compelling rhetoric or the moderators' efforts to maintain audience engagement.\n\nCarly Fiorina, the standout of the debate, demonstrated depth and clarity in her responses, particularly on defense strategy and her criticism of Hillary Clinton. She handled Trump's interruptions with grace and offered thoughtful responses to questions, distinguishing herself from the other candidates.\n\nTrump had several flat moments, including comments about Rand Paul's hair and his interactions with Columba Bush. His ideas remained underdeveloped, suggesting that his campaign may not be as enduring as some might think.\n\nIn conclusion, Carly Fiorina's performance was a highlight of the debate, while Trump's performance remained consistent. The GOP is likely to face internal conflicts over government shutdowns, Planned Parenthood funding, and the Iran deal, which could fuel Trump's campaign. However, signs suggest that the appeal of Trump's unconventional style may be starting to wear thin.",
    " Title: Trump Acknowledges Regret Over Past Comments, Shifts Tone in Campaign Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in his campaign strategy, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump acknowledged that his past comments may have caused pain and expressed regret for some of his statements during a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. The remarks came as Trump was trying to rescue a campaign that has struggled since the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions from a series of self-created distractions.\n\nTrump, reading from prepared text, said, \"Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you do not choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that.\" He added, \"And believe it or not, I regret it\u2014and I do regret it\u2014particularly where it may have caused personal pain.\"\n\nThe GOP nominee pledged to \"always tell you the truth\" and promised to be the \"voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.\" Trump's decision to tap Stephen Bannon, a combative conservative media executive, as his new campaign chief, suggested a more confrontational approach. However, a new Trump emerged on Thursday: a less combative, more inclusive candidate.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump moved to invest nearly $5 million in battleground state advertising to address daunting challenges in the states that will make or break his White House ambitions. The New York businessman's campaign reserved television ad space over the coming 10 days in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. While Democrat Hillary Clinton has spent more than $75 million on advertising in 10 states since locking up her party's nomination, Trump's new investment marks his first of the general election season.\n\nTrump's shift in tone and attempt to appeal directly to non-white voters was met with skepticism by Clinton's campaign. Clinton's spokeswoman, Christina Reynolds, stated, \"We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize. But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying, and divisive comments he regrets\u2014and changes his tune altogether.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump's reboot comes too late, and whether he has the discipline to maintain it. Trump now trails Clinton in preference polls of most key battleground states. Election Day is 81 days away, with early voting in the first states set to begin in five weeks.",
    " Title: U.S. Political Figures React to U.K.'s Decision to Leave the European Union\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union has sparked reactions from U.S. political figures, with President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump offering contrasting views on the historic vote.\n\nIn a written statement, President Obama, who had advocated for Britain to remain in the union, said, \"The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship.\"\n\nTrump, who was in Scotland touring his golf resorts as the verdict came in, linked the campaign to his own populist bid. He said the vote underscores the need for \"tested leadership\" and suggested the result could be attributed to Obama's meddling.\n\nTrump held a press conference, highlighting what he described as the \"big parallel\" between the sentiments driving Britain's \"Leave\" campaign and those driving his own presidential bid. He emphasized the anger over high immigration levels, stating, \"They're angry over borders, they're angry over people coming into the country and taking over, nobody even knows who they are.\"\n\nPresumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, hours later, released a statement echoing Obama and others in saying the U.S. respects the choice of U.K. voters. Clinton also suggested the vote should strengthen her appeal in the U.S., stating the uncertainty \"only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods.\"\n\nThe Dow began to tumble as the vote results were announced, prompting Clinton to say, \"Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.\"\n\nThe outcome in Britain potentially sets up a domino effect of similar votes across Europe, testing the cohesion of the Western alliance, while throwing into question Britain's future trade relationship not only with E.U. countries but the United States.\n\nObama, in urging against Britain leaving the union, warned in April that Britain would be at the \"back of the queue\" in terms of striking a trade deal with the U.S. if it leaves. Trump, if he's president, vowed, \"They'll always be at the front of the line.\"\n\nTrump's reason for his trip to Europe was not politics, but rather to check on a pair of championship-level golf resorts he owns in Scotland. Trump, unlike previous presidential candidates, did not schedule any political meetings while abroad. He spent Friday morning marking the $200 million-plus rehabilitation of the famed Turnberry golf resort nestled on the rocky coast facing the North Atlantic Ocean.",
    " Title: Trump Delivers Unscripted, Controversial Speech in Pennsylvania Ahead of Special Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 73-minute campaign speech in Moon Township, Pennsylvania on Saturday, President Donald Trump delivered a swaggering, unscripted address that included taunts, insults, and vulgarity, while occasionally praising the man he was there to support, congressional candidate Rick Saccone. The stakes for Tuesday's special election are high for the Republican Party, with Saccone barely ahead of Democratic candidate Conor Lamb in a district that Trump won by 20 points.\n\nTrump's speech was not solely focused on the upcoming election, but also touched on various political issues, foreign policy, and personal matters. He expressed concern about the potential loss of Republican control of the House, stating that if Democrats were to retake the lower chamber, it would pose an existential threat to his presidency, as impeachment would become a possibility.\n\nTrump criticized Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Representative Maxine Waters, labeling Waters as a \"low-IQ individual.\" He also spoke about the ongoing investigations into his campaign's ties with Russia, stating that the Democrats are \"people that want to obstruct\" and \"want to stop us from doing things.\"\n\nThe speech also included references to foreign policy, with Trump criticizing Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto for refusing to pay for a border wall, threatening a trade war with the European Union over tariffs on steel and aluminum, and expressing his views on drug dealers, sanctuary cities, and \"chain migration.\"\n\nTrump also revisited the 2016 election, getting key facts wrong, such as claiming he received 52 percent of the women's vote, a statement that is only true if all non-white voters are excluded. Exit polls show that Trump won only 25 percent of Hispanic women and just 4 percent of black women.\n\nThe speech concluded with Trump's new slogan for the 2020 campaign: \"Keep America Great!\" He also mentioned his potential 2020 opponents, stating that he'd \"love to beat Oprah\" and that he knows \"her weakness.\"\n\nAs is typical at any Trump rally, the president took aim at the \"fake\" media, labeling CNN as \"fake as hell\" and \"the worst,\" and referring to Meet the Press host Chuck Todd as a \"sleeping son of a bitch.\"",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Accuses Koch Brothers of Trying to \"Buy the Country\" in Political Activities\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) criticized the political activities of the Koch brothers on Thursday, accusing them of attempting to \"buy the country.\" The comments came in response to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who criticized President Barack Obama's crackdown on politically active tax-exempt organizations.\n\nMcConnell, in his remarks, described the administration's proposed rules on those groups as a \"war on free speech\" and compared it to the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of outside groups. He accused Democrats of trying to stifle their election-year critics.\n\nReid countered by labeling the networks backed by David and Charles Koch as political organizations masquerading as social welfare groups. He criticized McConnell's efforts to help the Koch brothers.\n\n\"Because of a United States Supreme Court decision called Citizens United, there\u2019s been some really untoward stuff going on in the political world,\" Reid said. \"We have two brothers who are actually trying to buy the country.\"\n\nReid further stated that the Republican leader has been an opponent of campaign finance reform and that it is no surprise he opposes the administration's efforts for greater disclosure. He accused the Koch brothers of pretending to be social welfare organizations.\n\nThe administration's proposed rules would limit the ability of nonprofit groups organized around \"social welfare\" to engage in political activities. McConnell argued that Democrats are surveying a difficult midterm election cycle and trying to muzzle groups that back Republican candidates.\n\n\"Democrats think 2014 is shaping up to be a tough year for them politically,\" McConnell said. \"So instead of trying to persuade the public that they\u2019ve got the best answers to the problems we face, they try to shut everybody else out of the political process, they try to shut them up.\"\n\nThe Koch brothers, though major conservative financiers, have previously given to Democrats, including Senate Democrats. In 2010, they gave nearly $200,000 to Democratic candidates, including a $30,000 donation to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nReid acknowledged that the Koch-backed groups' spending poses a threat to Democrats, who are fighting to keep the Senate and preserve some control of Congress during Obama's last two years in office.\n\n\"What they\u2019re doing is spending their dollars on governors races, and on the state level and, of course, spending huge amounts of money around the country attempting to defeat Democrats both in the House and the Senate,\" Reid said. \"The Koch brothers hide all their campaign efforts. They disguise themselves with rare exception as social welfare organizations, with all these fancy names going after people who are trying to improve the country.\"\n\nSuch groups, also called 501(c)(4) nonprofits after a section of the Tax Code, have become an integral part of the campaign finance landscape in recent years. Democratic operatives as well as Republicans have used tax-exempt groups to shield donors from public scrutiny while still participating in elections. Government watchdogs say that such electoral activity might be a violation of tax law. The Treasury Department is currently considering new rules that would curtail some 501(c)(4) political activity.",
    " Title: Democratic Party Faces Challenges as Progressive Stances Elicit Mixed Reactions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently grappling with a series of political developments that have raised concerns about the party's direction and potential impact on its electoral prospects. In recent weeks, the party has been embroiled in debates over immigration policy, Supreme Court nominations, and the treatment of government officials.\n\nThe initial focus was on the controversial policy of family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, which drew widespread criticism. President Trump's reversal of the policy was seen as a victory for the Democrats, who have minimal control in Washington. However, the party's stance has since shifted, with several senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, advocating for the abolition or significant reform of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\nThis position has been criticized as a call for open borders and easily caricatured as such by opponents, including President Trump. The rhetoric has prompted concerns that the party is alienating moderates and independents who support some level of border enforcement.\n\nAnother issue that has put the Democrats on the defensive is the treatment of Trump administration officials. Liberal voices have been vocal in their criticism, with some advocating for the harassment of officials such as Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kirstjen Nielsen, and Stephen Miller. This has led to calls for distancing from such rhetoric, as it risks being perceived as condoning personal harassment of government officials.\n\nFurthermore, the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy has sparked a debate over Supreme Court nominations. Some liberal commentators are demanding that Democrats block any vote on any Trump nominee this year, citing the treatment of Merrick Garland in 2016. This stance could potentially leave the party open to charges of obstruction.\n\nThe Washington Post highlighted these challenges in a front-page story, stating, \"Growing liberal agitation over a pivotal Supreme Court retirement and a simmering crisis about immigrant child separation have left Democratic leaders scrambling to keep the political outrage they'd counted on to fuel midterm election wins from becoming a liability for the party.\"\n\nThe article also noted that \"Bernie Sanders-style rhetoric, including costly guarantees of government jobs, free health care, and free college could backfire in parts of the country where Trump won in 2016, and where Democrats will have to win in November to reclaim control of Congress.\"\n\nThese developments underscore the challenge of balancing the party's progressive wing with the need to appeal to moderate and independent voters in key states. While a handful of presidential aspirants may not speak for the entire party, their positions and the media attention they receive can significantly influence the party's image and electoral strategy.",
    " Title: Obama Hails Progress of Iran Nuclear Deal, Addresses Missile Program and Detained Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama, in a speech on Sunday, declared that the United States, the region, and the world will be more secure due to the recently completed nuclear deal with Iran. He stated, \"This is a good day, because once again we're seeing what's possible with strong American diplomacy.\"\n\nThe nuclear deal, which was finalized over a 24-hour period, marks a significant milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Obama emphasized, \"Yesterday marked a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\" He further added, \"We achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East.\"\n\nIn addition to the nuclear deal, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran has complied with its agreement to scale back its nuclear program. As a result, Obama signed an executive order lifting nuclear-related sanctions.\n\nIn a side agreement, Iran released five Americans who were held captive, and Obama granted clemency to seven Iranians held in the United States. Obama described his use of the constitutional pardon power as \"a one-time gesture to Iran, given the unique opportunity offered by this moment and the larger circumstances at play.\"\n\nObama also announced that the United States and Iran had settled a decades-long dispute regarding Iranian assets frozen during the 1979 Tehran hostage crisis. The $400 million in Iranian funds, intended to buy military equipment, were frozen when Muslim students stormed the United States embassy in Tehran and took 66 hostages. This money, along with $1.3 billion in interest, has been returned to settle claims at the Iran\u2013United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague. U.S. citizens had already recovered $2.5 billion in claims against Iran through the same tribunal, according to the State Department.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the Treasury Department announced it was imposing sanctions on 11 people and companies involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. Obama stated, \"We will continue to enforce these sanctions vigilantly.\"\n\nObama had initially planned to speak on Saturday night, but waited until all the Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, were able to leave Tehran. Two senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of the exchange, said two issues held up the plane's departure: The crew needed enough rest before the long flight to Switzerland, and they wanted to make sure that Rezaian's wife and mother were also on the plane.\n\nEven as Obama spoke to reporters in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Republican presidential candidates condemned the deal on Sunday morning television. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Fox News Sunday, stated, \"It reflects a pattern we've seen in the Obama administration over and over again of negotiating with terrorists, and making deals and trades that endanger U.S. safety and security.\" Cruz further added, \"Barack Obama is in the 'Let's-Make-A-Deal' business.\"",
    " Title: Keystone XL Oil Pipeline: What You Need to Know About the Contentious Project\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, a controversial project stretching from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico, is at the center of a years-long debate among politicians, energy companies, and environmentalists. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the completion of the pipeline, with President Obama potentially having the opportunity to sign off on or veto the project.\n\nHere are a few key points to help understand the Keystone XL pipeline debate:\n\n1. Completion Status and Function:\nApproximately 40% of the total project has been built, with oil flowing through two segments: a 298-mile stretch from Steele City, Nebraska, to Cushing, Oklahoma, and a 485-mile segment between Cushing and Nederland, Texas. The remaining segment, if approved, would run between Alberta and Steele City. If fully completed, the Keystone XL pipeline would be able to move up to 830,000 barrels a day of crude from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\n2. Environmental Impact:\nOpponents argue that some of the crude would be exported, but TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, states that this would not be financially viable. Alberta estimates it has the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. However, the oil is valuable only if producers can get it to a market where it can be sold. A pipeline is the least expensive way for the industry to do that.\n\nProducing crude from oil sands emits an estimated 17% more greenhouse gases than traditional oil drilling in the U.S. This is due in part to the need to heat the crude to separate it from the sand.\n\n3. Economic Impact:\nThe State Department estimates the construction phase would create about 42,000 direct and indirect jobs and generate about $2 billion in earnings in the U.S. Opponents dispute some of those numbers. Once construction is finished in about two years, the pipeline would create only about 50 new permanent jobs.\n\n4. Presidential Permit and Legal Challenge in Nebraska:\nBecause it crosses the U.S.-Canada border, the Keystone XL pipeline requires a \"presidential permit.\" President Obama has guarded this power jealously. In 2015, when Congress tried to force him to make a decision by issuing a 60-day deadline, he simply rejected the permit application.\n\nThe political challenge for Obama is that Democrats are divided on the issue, with construction unions favoring the project and some environmental activists opposing it. No matter what he decides, some constituents will be unhappy\u2014so the president has effectively stalled.\n\nIf the legislation passes the Senate Tuesday and becomes law, the pipeline would get an immediate green light.\n\n5. State Department Review and Legal Challenge in Nebraska:\nThe State Department was required to conduct an environmental assessment of the final, proposed leg of the pipeline because it will cross the U.S.-Canada border. The State Department's basic environmental review was completed in January. It concluded that the pipeline would have \"little impact\" on the price consumers pay for gasoline in the U.S.\n\nThe State Department is waiting for the outcome of a Nebraska Supreme Court case that could affect the pipeline's route. The court battle is over where the pipeline will be located, with opponents arguing that the governor does not have the authority to approve the new route.\n\n6. Alternative Pipelines and Legal Challenges:\nThere are other pipelines that can move oil sands crude (including a controversial plan by the company Enbridge), but there's not enough capacity for all the oil being produced in Alberta. Producers in Canada are pursuing transporting oil sands by rail cars, even though it's more expensive than moving it by pipeline.\n\nThat becomes even less attractive as world oil prices fall, however. Crude from oil sands is some of the most expensive oil to produce in the world. When the extra cost of moving it by rail is added on, some producers will find it difficult to make money.",
    " Title: Trump Aims for New Hampshire Victory in Final Day of Campaigning\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final day of campaigning before the New Hampshire Republican primary, businessman Donald Trump urged voters to support him in order to secure his first victory in the presidential primaries. Trump, who has led in polling in New Hampshire for the past six months, is the favorite to win, with around 30% of the vote.\n\nTrump received a warm welcome at the Verizon Wireless arena in downtown Manchester on Monday night, with thousands of supporters braving a storm to attend the rally. The candidate walked onto the stage to the Beatles song \"Revolution.\"\n\n\"So this is now crunch time,\" Trump said. \"We have a movement going that is incredible.\" He added, \"Tomorrow, you have to get out and you have to vote no matter what.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans and independents, who are allowed to vote in the GOP primary, are expected to help narrow the Republican field. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina and three current or former governors each need a strong showing to remain viable.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who finished third in Iowa, is hoping to regain his momentum after a rough debate performance on Saturday. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is aiming to avoid a significant drop from his first-place finish in Iowa.\n\nThe race will move on to South Carolina, where Trump also leads in the polls, then to Nevada, and then to Super Tuesday on March 1, when numerous delegates to the nominating convention are at stake. This showdown has been labeled the SEC primary because many of the battles are in states that make up the collegiate Southeastern Conference.\n\nTrump told the crowd, \"Tomorrow is going to be the beginning. We have to celebrate tomorrow evening. We have to have a great victory. It is so important because we are going to make America great again.\"\n\nTrump, along with the rest of the field, has been campaigning intensively in New Hampshire, targeting the large number of undecided voters. Sen. Rubio, hoping to regain his Iowa momentum, vowed to build a coalition that will be needed to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nSen. Rubio's debate stumble has energized the three governors - John Kasich of Ohio, Chris Christie of New Jersey, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush - who are competing to consolidate the support of donors and voters looking for an alternative to Trump and Cruz.\n\nGov. Kasich, at his 105th town hall meeting, said his appeal goes beyond the Republican Party to include blue-collar Democrats who helped power Ronald Reagan's winning campaigns. Gov. Bush continued to trade verbal barbs with Trump, criticizing the billionaire businessman's campaign for being based on insulting women, castigating Hispanics, and ridiculing disabled people.\n\nThree candidates dropped out of the race after the Iowa caucuses, and the primary in New Hampshire is likely to eliminate more. Political analysts suggest it will be challenging for Bush, Kasich, Christie, and Fiorina to survive disappointing showings.\n\nSpeaking in Hudson, Gov. Christie downplayed polls showing him struggling in the mid-single digits, stating that they were taken before Saturday's debate. He said that affair proved to voters that Rubio cannot carry himself.\n\n\"When the lights get that bright, you either shine or you melt,\" Christie said. \"We can not afford to have a president who melts.\"\n\nHistory suggests that the stakes are high in New Hampshire, as the eventual Republican nominee has won in either Iowa or New Hampshire since 1976. Trump faces lingering questions about whether he can turn his strong polling into victories after he led surveys in Iowa but finished second. However, Trump has since argued that his showing is more impressive than the pundits think, given that he is a political newcomer, the caucus process is \"weird\" and \"complex,\" and there are questions about whether the Cruz camp hurt his chances with some campaign shenanigans.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus to Provide Clarity in Republican and Democratic Nominating Contests\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa caucuses, scheduled for Monday, will mark the culmination of over ten months of campaigning by more than a dozen presidential candidates from both the Republican and Democratic parties. The results of the caucuses could offer clarity in the nominating contests, although a high voter turnout could potentially complicate the picture.\n\nVoting in a caucus is more complex than in a primary, as Iowans must physically attend their designated caucus site at a specific time and, in some cases, stay for several hours. A large turnout is generally beneficial for the two frontrunners, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, while a lower turnout could advantage Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. Both Trump and Sanders have been actively reaching out to first-time caucus-goers, with Trump appealing to non-college-educated, white, working-class voters, and Sanders targeting young voters.\n\nThe previous record for Republican turnout in Iowa was 122,000 votes in 2012. If Trump manages to mobilize his supporters who attend his rallies to caucus sites on Monday, the number could potentially reach as high as 150,000 votes. In 2008, Barack Obama shattered Iowa records and helped the state's Democratic turnout reach 240,000. While a similar turnout is not expected this year, Sanders needs a turnout above the 124,000 that turned out in 2004 to remain competitive.\n\nWeather conditions could impact turnout, as a winter storm is predicted to start on Tuesday, potentially affecting Monday night's caucuses.\n\nThe state of Iowa is considered favorable terrain for Ted Cruz, with a significant conservative evangelical voter base. Cruz needs to win Iowa to maintain a viable path to the nomination. If Cruz finishes second to Trump, his road to the nomination will become significantly more challenging. Cruz has been emphasizing to his supporters that a Trump victory in Iowa would make him virtually unstoppable, as Trump does not need to win Iowa to secure the nomination but would gain considerable momentum.\n\nMarco Rubio has adopted a 3-2-1 strategy: placing third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire, and then winning a subsequent state. Rubio requires a strong third-place finish in Iowa to reassure donors of his clear path to the nomination. The Republican establishment is hoping to rally behind Rubio as an alternative to Trump or Cruz, but they have been hesitant to do so. A stronger-than-expected finish in Iowa could help Rubio consolidate the mainstream wing of the GOP.\n\nIf Rubio manages to surpass Cruz and finish second in Iowa, he will be well-positioned to place second to Trump in New Hampshire and emerge as the clear establishment alternative.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the question remains whether Bernie Sanders has the organizational prowess to unseat Hillary Clinton. Clinton, who finished third in Iowa eight years ago, has built a robust get-out-the-vote operation. However, organization alone is insufficient without enthusiasm, and Sanders has excited Democrats with his calls for breaking up the big banks and making college and healthcare free.\n\nSanders started organizing late in Iowa and, like Cruz, needs a victory in Iowa to maintain momentum. If Sanders beats Clinton in Iowa, it would be an upset, and he would head into New Hampshire with even more momentum. Sanders currently holds a significant lead in New Hampshire, as neighboring-state candidates typically do (Sanders is from Vermont). A win in both Iowa and New Hampshire for Sanders could alter the dynamic in the South, where Clinton has built a firewall based on her support among African-American Democrats.\n\nUnlike the Republican caucuses, Democrats report delegate totals, not vote totals. Delegates are awarded through a formula based on how candidates perform in precincts across the state. Sanders could potentially face a disadvantage in this regard, as his support has been heavily concentrated in college towns and urban areas. The Sanders campaign has been attempting to expand its reach to rural areas. Clinton's team is filled with Obama field-operation veterans who have built an organization for Clinton that reaches all of Iowa's 99 counties and 1,683 precincts.\n\nFor more information, NPR's Iowa briefing book is available for download.

    " Title: Illinois Man with Concealed Carry Permit Stops Armed Robbery Suspect, Crime Rates Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nAn 86-year-old Illinois man, whose identity remains undisclosed, used his concealed carry permit to stop an armed robbery suspect last month. The man, described as a \"model citizen\" by law enforcement authorities, prevented others from entering an AT&T store during a holdup and allowed the police to make an arrest.\n\nSince Illinois started granting concealed carry permits this year, the number of robberies resulting in arrests in Chicago has decreased by 20 percent compared to the previous year, according to police department statistics. Reports of burglary and motor vehicle theft are also down by 20 percent and 26 percent, respectively. In the first quarter, the city's homicide rate was at a 56-year low.\n\nRichard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, attributes the decrease in crime rates to the increased number of concealed carry permit holders. \"It isn't any coincidence crime rates started to go down when concealed carry was permitted,\" said Pearson. \"The police department hasn't changed a single tactic\u2014they haven't announced a shift in policy or of course\u2014and yet you have these incredible numbers.\"\n\nAs of July 29, the state had 83,183 applications for concealed carry permits, with 68,549 licenses issued. By the end of the year, Mr. Pearson estimates that 100,000 Illinois citizens will be carrying concealed weapons. When Illinois began processing requests in January, gun training and shooting classes\u2014required for the application\u2014were filling up before the rifle association was able to schedule them, according to Mr. Pearson.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department has credited better police work as a reason for the lower crime rates this year. Police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy noted the confiscation of more than 1,300 illegal guns in the first three months of the year, better police training, and \"intelligent policing strategies.\"\n\nThe Chicago Police Department did not respond to a request for comment from The \u2588\u2588\u2588. However, the impact of concealed carry cannot be dismissed. Instead of creating more crimes, as many gun control advocates warn, increased concealed carry rates have coincided with lower rates of crime.\n\nA July study by the Crime Prevention Research Center found that 11.1 million Americans have permits to carry concealed weapons, a 147 percent increase from 4.5 million seven years ago. Meanwhile, homicide and other violent crime rates have dropped by 22 percent.\n\nJohn Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, stated, \"There's a lot of academic research that's been done on this, and if you look at the peer-reviewed studies, the bottom line is a large majority find a benefit of concealed carry on crime rates\u2014and, at worst, there's no cost.\"\n\nWithin Illinois, Cook County, which encompasses Chicago, has the state's largest number of concealed carry applications, with 28,552 requests, according to the county's website. Accounting for population, however, less than 1 percent are carrying. Mason County has the top per-capita rate in Illinois, with 14 percent of its residents holding concealed carry licenses, followed by Shelby County, with 9 percent.\n\nSheriff Miller of Shelby County, located in southwestern Illinois, about an hour and 45 minutes driving time from St. Louis, attributes the high concealed carry rate to residents wanting to exercise their Second Amendment rights. He doesn't anticipate concealed carry to change the statistics much, as the county doesn't have a significant gang problem or serious violent crime.\n\nMason County Sheriff Paul Gann said it's too early to tell whether an increased carry rate will have an influence on crime rates. \"What I can tell you is we haven't seen a spike in crime,\" said Mr. Gann. \"We haven't seen a spike in anything that's gun-related\u2014brandishing a firearm, shootings, robberies, nothing. These are law-abiding individuals.\"\n\nFrom a national perspective, Florida has the most active concealed carry permits, at nearly 1.3 million. Texas is second, with just over 708,000. Hawaii, at 183, has the fewest of states whose data were available. At 300,000 concealed carry licenses, Illinois would compare with Virginia, which has 363,274, and Alabama, with 379,917.",
    " Title: President Trump Cancels Denmark Visit Over Greenland Purchase Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Tuesday, citing Frederiksen's dismissal of the idea of the U.S. purchasing Greenland as \"absurd.\" The visit, initially scheduled for September 2-3, was part of Trump's trip to Europe, but there were no solid indications that the visit was centered on buying Greenland until Trump's Tuesday tweets.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump wrote, \"Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time.\" He added, \"The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct.\"\n\nThe White House later confirmed that the entire trip to Denmark, including a planned meeting with the Queen of Denmark, had been scrapped. The sudden cancellation came as a surprise to many, including U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, who tweeted just hours before Trump's pullout, \"Denmark is ready for the POTUS @realDonaldTrump visit!\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported last week that Trump was interested in buying Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory under Danish control with a population of approximately 56,000. According to the paper, Trump asked his advisers about acquiring the island due to Greenland's \"abundant resources and geopolitical importance.\"\n\nIn the past, the U.S. made a similar effort to buy Greenland in 1947, albeit without the publicity of social media. The idea led some left-wing commentators to mock the White House, but most found humor in the situation. Trump himself seemed to join in on Monday, tweeting a meme depicting a lavish Trump skyscraper looming over a mostly empty village in Greenland.\n\nHowever, Greenland is not for sale, according to Frederiksen. \"Greenland is not Danish. Greenland is Greenlandic. I persistently hope that this is not something that is seriously meant,\" Frederiksen told reporters during a trip to meet Kim Kielsen, the premier of Greenland.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in New Jersey on Sunday, Trump compared the proposal to \"a large real estate deal.\" He stated, \"A lot of things can be done. It\u2019s hurting Denmark very badly because they're losing almost $700 million a year carrying it [Greenland]. So, they carry it at great loss, and strategically for the United States, it would be nice. And, we're a big ally of Denmark and we help Denmark.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump said buying Greenland was not a top priority for him or his administration.",
    " Title: The Invaluable Contribution of Women Judges: A Perspective from Leah Ward Sears, Former Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nRetired Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, Leah Ward Sears, has expressed her support for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's intention to serve on the bench for at least five more years, until she turns 90. Sears, who is a partner in the litigation section at Smith, Gambrell & Russell, LLP, emphasizes the unique and invaluable role women like Ginsburg have played in shaping a fair and just jurisprudence in the United States.\n\nIn her commentary, Sears highlights the erosion of the \"judicial boys' club\" as women began to serve as judges and take more gender-sensitive positions. She points to Ginsburg's significant role in exposing hidden gender biases and working towards improving the situation for women and everyone else.\n\nOne of Ginsburg's notable decisions was the 1996 majority opinion in United States v. Virginia, where she argued against gender-exclusive admissions policies, stating that such policies are not inherently unsuitable for women. In the 2016 case Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, Ginsburg's concurring opinion emphasized the risks women face when access to safe and legal procedures is severely limited.\n\nSears argues that women's lives, with their higher likelihood of experiencing discrimination and the burdens of child and elder care, add a unique perspective to judicial discussions.
